      "text" : "State-of-the-art methods in authorship attribution, which aims to determine an unknown text’s author among a set of candidate authors, rely on low-level information such as character n-grams (Frantzeskou and Stamatatos, 2007). Recent approaches (Koppel et al., 2011) focus on largescale authorship attribution for thousands of authors, but are expensive during prediction, which is a deficit in on-line scenarios for purposes of tar-\ngeted marketing, copyright enforcement, writing support, and search relevance, among others (Potthast et al., 2016). Furthermore, besides stylistic information, word-level topical information has been shown to be relevant for authorship attribution (Seroussi et al., 2011).\nSimultaneously, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable successes in computer vision (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) and speech recognition (Abdel-Hamid et al., 2012) and have been found particularly suitable for extracting information from just such low-level signals. They have also been shown to be effective for various NLP tasks (Collobert et al., 2011) and have achieved state-of-the-art in several sentence classification tasks (Kim, 2014). Most neural networks and CNNs in NLP perform convolutions on the word level using pre-trained word embeddings (Mikolov et al., 2013). Recent approaches employ convolutions over characters (Zhang et al., 2015).\nWe apply CNNs to the task of authorship attribution for four reasons: a) They have been shown to be excellent at leveraging character-level signals, which have been found to be indicative of authorial style (Stamatatos, 2009); b) they have excelled at differentiating between a large number of classes (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), which is key for large-scale authorship attribution; c) prediction is fast; and d) a combination of word and character input channels enables them to take topical information into account.\nOur main contributions are the following:\n• We present state-of-the-art results for largescale authorship attribution for four out of five datasets in different domains using character-level convolutional neural networks.\n• We evaluate combinations of different CNN input channels and propose a novel model\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n06 68\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n1 Se\np 20\n16\nthat combines character and word channels.\n• We compare CNN approaches against traditional approaches for a large range of author numbers and discuss merits and improvements.\n• We present the first application of authorship attribution to reddit comments and introduce two new Twitter and reddit datasets that we make available for further research."

      "text" : "Our work is inspired by two neural network architectures: multi-channel CNNs and character-level CNNs.\nMulti-channel CNNs are pervasive in domains where the input can naturally be separated into different channels, e.g. color channels in computer vision, wave lengths in speech recognition (Hoshen et al., 2014). Natural language input is typically single-channel in the form of tokens or characters. Kim (2014) observe that a static word channel is able to encode general semantic similarities, while a non-static channel can be fine-tuned to the task at hand and improves performance on some datasets.\nCharacter-level CNNs have been shown to outperform traditional classification methods on large-scale datasets (Zhang et al., 2015). Their CNNs, however, require tens of thousands of perclass examples and thousands of training epochs, while our datasets only contain a few hundred examples per class.\nThe use of most other character-level CNNs is motivated by the desire to leverage sub-word information (e.g. morphemes) to which word-level CNNs are blind: Kim et al. (2016) feed the output of a character-level CNN to a recurrent neural language model and improve performance particularly for morphologically rich languages.\nSantos and Zadrozny (2014) use a CNN that associates a character embedding produced by a CNN for each word with its word representation to improve POS tagging performance for English and Portuguese, while Santos and Guimarães (2015) use the same network to boost results for named entity recognition. In contrast to their approach, we do not aim to detect morphological information because inter-word features such as punctuation and white space are very relevant to authorship. Rather, we treat characters as a distinct input\nchannel as our goal is to learn to identify discrete word and character patterns and to associate them with each other.\nAuthorship attribution is the task of identifying an unknown text’s author among a set of candidate authors with applications ranging from plagiarism detection to Forensic Linguistics. The key notion behind statistical authorship attribution is that measuring textual features enables distinction between texts written by different authors (Stamatatos, 2009). These features range from indicators of content divergence between authors such as bag-of-words to stylometric features that reflect an author’s unique writing patterns, e.g. use of punctuation marks, emoticons, whitespace, etc. (Sapkota et al., 2015), and character and word n-grams (Schwartz et al., 2013).\nDeep learning research has largely neglected authorship attribution; related work has instead focused on modeling an author’s style: Kiros et al. (2014) condition word embeddings on attributes such as style and predict an author’s age, gender, and industry. Zhu et al. (2015) transform image captions into book sentences by subtracting the ’style’. State-of-the-art authorship attribution algorithms have to handle possibly thousands of candidate authors and a limited number of examples per author in real-world applications but require CPU-days for prediction as they calculate pairwise distances between feature subsets (Koppel et al., 2011). Simultaneously, character ngrams have proven to be the single most successful feature (Frantzeskou and Stamatatos, 2007). Finally, Potthast et al. (2016) compare traditional approaches on small datasets, while we evaluate state-of-the-art as well as CNN-based methods for thousands of authors, thereby moving a step closer to the goal of authorship attribution at web-scale."

      "text" : "The model architecture we use is an extension of the CNN structure used by Collobert et al. (2011). Its variant with two word embedding channels used by Kim (2014) is depicted in Figure 1.\nThe model takes as input a text, which is padded to length n. For the character embedding channel, we represent the text as a concatenation of its character embeddings z1:m where zi ∈ Rk is the k-dimensional vector of the i-th character in the text andm is the character length of the text, while for the word embedding channel, we represent the\ntext as a concatentation of its word embeddings x1:n where xi ∈ Rk is the k-dimensional vector of the i-th word in the text. The convolutional layer slides filters of different window sizes over each input channel. Each filter with weights w ∈ Rhk generates a new feature ci for a window of h characters or words according to the following operation:\nci = f(w · xi:i+h−1 + b) (1)\nNote that b ∈ R is a bias term and f is a nonlinear function, ReLU (Nair and Hinton, 2010) in our case. The application of the filter over each possible window of h words or characters in the sentence produces the following feature map:\nc = [c1, c2, ..., cn−h+1] (2)\nMax-over-time pooling (Collobert et al., 2011) in turn condenses this feature vector to its most important feature by taking its maximum value and naturally deals with variable input lengths. A final softmax layer takes the concatenation of the maximum values of the feature maps produced by all filters and outputs a probability distribution over all candidate authors.\nFor the standard single-channel character-level CNN, we represent characters as one-hot vectors.1\nIn the multi-channel architecture, we apply each filter to both channels and sum the results2 to calculate ci in equation 1. Note that in order to com-\n1Using low-dimensional character embeddings as in Kim et al. (2016) decreased performance.\n2We have also experimented with concatenation, which produces slightly worse results.\nbine a word and character channel, both spaces must have the same dimensionality. We thus embed characters in a space with the same number of dimensions as the word embedding space and pad the word sequence to have the same length as the character sequence.3"

Features are additionally weighted with tf-idf and scaled to have unit variance.\n• SCAP: the Source Code Author Profile (SCAP) method (Frantzeskou and Stamatatos, 2007) determines authorship based on the intersection of the most frequent character n-grams of an unknown text and an author’s profile, i.e. the concatentation of an author’s known texts.\n• Imposters: the Imposters Method (Koppel et al., 2011) is based on the intuition that the profile of an unknown text’s author is likely to be most similar to the unknown text most often as the feature set varies. For each iteration, it calculates the cosine similarity of a random fraction of a feature set of spacefree character n-grams between an unknown text and an author’s profile. It then chooses the author who exhibited the maximum cosine similarity most frequently.\n11For the Twitter dataset 200-dimensional GloVe vectors trained on 27B tokens of Twitter data are used.\n• LDAH-S: LDA Hellinger Single-Document, the top-performing method of Seroussi et al. (2011) uses Hellinger distance between the LDA topic distributions for an unknown text and an author’s profile as a measure for authorship.\nResults for SVM+Stems have been reported on the Email dataset (Allison and Guthrie, 2008) and results for Imposters and LDAH-S have been reported on the IMDb62 and Blog dataset (Seroussi et al., 2011). However, as there are no predefined train-test splits for these datasets, we reimplement the above algorithms to guarantee identical conditions and objective comparison."

For each number of authors n, we select the subset of texts belonging to the n most authors with the most documents in the dataset. Note that as we scale the number of authors, the number of documents per author diminishes and identifying prominent authors transforms into the scenario of detecting authors with only few samples. We do not equalize the number of training documents to maintain the imbalanced distribution common in real-world applications.\nAs the per-fold run time of most of the state-ofthe-art authorship attribution methods renders 10- fold cross-validation prohibitively expensive, we randomly split off 10% as a stratified test set. We keep the test set constant and use a seed to reduce randomness in the comparison. We furthermore use 10% of each training set as a stratified development set. We optimize hyperparameters for all comparison algorithms for each dataset on the development set of its 10-author subset using random search and keep them constant each dataset. For SVM+Stems, we use a linear kernel, unigram\nstems, and a vocabulary size of 10,000. The parameters for the other algorithms can be seen in Table 2.\nCNN parameters. We optimize hyperparameters for our CNN configurations on the development set of the 10-authors emails subset without any task-specific fine-tuning.

We train for 15 epochs using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent and early stopping.

      "text" : "The corpus domain has a big impact on a model’s performance and often requires domain-specific feature engineering (Stamatatos, 2009). Wordbased methods such as SVM+Stems, LDAH-S,\n12We use the same vocabulary as Zhang et al. (2015), but distinguish between lower-case and upper-case characters and convolve all numbers into one as both measures increase performance.\nCNN-word, CNN-word-word perform well in domains in which topical information is discriminatory, such as emails, movie reviews, and blogs. They, however, achieve comparatively worse performance for short-message domains such as Twitter and reddit. On these, character-enhanced methods provide a considerable performance boost. Past studies (Stamatatos, 2009; Schwartz et al., 2013) highlighted challenges for short text authorship attribution, such as the number of authors, the training set size, and the size of the test document.\nTwitter. The generally impressive scores in the Twitter domain reveal a bias that is two-fold: a) As we have not pre-processed the data (other than lower-casing) to reflect real-world use cases, models are able to leverage mentions and hashtags to achieve high F1 scores; replacing these lowers scores for all models as observed by Layton (2010); b) celebrities and power-users that are the subject of this dataset use language differently in comparison to regular users, with the goal of enhancing their brand by frequently tweeting similar key messages. This behavior, however, makes it easier for models to pick up on their individual style or preferred content. We intend to investigate the stylistic differences between regular users and celebrities and their impact on authorship attribution in future work.\nReddit. Most models perform poorly on the reddit domain. We suspect that authorship attribution on reddit is challenging for two reasons: a) Comments are either very long (tirades / explanations) or very short (short replies / puns); b) in contrast to Twitter, reddit is less about broadcasting\noneself to the world and more about interacting with the community; posts thus often reflect the character of the thread rather than the character of the user and often contain stylistically conspicuous features such as irony (Wallace et al., 2015). Further research may thus reveal how users shift their style and if this behavior differs across different subreddits."

      "heading" : "6.2 CNNs",
      "text" : "All of our CNN variants consistently outperform most traditional authorship attribution methods. Even CNN-word that only uses word embeddings performs significantly better than most comparison methods. Moreover, CNNs show aptitude to handle the class imbalance problem (Stamatatos, 2007) inherent in real-world applications by significantly outperforming the comparison methods on all datasets with imbalanced numbers of documents per author (see Table 1) in line with findings by Potthast et al. (2016).\nIn the emails domain, CNNs outperform the comparison methods by more than 6 %. for 10 authors and SCAP by more than 16 %. for 144 authors. We suppose that these large performance differences lie in the fact that CNNs are able to pay special attention to structural measures such as greetings, farewells, and signatures (de Vel et al., 2001). Differences for the IMDb domain are less pronounced, as authors would generally review similar movies, rendering specific words or character sequences discriminatory. Fine-tuned word embeddings that are sensitive to topical divergence between authors boost CNN performance in the\nblogs domain. They are, however, less helpful in the Twitter and reddit domains, where hashtags or emoticons are the most characteristic features.\nCharacter-level CNNs outperform traditional methods and CNN variants on 4 out of 5 datasets in Table 3, on most of them quite significantly. They outperform comparison methods in domains such as Reddit where certain character sequences such as smileys and emoticons are discriminatory by more than 12 %. for 10 authors. They perform well even with fewer per-class examples scaling better than all other methods (except for SCAP on Twitter in Figure 4) to large numbers of authors.\nThe reason for the success of character-level CNNs clearly is their superior ability to capture stylistic information encoded on the characterlevel. In contrast to traditional approaches such as SCAP and Imposters, character-level CNNs are able to model more complex interactions between different stylistic features by leveraging non-linearities.\nGiven the availability of a GPU, they only take a few hours to train – even for large-scale authorship attribution scenarios as the author number only affects the number of parameters in the final softmax layer, which scales linearly. More importantly, they are able to form a prediction instantaneously compared to the CPU-hours or CPUdays required by SCAP or the Imposters method respectively. For this reason, they are particularly suited for conducting a large or recurring number of predictions in on-line scenarios such as attributing messages to known terrorists (Abbasi and Chen, 2005).\nHybrid-channel CNNs outperform CNNs that rely solely on word embeddings, as character-level\ninformation is important for the task of authorship attribution. In the blogs domain, where topical information is a distinguishing feature, they outperform character-level CNNs in Table 3. Using a static and a non-static word channel together with the character channel had similar effects as using a multi-channel architecture over a regular word-based CNN, i.e. it increased scores on some datasets."

The optimal profile size for our datasets, 14,000, however, is considerably higher than past values reported for this hyperparameter (Layton et al., 2010) (Layton et al., 2012), suggesting that larger ranges should be considered in future research.\nWe have found that restricting the vocabulary size by selecting only the 30,000 most frequent space-free character n-grams for the Imposters method generally increased performance as frequency is the most important criterion for selecting features in authorship attribution (Stamatatos, 2009).13 Even though we improve performance for Imposters on the IMDb dataset in comparison to Seroussi et al. (2011) by selecting appropriate hyperparameters, we are unable to achieve competitive scores using the more recently proposed authorship attribution methods, Imposters\n13Koppel et al. (2011) use more than 250,000 unique character n-grams.\nand LDAH-S.14 In contrast, the SCAP method proves to be easy and fast to train and outperforms CNNs on the IMDb dataset in Table 3.\nImpressively, SCAP scales better than CNNs on Twitter in Figure 4. Recall that for Twitter influencers, certain n-grams such as user mentions or hashtags are highly indicative. We suspect that as SCAP stores discrete n-grams for each author, it is better able to assign them to the correct author, while the continuous function used by CNNs might blur the boundaries in the case of many authors. To mitigate this deficit, CNNs can a) be made more expressive by adding more layers (Zhang et al., 2015); or b) can be interpolated with n-grams that capture clear n-gram-author correspondences as in the Twitter domain."

Recently, characterlevel and multi-channel CNNs have exhibited excellent performance for sentence classification tasks. We apply CNNs to large-scale authorship attribution, which aims to determine an unknown text’s author among many candidate authors, motivated by their ability to process characterlevel signals and to differentiate between a large number of classes, while making fast predictions in comparison to state-ofthe-art approaches. We extensively evaluate CNN-based approaches that leverage word and character channels and compare them against state-of-the-art methods for a large range of author numbers, shedding new light on traditional approaches. We show that character-level CNNs outperform the state-of-the-art on four out of five datasets in different domains. Additionally, we present the first application of authorship attribution to reddit. Finally, we release our new reddit and Twitter datasets for further research.",
