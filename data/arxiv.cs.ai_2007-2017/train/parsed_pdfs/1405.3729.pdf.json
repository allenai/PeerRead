      "text" : "Data mining was presented in the 1990s.Data mining roots are traced along three family lines: Statistics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning.\nStatistics founds many technologies such as regression analysis, standard distribution, standard variance, standard deviation, cluster analysis, discriminate analysis. The data mining is built on these technologies and these technologies are helpful to study data and data relationships also. Data mining classification algorithms use statistical method to create decision tree and rules to validate machine learning based model. Artificial Intelligence is based on heuristics and it is used to apply human thought processing to statistical issues. Data Mining adopts ideas from artificial intelligence and pattern recognition fields such as signal processing or visualization techniques. Machine Learning is combination of Statistics and AI. It is a evolution of artificial intelligence, because it mixes Artificial intelligence heuristics with advanced statistical analysis. Figure 1.1 shows intersection of data mining with various related technologies.\nFigure 1.1: Intersection of technologies yielding to data mining"

Data mining software is an analytical tool that allows analyzing, categorizing and summarizing the data. Data mining process has five elements that can be summarized as:\n Extraction, transformation, and loading transaction data onto the data warehouse system.\n Storing and managing the data in a database system(multidimensional).\n Providing data access facility to business analysts and professionals.\n Analyzing the data (by application software)\n Present the data in a graph or table."

      "text" : " Classification: Classification is the best & popular approach. Classification is the process of finding a set of models or functions that describe and distinguish data classes or concepts, for the purpose of being able to use the model to predict the class of objects whose class label is unknown, Unlike a classification model, the purpose of prediction model is to determine the future outcome rather than the current behaviour. Its output can be categorical or numeric value. It is a supervised learning because the classes are determined before examining the data.\n Clustering: Clustering is best suitable for finding groups of similar data items. In Clustering, a set of data items is partitioned into a set of classes such that similar characteristics items are grouped together.\n Association analysis: It is used to discover relationships between attributes and items such as the presence of one pattern implies the presence of another pattern. Association Rule is a popular technique for market basket analysis\nbecause all possible combinations of interesting product groupings can be explored .\n Decision Tree: It is a tree structure like a flow-chart, in which the rectangular boxes are called the node. Each node represents a set of records from the original data set. Internal node is a node that has a child and leaf (terminal) node is nodes that don’t have children. Root node is a topmost node. The decision tree is used for finding the best way to distinguish a class from another class. There are five mostly & commonly used algorithms for decision tree: - ID3, CART, CHAID, C4.5 algorithm and J48."

There is more competition between all institutes for attracting students to get enrollment in their institutes so they focus on strength of students not quality of education at the time of enrollment.\nToday Admission process of institutes has become very critical. There are many problems at the time of admission in institutes because many students apply for courses but seats are limited, so there is no proper seat allocation of courses to the students so students are unable to get enroll in their interested courses. Some students have good marks but they get admission in other course (that is not according to their subjects) due to limited seats.\nSo there is a proper attention is needed in admission process. Every year huge amount of student data is recorded in database however this data is not put in proper form. There is a requirement of data mining that handle these challenges & overcome them. Then there is enough information for better planning, evaluation and decision making. Data mining will extract hidden information from student enrollment database, this information will be meaningful for institutes.Then a better & mined knowledge is present in database that can be use directly, there is no extra requirement.\nThe motive behind in this paper is based on classification model for enrollment in higher educational courses using data mining techniques. This is useful for predicting the students that are interested to take admission in higher study course, this is also useful to select a good student for a particular course & also useful to give guidelines to student about selection of course. By this study we will find some meaningful pattern that can be useful for institutes.\n1.6 Thesis Organization The organization of the rest of this thesis is as follows:\n Chapter 2 presents the related work\n Chapter 3 discusses the research methodology that presents results, conclusion and future directions about the work done in the thesis\n Chapter4 discusses the References.\nCHAPTER 2 RELATED WORK\nData mining extract hidden patterns from the student database that provides help to university in education. The educational data mining is a recent and popular area, there are many journals, ongoing books, workshops [1]. Delavari and Beikzadeh [2] give knowledge to use data mining methods in Higher learning institutions and define how data mining can be applied to the educational data. R. R. Kabra and R. S. Bichkar [3] define that a model can be created using student’s past-academic performance with the help of decision tree algorithm and this model can predict student’s performance in the first year of engineering exam. Oladipupo and oyelade [4] show their study in which student’s failure patterns are identified using association rule data mining technique. Their study trims down failure rate and improves academic performance. Zlatko J. Kovacic [5] show a case study for student’s success prediction using educational data mining. For classify successful and unsuccessful students the CHAID and CART algorithm were applied on enrollment data of open polytechnic (New Zealand). Nguyen et al. [6] predict the performance of undergraduate and postgraduate students at two different institutes using decision tree and Bayesian network and this is used to find and helping failing students and determines scholarship. In this result, decision tree gives better accuracy than Bayesian network. Hijazi and Naqvi [7] show a case study on student performance. In this study 300 student’s sample is taken from colleges of Punjab university(Pakistan) and they determine that high correlation is present between some factor (mother’s education factor and student’s family income factor) and student performance. T.Miranda Lakshmi, A.Martin, R.Mumtaj Begum and Dr.V.Prasanna Venkatesan [8] conduct a case study on student’s qualitative data using decision tree algorithms to identify the effect of qualitative data in the performance of the student. Mohammed M. Abu Tair, Alaa M. El-Halees [9] conduct a case study on graduate students’ data using data mining techniques to improve performance and extract useful knowledge from this data. Sunita B.Aher, L.M.R.J. lobo [10] conduct a comparative study to predict course selection using association rule algorithms.\nUmesh Kumar Pandey and S. Pal [11] administrate a study in which 600 student’s data sample is taken from Dr. M.L. Awadh University’s colleges ,Faizabad and found that whether new student will perform or not. Bhise R. B, Thorat S.S and Supekar A.K. [12] performed data mining process on the student’s database using clustering- K-mean algorithm. K.Shanmuga Priya and A.V.Senthil Kumar [13] use a classification method that helps to improve the performance & extract the knowledge from student’s final semester marks. Varun Kumar and Anupama Chadha [14] used association rule technique to improve the performance of postgraduate students. They focus on many factors like student’s interest, teaching methodologies, curriculum design using association rule mining and these factors can affect post graduate student’s performance. Abeer Badr El Din Ahmed and Ibrahim Sayed Elaraby [15] use decision tree technique for data classification that is helpful for predicting the student’s final grade. In 1986 J.R Quinlan summarizes an approach and describes ID3 and this was the first research work on ID3 algorithm [16].Anand Bahety implemented the ID3 algorithm on the “Play Tennis” database and classified whether the weather is suitable for playing tennis or not?.Their results concluded that ID3 doesn’t works well in continuous attributes but gives good results for missing values [17]. Mary Slocum gives the implementation of the ID3 in the medical area. She transforms the data into information to make a decision and performed the task of collecting and cleaning the data .Entropy and Information Gain concepts are used in this study [18]. Kumar Ashok (et.al) performed the id3 algorithm classification on the “census 2011 of India” data to improving or implementing a policy for right people. The concept of information theory is used here. In the decision tree a property on the basis of calculation is selected as the root of the tree and this process’s steps are repeated [19]. Sonika Tiwari used the ID3 algorithm for detecting Network Anomalies with horizontal portioning based decision tree and applies different clustering algorithms. She checks the network anomalies from the decision tree then she discovers the comparative analysis of different clustering algorithms and existing id3 decision tree [20]. Yadav, Bharadwaj and Pal [21] obtained the students data such as attendance, seminar, assignment marks and class test to predict the end semester performance using three algorithms ID3decision tree, C4.5 and CART and result shows that CART gives better result for classification of data.\nPandey and Pal [22] show their study using association rule analysis to find the student interest of choosing class language. In this paper they use seven different interestingness measures. Their result concluded that student has shown their interest in mix mode class language. Bharadwaj and Pal [23] use the classification decision tree technique to evaluate student’ end semester performance, this study helps to identify the dropouts and students who require special attention and teacher advising. AI-Radaideh. et al [24] presents a classification based model for student performance prediction using ID3 algorithm,C4.5 and Naïve Bayes algorithm but decision tree had better results. K.S. Priya and A.V.S. kumar [25] use a classification approach that extracts the knowledge from student end semester marks.\nData Mining can be used in educational field to enhance our understanding of learning process to focus on extracting and identifying the variables of the learning process of students as described by Alaa el- Halees [26]. Han and Kamber [27] describes data mining software that allow the users to analyze data from different views, and summarize these relationships which are identified during the mining process. Divakar, R.C Jain [28] applied four classification methods on student academic data i.e Decision tree (ID3), Multilayers perceptron, Decision table & Naïve Bayes classification method. Shaeela Ayesha, Tasleem Mustafa, Ahsan Raza Sattar, and M. Inayat Khan [29] applied K-mean clustering to analyze learning behavior of students which will help the tutor to improve the performance of students and reduce the dropout ratio to a significant level.D’Mello [30] studied on bored and frustrated student.\nCHAPTER 3 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n3.1 CLASSIFICATION FOR MCA STUDENT DATA In recent years, Indian higher educational institutes grow rapidly. There is more competition between institutes for attracting students to get enrollment in their institutes. The admission process is conducted every year at the institute and it results in the recording of large amounts of data. But, in most of the cases this data is not properly utilized (or analyzed) and results in wastage of what would otherwise be one of the most precious assets of the institutes. By applying the various data mining techniques on this data one can get valuable information and predictions can be done for the betterment of the admission process. This study presents data mining techniques for the enrollment process in MCA stream. These methods will help to improve the overall performance of the admission process at higher educational institutes.\n3.1.1 Data Used (Data Collection & Data Preprocessing)  The MCA student data include: Category, Father Qualification, Mother\nQualification, XII Medium, XII Stream, Mathematics Grade in XII, XII Grade, UG Stream, UG Medium, UG Grade, PG Grade.\n Some attributes are selected using attribute selection measure, these attributes are Mathematics Grade in XII, XII Grade, UG Stream, UG Grade, PG Grade.\n The next step of our application focuses on transforming these data in order to be\nused in Weka, a data mining specialized software. Since ID3 algorithm can only work with categorical variables, we have to adapt the data. With this intention we will make some transformations:\n The Mathematics Grade in XII values will be encoded like: A– (80-89), B – (70-\n79), C – (60-69), D – (50-59), E – (40-49), F<=35, not applicable\n The XII Grade values will be normalized, after normalization each ones having attached a Grade A– (80-89), B – (70-79), C – (60-69), D – (50-59), E – (40-49)\nAfter Normalization if XII Per <=0 THEN E if XII Per <=0.25 THEN D\nif XII Per <=0.487 THEN C if XII Per <=0.75 THEN B Else A\n The UG Grade values will be normalized, after normalization each ones having\nattached a Grade A– (80-89), B – (70-79), C – (60-69), D – (50-59), E – (40-49) After Normalization\nif UG Per <=0 THEN E if UG Per <=0.11 THEN D if UG Per <=0.41 THEN C if UG Per <=0.70 THEN B Else A\n The PG Grade values will be normalized, after normalization each ones having attached a Grade A– (80-89), B – (70-79), C – (60-69), D – (50-59), E – (40-49) After Normalization\nif PG Per <=0 THEN E if PG Per <=0.23 THEN D\nif PG Per <=0.46 THEN C if PG Per <=0.74 THEN B Else A\n3.1.2 Used Tool WEKA:-\nFor the purposes of this study, we select WEKA (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) software that was developed at the University of Waikato in New Zealand. WEKA tool supports to a wider range of algorithms & very large data sets. The Weka (pronounced Waykuh) workbench contains a collection of visualization tools & algorithms. WEKA is open source software issued under the GNU General Public License. It contains tools for data pre-processing, classification, regression, clustering, association rules, and visualization. The original non-java version of Weka was a TCL/TK, but the recent java based version is Weka 3(1997), is now used in many different application areas, in particular for education & research.\nWeka’s main user interface is Explorer. The Experimenter is also there by which we can compare weka’s machine learning algorithms’ performance. The Explorer interface has many panels by which we can access to main components of workbench. The Visualization tab allows visualizing a 2-D plot of the current working relation, it is very useful. In this study WEKA toolkit 3.6.9 is used for constructing the decision tree.\nFigure 3.1: WEKA 3.6.9 Interface"

The area under the ROC Curve (AUC) is a method of measuring the performance of the ROC curve. If AUC is 1 then the prediction is perfect; if it is 0.5 then the prediction is random. Analyzing our output we conclude that even if the prediction in this case is not perfect, it is not random as well. The best prediction is for class A – 0.96 and the “weak” prediction is 0.665 for class C. Between this extremes are the values 0.867 for class D and 0.835 for class B. Weighted Average:An average in which each quantity to be averaged is assigned a weight. These weightings determine the relative importance of each quantity on the average.

This study examines that student’s performance(past academic)can be used to construct a model using classification with a decision tree algorithm (ID3 and J48 decision tree algorithm).The concept of classification with Decision Tree helps to extracting the knowledge from the past academic data. In the confusion matrix of ID3 and J48, it is shown that out of four actual categories, the accuracy of D class is 78.3% and 69.6% respectively that means this model is successfully identifying the which student doesn’t perform better in MCA. So, there is a need for proper counseling for the students that are going to select in MCA course. This study also helps students in selecting the course for admission according to his skills and academics. It results in that B.Sc. students with Mathematics and BCA stream students performed better in MCA but B.Sc. without Mathematics stream students did not perform well.\n3.1.6 Testing We can make predictions for a test set, whether that set contains valid class values or not. The output will contain both the actual and predicted class.\nClassifying new data\nnew instance:- {B, A, BSC(Math), ?}.\n(The class attribute is ? because you don’t know the classification.)\nDo the following:\nSTEP1: Guess a value for ?

      "text" : "EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTES In recent years, Indian higher educational institute’s competition grows rapidly for attracting students to get enrollment in their institutes. To attract students educational institutes select a best advertisement method. There are different advertisements available in the market but a selection of them is very difficult for institutes. This study is helpful for institutes to select a best advertisement medium using some data mining methods. 3.2.1 Data Used In this study the data is collected through the questionnaire survey at the institute. There are 500 questionnaires are collected. This questionnaire includes student personnel and academic information. This study is helpful for finding a better advertisement for institutes so this questionnaire includes a important question “How They knows about this university”?\nTable 3.10 shows different advertisement methods that are available in questionnaire’s field. Table 3.11 shows different combination of advertisements occurrences that occur while responding the questionnaire field.\nTable 3.10: Different advertisement methods\nAdvertising methods Codes Answers\nFriends FR 309 Family FA 17 Internet Search IS 24 Online Advertising OA 8 Newspaper NE 8 Others OT 5\nTable 3.11: Different combination of advertisements\nRelations Occurrences Friends and Family(FRFA) 10 Friends and Internet Search (FRIS) 6 Friends and Online Advertising(FROA) 2 Friends and Newspaper (FRNE) 3 Friends and Others(FROT) 0 Family and Internet Search(FAIS) 0 Family and Online Advertising(FAOA) 0 Family and Newspaper (FANE) 7 Family and Others(FAOT) 0 Internet Search and Online Advertising(ISOA) 4 Internet Search and Newspaper(ISNE) 2 Internet Search and Others(ISOT) 0 Online Advertising and Newspaper(OANE) 2 Online Advertising 0\nand Others(OAOT) Newspaper and Others(NEOT)\n0\nTotal counts(support)\n36\n3.2.2 Analysis of Support and Confidence Value The support value of a data item indicates the percentage of database transaction in which that data item appears. Confidence value measures the rule’s strength. A small support and large confidence value are meaningful. Support and confidence analysis is shown in Table 3.12.Support and Confidence values are calculated as:\nSupport= Occurrences/Total Support Confidence=Support(X,Y)/Support(X)\nTable 3.12: Support and confidence analysis of different relations\nRelations Support = occurrences/Total Support\nConfidence = support(X,Y) / support(X)\nFA->FR 0.28 0.59 IS->FR 0.17 0.25 OA->FR 0.06 0.25 NE->FR 0.08 0.375 Friends and Others 0 - Family and Internet Search 0 - Family and Online Advertising 0 - NE->FA 0.19 0.875 Family and Others 0 - IS->OA 0.11 0.17 NE->IS 0.06 0.25 Internet Search and Others 0 - OA->NE 0.06 0.25 Online Advertising and Others 0 -\nFigure 3.21: Advertisement method’s links\n3.2.3 Cosine Value Analysis Cosine value occurs between 0 and 1.If its value is close to 1 then a good correlation occurs between X and Y. Cosine analysis formula defined as: Cosine(X->Y) = p(X,Y) / sqrt(p(X)*p(Y))\nTable 3.13: Cosine analysis of different relations\nRelations Cosine value=(p(X,Y)/sqrt(p(X)*p(Y)))\nFA->FR 0.13 IS->FR 0.06 OA->FR 0.04 NE->FR 0.06 NE->FA 0.60 IS->OA 0.28 NE->IS 0.14 OA->NE 0.25 From table 3.12 result it can conclude that 28% students have answered with family and friends. Since 28% is largest support then it is a better advertisement method and its confidence value is 59% shows that if 59% of the time family occurs then friends also occurs in response. Figure 3.21 concluded that the all advertisement methods are linked to either friend advertisement or newspaper advertisement medium. In figure 3.21 it is shown that friends and newspaper have five edges. In table 3.13, cosine values are calculated for all advertisement mediums and it concludes that\nFRFA FRIS FROA FRNE ISOA ISNE FANE OANE\nFR FA IS OA NE\nnewspaper → family has good relation to each other but others relations are not so close to each other. 3.2.4 Apriori algorithm implementation\nTable 3.14: Advertisement Methods data set\nRelations Code Occurrences(Support count) Friends FR 309 Family FA 17 Internet Search IS 24 Online Advertising OA 8 Newspaper NE 8 Others OT 5 Friends and Family FRFA 10 Friends and Internet Search FRIS 6\nFriends and Online Advertising FROA 2 Friends and Newspaper FRNE 3 Family and Newspaper FANE 7 Internet Search and Online Advertising ISOA 4 Internet Search and Newspaper ISNE 2 Online Advertising and Newspaper OANE 2\nStep 1: In this step the table 5 is scanned by algorithm and obtained information generates candidate item set C1 (shown in table 6).

Therefore, remove (FR,FA,NE) from C3.\n= > Minimum support (5)\nTable 3.19: Generated frequent item\nsets L2\nCode Support count FR,FA 10 FR,IS 6 FA,NE 7\nTable 3.20: Generated Candidate set C3\nL2*L2 L2-1 L2-2 FR,FA,IS FR,FA FR,IS FR,FA,NE FR,FA FA,NE FR,IS,FA,NE FR,IS FA,NE\n The subsets of (FR,IS,FA,NE) are  (FR,IS),(FR,FA),(FR,NE),(IS,FA),(IS,NE)and(FA,NE) .(FR,NE),(IS,FA),(IS,NE)\nare not a members of L2. It is not a frequent item set. Therefore, remove (FR, IS, FA, NE) from C3.\n These item sets are pruned according to pruning property because its item sets are not frequent ,C3 is null, so final frequent item set is L2.If the minimum confidence is 50% then Confidence (FA->FR) and Confidence (NE->FA) is maximum so these are the frequent item sets (shown in table 3.22).\nFigure 3.22: Analysis chart that shows different advertisement methods(answered given in questionnaires)\n0 50\n100\n150 200 250 300 350\nFriends Family Internet Search Online Advertising\nNewspaper Others\nTable 3.21: Frequent item set L2\nCode Support Count\nConfidence\nFRFA 10 0.59(59%) FRIS 6 0.25(25%) FANE 7 0.875(87%)\nTable 3.22: Frequent item sets\nCode Confidence FRFA 0.59(59%) FANE 0.875(87%)\nFigure 3.23: Analysis chart that shows different advertisement methods (according to data mining analysis)\n3.2.5 Conclusion This study looks for a better advertisement method. Fig.3.22 shows that most students have answered with friends (309 times) in the questionnaire but in this study data mining techniques are applied and this analysis concluded that the Family and Newspaper could be the best advertising method. Table 3.10 shows that most students have answered with friends (309 times) but with data mining technique’s analysis it is concluded that the Friends and Family, Family and Newspaper could be the best advertisement methods because these advertisement methods are linked with all advertisement methods. After applying apriori algorithm on the data set, Table 3.22 shows frequent item sets (FRFA,FANE) that concluded that Friends and Family, Family and Newspaper is the best advertisement methods. This study is helpful for educational institutes to making a good advertisement strategy that attracts student effectively.\n0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\n1\nFriends and Family Internet Search and\nFriends Online Advertising and Friends Newspaper and Friends Newspaper and Family Internet Search and Others\n3.3 Classification of Student’s data Using Data Mining Techniques for Training & Placement Purpose. Data Mining is new approach for technical education. Technical institute like engineering & other can use data mining techniques for analysis of different performances in student’s qualifications. In our work, we collected enrolled student’s data from engineering institute that have different information like 10th, 12th, B.tech passing percentage and then apply decision tree method for classifying students academics performance for Training & placement department can be identify the final grade of student for placement purpose. In future this study will be help to develop new approaches of data mining techniques in technical education. 3.3.1 Data Used\nTable 3.23: Student Attribute Description\nAttribute Possible Values Branch CS/IT 10th Per { First > 60%,Second > 45 & < 60 %,Third > 35 & < 45 % } 12th Per { First > 60%,Second > 45 & < 60 %,Third > 35 & < 45 % } B.Tech Per { First > 60%,Second > 45 & < 60 %,Third > 35 & < 45 % } Final Grade { Excellent, Good, Average }\n3.3.2 Classification Rules IF 10th % =“First” AND 12th % =“First” AND B.Tech % = “First” THEN Final_Grade = “Excellent” IF 10th % =“Second” AND 12th % =“First” AND B.Tech % = “First” THEN Final_Grade = “Good” IF 10th % =“Third” AND 12th % =“First” AND B.Tech % =“First” THEN Final_Grade = “Average” IF 10th % =“First” AND 12th % =“Second” AND B.Tech % =“First” THEN Final_Grade = “Good” IF 10th % =“Second” AND 12th % =“Second”AND B.Tech %= “First” THEN Final_Grade = “Average” IF 10th % =“Third” AND 12th % =“Second” AND B.Tech %= “First” THEN Final_Grade = “Average” IF 10th % =“First” AND 12th % =“First” AND B.Tech % =“Second” THEN Final_Grade = “Average” IF 10th % =“Second” AND 12th % =“First” AND B.Tech % =“Second” THEN Final_Grade = “Average”\nIF 10th % =“Third” AND 12th % =“First” AND B.Tech % =“Second” THEN Final_Grade = “Average” IF 10th % =“First” AND 12th % =“Second” AND B.Tech % =“Second” THEN Final_Grade = “Average” IF 10th % =“Second” AND 12th % =“Second”AND B.Tech %= “Second” THEN Final_Grade = “Average” 3.3.3 Conclusion & Future Work In this work we make use of data mining process in a student’s database using classification data mining techniques (decision tree method). The information generated after the analysis of data mining techniques on student’s data base is helpful for executives for training & placement department of engineering colleges. This work classifies the categories of student’s performance in their academic qualifications. For future work, this study will be helpful for institutions and industries. We can be generating the information after implementing the others data mining techniques like clustering, Predication and Association rules etc on different eligibility criteria of industry recruitment for students.\nCHAPTER 4 REFERENCES\n[1] C.
