      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Deep networks have recently exhibited state-of-the-art performance in computer vision tasks such as image classification and object detection (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014; Szegedy et al., 2014). However, top-performing systems usually involve very wide and deep networks, with numerous parameters. Once learned, a major drawback of such wide and deep models is that they result in very time consuming systems at inference time, since they need to perform a huge number of multiplications. Moreover, having large amounts of parameters makes the models high memory demanding. For these reasons, wide and deep top-performing networks are not well suited for applications with memory or time limitations.\nThere have been several attempts in the literature to tackle the problem of model compression to reduce the computational burden at inference time. In Bucila et al. (2006), authors propose to train a neural network to mimic the output of a complex and large ensemble. The method uses the ensemble to label unlabeled data and trains the neural network with the data labeled by the ensemble, thus mimicking the function learned by the ensemble and achieving similar accuracy. The idea has been recently adopted in Ba & Caruana (2014) to compress deep and wide networks into shallower but even wider ones, where the compressed model mimics the function learned by the complex model, in this case, by using data labeled by a deep (or an ensemble of deep) networks. More recently, Knowledge Distillation (KD) (Hinton & Dean, 2014) was introduced as a model compression framework, which eases the training of deep networks by following a student-teacher paradigm, in which the student is penalized according to a softened version of the teacher’s output. The framework compresses an ensemble of deep networks (teacher) into a student network of similar depth. To do so, the student is trained to predict the output of the teacher, as well as the true classification labels. All previous works focus on compressing a teacher network or an ensemble of networks into either networks of similar width and depth or into shallower and wider ones; not taking advantage of depth.\nDepth is a fundamental aspect of representation learning, since it encourages the re-use of features, and leads to more abstract and invariant representations at higher layers (Bengio et al., 2013). The\nimportance of depth has been verified (1) theoretically: deep representations are exponentially more expressive than shallow ones for some families of functions (Montufar et al., 2014); and (2) empirically: the two top-performers of ImageNet use deep convolutional networks with 19 and 22 layers, respectively (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) and (Szegedy et al., 2014).\nNevertheless, training deep architectures has proven to be challenging (Larochelle et al., 2007; Erhan et al., 2009), since they are composed of successive non-linearities and, thus result in highly non-convex and non-linear functions. Significant effort has been devoted to alleviate this optimization problem. On the one hand, pre-training strategies, whether unsupervised (Hinton et al., 2006; Bengio et al., 2007) or supervised (Bengio et al., 2007) train the network parameters in a greedy layerwise fashion in order to initialize the network parameters in a potentially good basin of attraction. The layers are trained one after the other according to an intermediate target. Similarly, semisupervised embedding (Weston et al., 2008) provides guidance to an intermediate layer to help learn very deep networks. More recently, (Chen-Yu et al., 2014; Szegedy et al., 2014; Gulcehre & Bengio, 2013) showed that adding supervision to intermediate layers of deep architectures assists the training of deep networks. Supervision is introduced by stacking a supervised MLP with a softmax layer on top of intermediate hidden layers to ensure their discriminability w.r.t. labels. Alternatively, Curriculum Learning strategies (CL) (Bengio, 2009) tackle the optimization problem by modifying the training distribution, such that the learner network gradually receives examples of increasing and appropriate difficulty w.r.t. the already learned concepts. As a result, curriculum learning acts like a continuation method, speeds up the convergence of the training process and finds potentially better local minima of highly non-convex cost functions.\nIn this paper, we aim to address the network compression problem by taking advantage of depth. We propose a novel approach to train thin and deep networks, called FitNets, to compress wide and shallower (but still deep) networks. The method is rooted in the recently proposed Knowledge Distillation (KD) (Hinton & Dean, 2014) and extends the idea to allow for thinner and deeper student models. We introduce intermediate-level hints from the teacher hidden layers to guide the training process of the student, i.e., we want the student network (FitNet) to learn an intermediate representation that is predictive of the intermediate representations of the teacher network. Hints allow the training of thinner and deeper networks. Results confirm that having deeper models allow us to generalize better, whereas making these models thin help us reduce the computational burden significantly. We validate the proposed method on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN and AFLW benchmark datasets and provide evidence that our method matches or outperforms the teacher’s performance, while requiring notably fewer parameters and multiplications."

      "heading" : "2.1 REVIEW OF KNOWLEDGE DISTILLATION",
      "text" : "In order to obtain a faster inference, we explore the recently proposed compression framework (Hinton & Dean, 2014), which trains a student network, from the softened output of an ensemble of wider networks, teacher network. The idea is to allow the student network to capture not only the information provided by the true labels, but also the finer structure learned by the teacher network. The framework can be summarized as follows.\nLet T be a teacher network with an output softmax PT = softmax(aT ) where aT is the vector of teacher pre-softmax activations, for some example. In the case where the teacher model is a single network, aT represents the weighted sums of the output layer, whereas if the teacher model is the result of an ensemble either PT or aT are obtained by averaging outputs from different networks (respectively for arithmetic or geometric averaging). Let S be a student network with parameters WS and output probability PS = softmax(aS), where aS is the student’s pre-softmax output. The student network will be trained such that its output PS is similar to the teacher’s output PT, as well as to the true labels ytrue. Since PT might be very close to the one hot code representation of the sample’s true label, a relaxation τ > 1 is introduced to soften the signal arising from the output\nof the teacher network, and thus, provide more information during training1. The same relaxation is applied to the output of the student network (Pτ\nS ), when it is compared to the teacher’s softened\noutput (Pτ T ):\nPτT = softmax (aT\nτ\n) , PτS = softmax (aS\nτ\n)\n. (1)\nThe student network is then trained to optimize the following loss function:\nLKD(WS) = H(ytrue,PS) + λH(P τ T,P τ S), (2)\nwhere H refers to the cross-entropy and λ is a tunable parameter to balance both cross-entropies. Note that the first term in Eq. (2) corresponds to the traditional cross-entropy between the output of a (student) network and labels, whereas the second term enforces the student network to learn from the softened output of the teacher network.\nTo the best of our knowledge, KD is designed such that student networks mimic teacher architectures of similar depth. Although we found the KD framework to achieve encouraging results even when student networks have slightly deeper architectures, as we increase the depth of the student network, KD training still suffers from the difficulty of optimizing deep nets (see Section 4.1)."

      "heading" : "2.2 HINT-BASED TRAINING",
      "text" : "In order to help the training of deep FitNets (deeper than their teacher), we introduce hints from the teacher network. A hint is defined as the output of a teacher’s hidden layer responsible for guiding the student’s learning process. Analogously, we choose a hidden layer of the FitNet, the guided layer, to learn from the teacher’s hint layer. We want the guided layer to be able to predict the output of the hint layer. Note that having hints is a form of regularization and thus, the pair hint/guided layer has to be chosen such that the student network is not over-regularized. The deeper we set the guided layer, the less flexibility we give to the network and, therefore, FitNets are more likely to suffer from over-regularization. In our case, we choose the hint to be the middle layer of the teacher network. Similarly, we choose the guided layer to be the middle layer of the student network.\nGiven that the teacher network will usually be wider than the FitNet, the selected hint layer may have more outputs than the guided layer. For that reason, we add a regressor to the guided layer, whose output matches the size of the hint layer. Then, we train the FitNet parameters from the first layer up to the guided layer as well as the regressor parameters by minimizing the following loss function:\nLHT (WGuided,Wr) = 1\n2 ||uh(x;WHint)− r(vg(x;WGuided);Wr)||\n2, (3)\nwhere uh and vg are the teacher/student deep nested functions up to their respective hint/guided layers with parameters WHint and WGuided, r is the regressor function on top of the guided layer with parameters Wr. Note that the outputs of uh and r have to be comparable, i.e., uh and r must be the same non-linearity.\nNevertheless, using a fully-connected regressor increases the number of parameters and the memory consumption dramatically in the case where the guided and hint layers are convolutional. Let Nh,1× Nh,2 and Oh be the teacher hint’s spatial size and number of channels, respectively. Similarity, let Ng,1×Ng,2 and Og be the FitNet guided layer’s spatial size and number of channels. The number of parameters in the weight matrix of a fully connected regressor is Nh,1×Nh,2×Oh×Ng,1×Ng,2×Og. To mitigate this limitation, we use a convolutional regressor instead. The convolutional regressor is designed such that it considers approximately the same spatial region of the input image as the teacher hint. Therefore, the output of the regressor has the same spatial size as the teacher hint. Given a teacher hint of spatial size Nh,1×Nh,2, the regressor takes the output of the Fitnet’s guided layer of size Ng,1 × Ng,2 and adapts its kernel shape k1 × k2 such that Ng,i − ki + 1 = Nh,i, where i ∈ {1, 2}. The number of parameters in the weight matrix of a the convolutional regressor is k1 × k2 ×Oh ×Og, where k1 × k2 is significantly lower than Nh,1 ×Nh,2 ×Ng,1 ×Ng,2.\n1For example, as argued by Hinton & Dean (2014), with softened outputs, more information is provided about the relative similarity of the input to classes other than the one with the highest probability."

      "heading" : "2.4 RELATION TO CURRICULUM LEARNING",
      "text" : "In this section, we argue that our hint-based training with KD can be seen as a particular form of Curriculum Learning (Bengio, 2009). Curriculum learning has proven to accelerate the training convergence as well as potentially improve the model generalization by properly choosing a sequence of training distributions seen by the learner: from simple examples to more complex ones. A curriculum learning extension (Gulcehre & Bengio, 2013) has also shown that by using guidance hints on an intermediate layer during the training, one could considerably ease training. However, Bengio (2009) uses hand-defined heuristics to measure the “simplicity” of an example in a sequence and Gulcehre & Bengio (2013)’s guidance hints require some prior knowledge of the end-task. Both of these curriculum learning strategies tend to be problem-specific.\nOur approach alleviates this issue by using a teacher model. Indeed, intermediate representations learned by the teacher are used as hints to guide the FitNet optimization procedure. In addition, the teacher confidence provides a measure of example “simplicity” by means of teacher cross-entropy term in Eq. (2). This term ensures that examples with a high teacher confidence have a stronger impact than examples with low teacher confidence: the latter correspond to probabilities closer to the uniform distribution, which exert less of a push on the student parameters. In other words, the teacher penalizes the training examples according to its confidence. Note that parameter λ in Eq.\n(2) controls the weight given to the teacher cross-entropy, and thus, the importance given to each example. In order to promote the learning of more complex examples (examples with lower teacher confidence), we gradually anneal λ during the training with a linear decay. The curriculum can be seen as composed of two stages: first learn intermediate concepts via the hint/guided layer transfer, then train the whole student network jointly, annealing λ, which allows easier examples (on which the teacher is very confident) to initially have a stronger effect, but progressively decreasing their importance as λ decays. Therefore, the hint-based training introduced in the paper is a generic curriculum learning approach, where prior information about the task-at-hand is deduced purely from the teacher model.\nAlgorithm # params Accuracy Compression\nFitNet 2.5M 91.61% Teacher 9M 90.18%\nMimic single 54M 84.6% Mimic single 70M 84.9%\nMimic ensemble 70M 85.8% State-of-the-art methods Maxout 90.65% Network in Network 91.2% Deeply-Supervised Networks 91.78%\nTable 1: Accuracy on CIFAR-10\nAlgorithm # params Accuracy Compression\nFitNet 2.5M 64.96% Teacher 9M 63.54%\nState-of-the-art methods Maxout 61.43% Network in Network 64.32% Deeply-Supervised Networks 65.43%\nTable 2: Accuracy on CIFAR-100"

Similarly, we extracted 25K 16x16 pixels patches not containing faces from ImageNet (Russakovsky et al., 2014) dataset, as negative samples. We used 90% of the extracted patches to train the network.\nIn this experiment, we aimed to evaluate the method on a different kind of architecture.

We consider two computational budgets of approximately 30M and 107M operations, corresponding to the multiplications needed in an image forward propagation. For each computational budget, we train networks composed of 3, 5, 7 and 9 convolutional layers, followed by a fully-connected layer and a softmax layer. We compare their performances when they are trained with standard backpropagation, KD and HT. Figure 2 reports test on CIFAR-10 using early stopping on the validation set, i.e. we do not retrain our models on the training plus validation sets.\nDue to their depth and small capacity, FitNets are hard to train. As shown in Figure 2(a), we could not train 30M multiplications networks with more than 5 layers with standard backprop. When using KD, we succesfully trained networks up to 7 layers. Adding KD’s teacher cross-entropy to the training objective (Eq. (2)) gives more importance to easier examples, i.e. samples for which the teacher network is confident and, can lead to a smoother version of the training cost (Bengio, 2009). Despite some optimization benefits, it is worth noticing that KD training still suffers from the increasing depth and reaches its limits for 7-layer networks. HT tends to ease these optimization issues and is able to train 13-layer networks of 30M multiplications. The only difference between HT and KD is the starting point in the parameter space: either random or obtained by means of the teacher’s hint. On the one hand, the proliferation of local minima and especially saddle points in highly non-linear functions such as very deep networks highlights the difficulty of finding a good starting point in the parameter space at random (Dauphin et al., 2014). On the other hand, results in Figure 2(a) indicate that HT can guide the student to a better initial position in the parameter space, from which we can minimize the cost through stochastic gradient descent. Therefore, HT provides benefits from an optimization point of view. Networks trained with HT also tend to yield better test performances than the other training methods when we fix the capacity and number of layers. For instance, in Figure 2(b), the 7-layers network, trained with hints, obtains a +0.7% performance gain on the test set compared to the model that does not use any hints (the accuracy increases from 89.45% to 90.1%). As pointed by Erhan et al. (2009), pre-training strategies can act as regularizers. These results suggest that HT is a stronger regularizer than KD, since it leads to better generalization\nperformance on the test set. Finally, Figure 2 highlights that deep models have better performances than shallower ones given a fixed computational budget. Indeed, considering networks that are trained with hints, an 11-layer network outperforms a 5-layer network by an absolute improvement of 4.11% for 107M multiplications and of 3.4% for 30M multiplications. Therefore, the experiments validate our hypothesis that given a fixed number of computations, we leverage depth in a model to achieve faster computation and better generalization.\nIn summary, this experiment shows that (1) using HT, we are able to train deeper models than with standard back-propagation and KD; and (2) given a fixed capacity, deeper models performed better than shallower ones."

For comparison with state-of-art methods, we used FitNet 4 architecture in Table 7.\nRMSProp (Tieleman & Hinton, 2012) was used for training the FitNets with an initial learning rate the learning of 0.0005. Parameter λ in Eq. (2) was initialized to 4 and decayed linearly during 500 epochs reaching λ = 1.\nOn CIFAR-10, we divide the training set in 40K train examples and 10K valid examples. We train the hints by minimizing Eq. (3) and stop when we monitor no improvement on the validation error during 100 epochs. After that, we trained the whole student network by minimizing Eq. (2) using RMSprop and the same stopping criteria. After determining the optimal hyper-parameter on the validation set, we retrained on the whole 50K (train and validation sets). On CIFAR-100, we train directly on the whole training set using the hyper-parameters that showed good performance on CIFAR-10.\nA.2 MNIST\nIn this section, we describe the Teacher and FitNet architectures used in the MNIST experiments.\nWe trained a teacher network of maxout convolutional layers as reported in Goodfellow et al. (2013b). The teacher architecture has three convolutional maxout hidden layers (with 2 linear pieces each) of 48-48-24 units, respectively, followed by a spatial max-pooling of 4x4-4x4-2x2 pixels, with an overlap of 2x2 pixels. The 3rd hidden layer is followed by a fully-connected softmax layer. As is Goodfellow et al. (2013b), we added zero padding to the second convolutional layer.\nWe designed a FitNet twice as deep as the teacher network and with roughly 8% of the parameters. The student architecture has 6 maxout convolutional hidden layers (with 2 linear pieces each) of 16-16-16-16-12-12 units, respectively. Max-pooling is only applied every second layer in regions of 4x4-4x4-2x2 pixels, with an overlap of 2x2 pixels. The 6th convolutional hidden layer is followed by a fully-connected softmax layer.\nThe teacher network was trained as described in Goodfellow et al. (2013b). The FitNet was trained in a stage-wise fashion as described in Section 2. We divided the training set into a training set of 50K samples and a validation set of 10K samples. In the first stage, the 4th layer of the FitNet was trained to mimic the 2nd layer of the teacher network, by minimizing Eq. (3) through stochastic gradient descent. We used a mini-batch size of 128 samples and fixed the learning rate to 0.0005. We initialized λ to 4 and decayed it for the first 150 epochs until it reached 1. The training was stopped after 100 epochs of no validation error progress. We used the same mini-batch size, learning rate and stopping criterion to train the second stage. The relaxation term τ was set to 3.\nA.3 SVHN\nFor SVHN, we also used a maxout convolutional Teacher composed of 3 convolutional hidden layers of 64-128-128 units. A a fully-connected maxout layer of 400 units and a softmax layer are used as top-layers. Teacher training is carried out the same way than Goodfellow et al. (2013b). As FitNet, we used the FitNet 4 architecture specified in Table 7. FitNet training follows the same protocol than CIFAR-10 with early stopping based on a validation set, except that we do not retrain our FitNet on both train and validation sets.\nA.4 AFLW\nIn this section, we describe the Teacher and FitNet architectures used in the AFLW experiments.\nWe trained a teacher network of 3 ReLU convolutional layers of 128-512-512 units, respectively, followed by a sigmoid layer. Non-overlapping max-pooling of size 2 × 2 was performed after the first convolutional layer. We used receptive fields of 3-2-5 for each layer, respectively.\nWe designed two FitNets of 7 ReLU convolutional layers. Fitnet 1’s layers have 16-32-32-32-32- 32-32-32 units, respectively, followed by a sigmoid layer. Fitnet 2’s layers have 32-64-64-64-64- 64-64-64 units, respectively, followed by a sigmoid layer. In both cases, we used receptive fields of 3× 3 and, due to the really small image resolution, we did not perform any max-pooling.\nWe used a mini-batch size of 128 samples and initialized the learning rate to 0.001 and decayed it for the first 100 epochs until reaching 0.01. We also used momentum. We initialized momentum to 0.7 and saturated it to 0.9 at epoch 100. We picked the best validation value after a 500 epochs.\nBoth FitNets were trained in a stage-wise fashion as described in Section 2. We used 90% of the data for training. In the first stage, the 5th layer of the FitNets were trained to mimic the 3rd layer of the teacher network, by minimizing Eq. (3) through stochastic gradient descent. We used a minibatch size of 128 samples and initialized the learning rate to 0.001 and decayed it for the first 100 epochs until reaching 0.01. We also used momentum. We initialized momentum to 0.1 and saturated it to 0.9 at epoch 100. We picked the best validation value after a 500 epochs. We used the same mini-batch size, learning rate and stopping criterion to train the second stage. The relaxation term τ was set to 3."

Despite some optimization benefits, it is worth noticing that KD training still suffers from the increasing depth and reaches its limits for 7-layer networks. HT tends to ease these optimization issues and is able to train 13-layer networks of 30M multiplications. The only difference between HT and KD is the starting point in the parameter space: either random or obtained by means of the teacher’s hint. On the one hand, the proliferation of local minima and especially saddle points in highly non-linear functions such as very deep networks highlights the difficulty of finding a good starting point in the parameter space at random (Dauphin et al., 2014). On the other hand, results in Figure 2(a) indicate that HT can guide the student to a better initial position in the parameter space, from which we can minimize the cost through stochastic gradient descent. Therefore, HT provides benefits from an optimization point of view. Networks trained with HT also tend to yield better test performances than the other training methods when we fix the capacity and number of layers. For instance, in Figure 2(b), the 7-layers network, trained with hints, obtains a +0.7% performance gain on the test set compared to the model that does not use any hints (the accuracy increases from 89.45% to 90.1%). As pointed by Erhan et al. (2009), pre-training strategies can act as regularizers.",

    "abstractText" : "While depth tends to improve network performances, it also makes gradient-based training more difficult since deeper networks tend to be more non-linear. The recently proposed knowledge distillation approach is aimed at obtaining small and fast-to-execute models, and it has shown that a student network could imitate the soft output of a larger teacher network or ensemble of networks. In this paper, we extend this idea to allow the training of a student that is deeper and thinner than the teacher, using not only the outputs but also the intermediate representations learned by the teacher as hints to improve the training process and final performance of the student. Because the student intermediate hidden layer will generally be smaller than the teacher’s intermediate hidden layer, additional parameters are introduced to map the student hidden layer to the prediction of the teacher hidden layer. This allows one to train deeper students that can generalize better or run faster, a trade-off that is controlled by the chosen student capacity. For example, on CIFAR-10, a deep student network with almost 10.4 times less parameters outperforms a larger, state-of-the-art teacher network.",
