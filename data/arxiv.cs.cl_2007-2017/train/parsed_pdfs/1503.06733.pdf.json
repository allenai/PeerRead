      "text" : "many important applications in downstream tasks such as information retrieval, machine translation and knowledge acquisition. We introduce the Yara Parser, a fast and accurate open-source dependency parser based on the arc-eager algorithm and beam search. It achieves an unlabeled accuracy of 93.32 on the standard WSJ test set which ranks it among the top dependency parsers. At its fastest, Yara can parse about 4000 sentences per second when in greedy mode (1 beam). When optimizing for accuracy (using 64 beams and Brown cluster features), Yara can parse 45 sentences per second. The parser can be trained on any syntactic dependency treebank and different options are provided in order to make it more flexible and tunable for specific tasks. It is released with the Apache version 2.0 license and can be used for both commercial and academic purposes. The parser can be found at https: //github.com/yahoo/YaraParser.\nContents"

      "text" : "Dependency trees are one of the main representations used in the syntactic analysis of sentences. They show explicit syntactic dependencies among words in the sentence [Kübler et al., 2009]. Many dependency parsers have been released in the past decade. Among them, graph-based and transition-based parsing are two main approaches towards dependency parsing. In graph-based models, the parser aims to find the most likely tree from all possible trees by using maximum spanning tree algorithms often in conjunction with dynamic programming. On the other hand, in transition-based models, a tree is converted to a set of incremental actions and the parser decides to commit an action depending on the current configuration of the partial tree. Graph-based parsers can achieve state-of-the-art performance with the guarantee of recovering the best possible parse, but usually at the expense of speed. On the other hand, transition-based parsers are fast because the parser can greedily choose an action in each configuration and thus it can use arbitrary non-local features to compensate the lack of optimality. Also, it is easy to augment the set of actions to extend the functionality of the parser on such tasks as disfluency detection [Rasooli and Tetreault, 2013, Rasooli and Tetreault, 2014, Honnibal and Johnson, 2014] and punctuation prediction [Zhang et al., 2013a]. They are mostly used in supervised tasks but in rare cases they are also used in unsupervised tasks either with little manual linguistic knowledge or with no prior knowledge [Daumé III, 2009, Rasooli and Faili, 2012].\nIn this report, we provide a brief introduction to our newly released dependency parser. We show that it can achieve a very high accuracy on the standard English WSJ test set and show that it is very fast even in its slowest mode while getting results very close to state-of-the-art. The structure of this report is as follows: in §2 we provide some details about using Yara both in command line and as an API. We provide technical details about it in §3 and experiments are conducted in §4. Finally we conclude in §5."

The features of the parser are roughly the same as [Zhang and Nivre, 2011] with additional Brown clustering [Brown et al., 1992] features.7 Yara also includes several flexible parameters and options to allow users to easily tune it depending on the language and task. Generally speaking, there are 128 possible combinations of the settings in addition to tuning the number of iterations, Brown clustering features and beam width.8"

      "heading" : "3.1 Arc-Eager Algorithm",
      "text" : "As in the arc-eager algorithm, Yara has the following actions:\n• Left-arc (LA): The first word in the buffer becomes the head of the top word in the stack. The top word is popped after this action.\n• Right-arc (RA): The top word in the stack becomes the head of the first word in the buffer. • Reduce (R): The top word in the stack is popped. • Shift (SH): The first word in the buffer is pushed to the stack.\nDepending on position of the root, the constraints for initialization and actions differ. Figure 2 shows the transitions used to parse the sentence \"I want to parse a sentence .\".\nUnshift Action The original algorithm is not guaranteed to output a tree and thus in some occasions when the root is positioned in the beginning of the sentence, the parser decides to connect all remaining words in the stack to the root token. In [Nivre and Fernández-González, 2014], a new action and empty flag is introduced to compensate for this problem and preserve the tree constraint. The action is called unshift which pops the first word in the stack and returns it to the start position of the buffer. We also added the “unshift” action for the cases where the root token is in the initial position of the sentence. This makes the parser more robust and gives a slight boost in performance.9"

We use different\n7The idea of using Brown clustering features is inspired from [Koo et al., 2008, Honnibal and Johnson, 2014]. 8We put the best performing setting as the default setting for Yara. 9This problem happens less in the case of beam search and it is more often in greedy parsing.\nengineering methods to speed up the parser, such as the averaging trick introduced by [Daumé III, 2006,\nFigure 2.3]. Furthermore, all the features except label set-lexical pair features are converted to long integer values to prevent frequent hash collisions and decrease memory consumption. Semi-sparse weight vectors are used for additional speed up, though it comes with an increase in memory consumption. The details of this implementation are out of the scope of this report."

      "heading" : "3.3 Beam Search and Update Methods",
      "text" : "Early transition-based parsers such as the Malt parser [Nivre et al., 2006] were greedy and trained in batch mode. This was done by converting each tree to a set of independent actions. This has been shown to be less effective than a global search. Given our feature setting, it is impossible to use dynamic programming to get the exact result. We instead use beam search as an approximation.10 Therefore, unlike batch learning, the same procedure is used for training and decoding the parser. Yara supports beam search and its default beam size is 64.\nThere are several ways to update the classifier weights with beam learning. A very trivial way is to get the best scoring result from beam search as the prediction and update the weights compared to the gold. This is known as “late update” but it does not lead to a good performance [Huang et al., 2012]. A more appealing way is to keep searching until the gold prediction goes out of the beam or the search reaches the end state. This is known as \"early update\" [Collins and Roark, 2004] and studies have shown a boost in performance relative to late update [Collins and Roark, 2004, Zhang and Clark, 2008]. The main problem with early update is that it does not update the weights according to the maximally violated prediction. A \"max-violation\" is a state in the beam where the gold standard is out of the beam and the gap in the score of the gold prediction and best scoring beam item is maximum. With max-violation update [Huang et al., 2012], the learner updates the weights according to the max-violation state. In other words, max-violation is the worst mistake that the classifier makes in the beam compared to the gold action. Yara supports both early and max-violation update while Zpar [Zhang and Nivre, 2011] only supports early update and RedShift [Honnibal and Johnson, 2014] only supports max-violation. Its default value for the update model is max-violation."

      "heading" : "3.4 Dynamic and Static Oracles",
      "text" : "With the standard transition-based parsing algorithms, it is possible to have a parse tree with different action sequences. In other words, different search paths may lead to the same parse tree. Most of the off-the-shelf parsers such as Zpar [Zhang and Nivre, 2011] define some manual rules for recovering a gold oracle to give it to the learner. This is known as a static oracle. The other way is to allow the oracle to be dynamic and let the learner choose from the oracles [Goldberg and Nivre, 2013]. Yara supports both static and dynamic oracles. In the case of dynamic oracles, only zero-cost explorations are allowed. In [Goldberg and Nivre, 2013], the gold oracle can be chosen randomly but we also provided another option to choose the best scoring oracle as the selected oracle. The latter way is known as latent structured Perceptron [Sun et al., 2013] by supposing the gold tree as the structure and each oracle as a latent path for reaching the final structure. Our experiments show that using the highest scoring oracle gives slightly better results and thus we let it be the default option in the parser training."

We allow the root to be either in the initial or final position in the sentence. The final position is the default option for Yara parser.\nFeatures We use roughly the same feature set as [Zhang and Nivre, 2011]. The extended feature set is the default but the user can use the basic option to set it to basic set of local features to improve speed with a loss in accuracy. We also add extra features from Brown word clusters [Brown et al., 1992], as used in [Koo et al., 2008], by using the Brown clusters for the first word in the buffer and stack, the prefixes of length 4 and 6 from the cluster bit string in the place of part of speech tags and the full bit string of the cluster in the place of words. When using all the features, we get a boost in performance but at the expense of speed.\n10Greedy search can be viewed as beam search with a beam size of one.\nUnlabeled Parsing Although the parser is designed for labeled parsing, unlabeled parsing is also available through command line options. This is useful for the cases where the user simply needs a very fast parser and does not care about the loss in performance or the lack of label information.\nPartial Parsing There are some occasions especially in semi-supervised parsing, where we have partial information about the tree, for example, we know that the third word is the subject of the first word. With partial parsing, we let the user benefit from dynamic oracles to parse partial trees such that known arcs are preserved unless the tree constraints cannot be satisfied.\nMultithreading Given the fact that current systems have multiple processing unit cores and many of those cores, support hyper-threading, we added the support for multithreading. When dealing with a file, the parser does multithreaded parsing on the sentence level (i.e. parsing sentences in parallel but outputting them in the same order given in the input). When using the API, it is possible to use multithreading at the beam-level. Beam level multithreading is slower than sentence-level multithreading. We also use beam-level multi-threading for training the parser and this significantly speeds up the training phase. Yara’s default is set to 8 threads but the user can easily change it.\nModel Selection Unlike most current parsers, Yara saves the model file for all training iterations and lets the user choose the best performing model based on the performance on the development data. It also reports the performance on the development data to make it easier for the users to select the best model.\nTree Scoring Yara also has the option to output the parse score to a text file. The score is the perceptron score divided by the sentence length.\nLowercasing In cases, such as spoken lanuage parsing, no casing is provided and it is better to train on lowercased text. Yara has this option with the argument lowercase in training."

      "text" : "In this section we show how Yara performs on two different data sets and compare its performance to other leading parsers. We also graphically depict the tradeoff between beam width and accuracy and number of iterations. For all experiments we use version 0.2 of Yara."

      "heading" : "4.1 Parsing WSJ Data",
      "text" : "We use the the traditional WSJ train-dev-test split for our experiment. As in [Zhang and Nivre, 2011], we first converted the WSJ data [Marcus et al., 1993] with Penn2Malt11. Next, automatic POS tags are generated for the whole dataset with version 0.2 of our POS tagger12 by doing 10-way jack-knifing on the training data. The tagger is a 20-beam third-order tagger trained with the maximum violation strategy with the same settings as in [Collins, 2002], along with additional Brown clustering features [Liang, 2005].13 It achieved a POS tagging accuracy of 97.14, 97.18 and 97.37 on the train, development and test files respectively.\nTable 1 shows the results on WSJ data by varying beam size and the use of Brown clusters. A comparison with prior art is made in Table 2. All unlabeled accuracy scores (UAS) and labeled accuracy scores (LAS) are calculated with punctuations ignored. As seen in Table 1, Yara’s accuracy is very close to the state-of-the-art [Bohnet and Nivre, 2012].\nEffect of Beam Size Choosing a reasonable beam size is essential in certain NLP applications as there is always a trade-off between speed and performance. As shown in Figure 3, after a beam size of eight, the performance results do not change as much as the performance gap in for example beam of size one compared to beam of size two. This is useful because when changing the beam size from 64 to 8, one may speed up parsing by a factor of three (as shown in Table 3) with a small relative loss in performance.\n11stp.lingfil.uu.se/~nivre/research/Penn2Malt.html 12https://github.com/rasoolims/SemiSupervisedPosTagger. 13We use the pre-built Brown cluster features in http://metaoptimize.com/projects/wordreprs/ with 1000 word\nclasses."

We use version 1.1 of the Persian dependency treebank (PerDT) [Rasooli et al., 2013]14 and tagged it with the same setting as WSJ data. We tokenized Mizan corpus15 and add it to our training data to create 1000 Brown clusters.16 The training data contains 22% nonprojective trees. We use Mate parser (v3.6.1) [Bohnet, 2010] as a highly accurate non-projective parsing tool to compare with Yara. Table 4 shows the performance for the two parsers. There is a 1.35% gap in\n14http://www.dadegan.ir/catalog/perdt 15http://www.dadegan.ir/catalog/mizan 16The definition of Brown cluster in this data is loose because there are multi-word verbs in the treebank while Brown clusters are acquired from training on single words. Therefore multi-word verbs in the treebank will not get any Brown cluster assignment and thus we will have a slight loss in performance.\nunlabeled accuracy but given that 22% of the trees (∼2.5% of the arcs) are non-projective, this gap is reasonable."

This parser can also be used for non-projective languages with a very slight loss in performance.

Our future plans include extending this parser to handle non-projectivity and also use continuous value representation features such as word embeddings to improve the accuracy of the parser."

It achieves an unlabeled accuracy of 93.32 on the standard WSJ test set which ranks it among the top dependency parsers. At its fastest, Yara can parse about 4000 sentences per second when in greedy mode (1 beam). When optimizing for accuracy (using 64 beams and Brown cluster features), Yara can parse 45 sentences per second. The parser can be trained on any syntactic dependency treebank and different options are provided in order to make it more flexible and tunable for specific tasks. It is released with the Apache version 2.0 license and can be used for both commercial and academic purposes. The parser can be found at https: //github.com/yahoo/YaraParser.",
