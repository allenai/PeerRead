      "text" : "Consider what the eyes are doing when involved in the solving of a jigsaw puzzle. While the mind is darting about, imagining placement possibilities, considering combinations, and pondering strategies, the eyes too are darting from place to place over the puzzle, examining pieces relevant to a considered placement, checking edges for compatibility, and studying the layout. The eyes are responding to the deliberation of the mind, checking expectations and seeking out necessary information. They are assuring that the deliberation is rooted in the physical reality of the problem.\nMany problems in robot manipulation require deliberation because of the large number of elements involved and their complicated interactions. It should be expected that in such problems a similar integration of deliberation with perception (and geometric reasoning) would be measurably beneficial, considering its apparent interleaving in human problem solving. Consider, for instance, moving objects around from one location to another on a workspace. These movements must take into account (1) whether some objects block the reachability of another object at a particular location, and (2) whether an object can be placed on top of another object while maintaining the stability of the stack of objects. To check the two conditions above, perception can be useful in identifying the orientation and shape of the object; in this way, perception can guide planning towards feasible plans.\nAlternatively, planning may guide perception: rather than obtaining the details of all the objects in the scene, their shapes and so forth, planning may\nar X\niv :1\n30 7.\n74 66\nv1 [\ncs .A\nI] 2\n9 Ju\nl 2 01\nask for the information about the relevant objects thus reducing the amount of computation for perception, and may further reduce the amount of perceptual knowledge needed to be considered by the planning. Such a top-down guidance of perception can be considered a rudimentary attentional mechanism.\nIn this paper, we investigate the usefulness of three different approaches to integrating perception with planning, in a similar way to Schüller et al. 2013 [1] who investigate integration of planning with geometric reasoning. The three approaches investigated are (Pre) preprocessing of perceptual data and its integration into the action domain, (Filt) filtering of plans by post-checking using perceptual processing, and (Repl) derivation of additional constraints from perception for subsequent replanning.\nIn the current work we describe experiments in a robotic manipulation domain with various industrially plausible objects used at the 2012 RoboCup@Work competition (Figure 1).\nAs with Erdem et al. 2011 [2], we describe the manipulation domain in the action language C+ [3], and use the reasoning system CCalc [4] to solve planning problems. We use an object segmentation and shape recognition system built on the Kinect RGBD (RGB plus depth) camera and Point Cloud Library [5]. Perceptual processing does a quick initial bottom-up run, finding candidate objects in the target scene, and subsequently provides information about the shape of these objects to the planner on demand."

      "text" : "Various planning techniques have been used for efficient visual processing management in earlier studies [6,7,8,9]. A survey of such works can be found in the context of the recent introduction of planning for perception in the context of cognitive robotics [10]. The current report distinguishes itself in that it is an empirical investigation of embedding of perceptual processing into a task planning problem, rather than an application of planning to perceptual processing and also aims to investigate how this integration might also improve efficiency of planning. In that sense, a more relevant related work reports a Prolog-based decision making system that utilizes external computations for generating and\nevaluating perceptual hypotheses, such as the missing objects on a table [11], though it should be emphasized that the current report is an empirical investigation of different ways of embedding such external computations."

      "heading" : "3 Manipulation Domain Description",
      "text" : "The robotic manipulation domain we consider in our experiments involves robot grasping, transport and placement of objects from a small set of industrially plausible objects (Figure 1) used at the Robocup@Work 2012 competition. The planning problem is to obtain a sequence of actions that transforms an initial configuration of these objects on a work area into a final configuration that satisfies some goal conditions. Perception is utilized in identifying the shape of objects to check the stability of stacks of objects and also their reachability.\nIn this work, to emphasize the integration of perception with planning, unlike at Robocup@Work 2012, the mobile aspect of the robot is not addressed.\nWe view the work area as a 5×3 grid, where each grid cell has a unique label. We assume that the objects are oriented in three different ways: horizontal to the x axis, horizontal to the y axis, or vertical with respect to the work area. Objects can be placed on top of each other or on the work area.\nWe describe this domain in the action language C+ [3] as follows. States of the world are described by means of two fluents (i.e., atoms whose truth value may change over time): one describing the locations loc of objects obj on the work area or on other objects (is at(obj) = loc), and the other describing their orientations orient (ori is(obj) = orient).\nWe represent an action of the robot moving an object obj to a location loc with an orientation orient by atoms of the form move(obj, loc, orient). This action involves both a pick of the object and its placement. In the following, obj, obj′ range over objects, loc ranges over locations on the work area (i.e., grid cells or other objects), and orient, orient′ ranges over the three possible orientations of objects."

      "heading" : "3.1 Effects and preconditions of actions",
      "text" : "The direct effects of the move action are described in C+ by the following causal laws:\nmove(obj, loc, orient) causes is at(obj) = loc move(obj, loc, orient) causes ori is(obj) = orient\nThe preconditions of this action are described by causal laws as well. For instance, we can represent that an object cannot be moved to a location if it is already there, by the causal law:\nnonexecutable move(obj, loc, orient) if is at(obj) = loc\nThe precomputation (Pre) approach to integration also makes use of causal laws as a way of integrating external computation. The following causal law\nexpresses that an object cannot be moved on top of another object if that would lead to an unstable stack.\nnonexecutable move(obj, obj′, orient) if ori is(obj′) = orient′\n(where unstackable ext(obj, orient, obj′, orient′) holds)\nHere, the stability of a stack of objects is checked “externally” by the “external predicate” unstackable ext(obj, orient, obj′, orient′), which utilizes perception to obtain the shape of the object (though object shape is not represented at the high level) and then checks the stability of the stack with respect to some geometric constraints which depend on object shape. An external predicate is a predicate whose truth value is determined by running arbitrary computation, the details of which are not represented in the high-level formalism from which it is accessed. External predicates are similarly utilized by Erdem et al. 2011 [2] to embed geometric reasoning into preconditions of actions.\nSimilarly, reach blocked ext(obj, loc, orient, obj′, loc′, orient′), another external predicate, is used to determine whether an object obj above a particular table location loc and orientation orient will block a reach to a second object obj′ above a different table location loc′ and orientation orient′. This external predicate is used to forbid certain actions. In one case, if the object to be moved is currently blocked by another object, the move action is forbidden. In another, an object cannot be placed on an unreachable table location or on another object that is above an unreachable table location."

      "heading" : "4 Object Recognition",
      "text" : "Perceptual data comes in the form of a point cloud from a Kinect RGBD camera, which uses a structured infrared projector and camera to pick out dense depth as well as RGB images. The camera is mounted on the robot at an angle to gain a wide view of the workspace. The perceptual subsystem consists of two phases, the bottom-up and top-down phases.\nIn the first, bottom-up phase, candidate scene objects are segmented on the basis of disconnectedness in 3D space, and located with respect to a tabletop workspace. Orientation is determined by object principle extents. This requires a mapping of the perceptual data into the world coordinate system, using robot localization and calibration of sensor extrinsic parameters. The names of taskrelevant objects are given in the task specification and simple data association is performed based on Euclidean distance. Other objects have automatically generated names that are forwarded on to the task planner.\nThe second, top-down phase is the object recognition phase, where the perceptual component provides the shapes of objects on request. It uses a database of CAD-like models and associated reference point clouds, and the shape is maintained as an identifier mapping into this database. Further orientation refinement is possible after recognition. The recognition phase proceeds by matching a simple global object descriptor, calculated from colors and principle axes, between available 3D reference point clouds and candidate object point clouds. Local shape descriptors are also robustly matched: Fast Point Feature Histograms [12]. Both global and local features are used because the small size of target objects and the sensor’s distance from them make local features unreliable."

      "text" : "Pre: In the precomputation approach, first all possible external computations (i.e., stability and reachability checks) involving perceptual processing (i.e., identifying shapes of all objects) are completed, and then the results of these computations are represented by means of external predicates used in the domain description. After that, feasible plans are computed.\nFor instance, shape information and information about possible occlusions returned from the perceptual system can be represented as Prolog facts as follows:\nshape_is_ext(sco2,bolt_m20_100). is_in_front_ext(loc_0x0,loc_1x0).\nwhich then can be utilized in defining external predicates as follows:\nunstackable_ext(OBJ1,OBJ1_ORIENTATION,OBJ2,_):-\nshape_is_ext(OBJ2,aluprofil_f20_100_gray), OBJ1_ORIENTATION\\=vert, shape_is_ext(OBJ1,bolt_m20_100).\nreach_blocked_ext(OBJ1,LOC1,ORI1,_,LOC2,_):-\nis_in_front_ext(LOC1,LOC2), shape_is_ext(OBJ1,bolt_m20_100), ORI1=vert.\nThe first rule states that a bolt can’t be stacked horizontally on top of an aluminium profile and the second that a vertical bolt will block a reach to any object behind it.\nBecause object shape is constant across the time domain, we do not here consider perception to produce only initial state (initial locations and orientations), but also can be used in causal laws that apply at all time points."

      "heading" : "5.2 Filtering",
      "text" : "Filt: In the filtering approach, a plan is computed first using the domain description without the causal laws that depend on external predicates, and then stability and reachability checks are performed to identify the feasibility of the plan; if the plan is not feasible a different plan is computed. This three step procedure is executed in a loop until a feasible plan is computed. In the Filt condition, external checks are not integrated into the domain description as external predicates as is done in Pre but are instead used after planning to evaluate the correctness of planner output; i.e. they are not formally part of the domain description.\nExternal computations check plan feasibility as follows:\n– It is determined whether the computed plan attempts a stack, or a reach where an object may be blocking another. This provides a list of queries of one of the two forms: “Does putting the object obj at orientation orient on top of obj′ when it is at orientation orient′ make the objects unstable?” and “Does the object obj at orientation orient and table location loc block a reach action to the object obj′ when it is at orientation orient′ and table location loc′?”. Although not utilized in the domain theory, these queries have the same form as the external predicates referred to by the Pre method: The first\nquery has the form unstackable ext(obj, orient, obj′, orient′) and the second query has the form reach blocked ext(obj, loc, orient, obj′, loc′, orient′). – For each of these queries it is inferred which perceptual information is necessary to to answer it (it is determined for which objects to calculate shapes). The perception module is then queried for this information if it is not already cached. – The truth of the queries are ascertained with the new data. If no relevant unstackable or unreachable query returns true, the plan is deemed feasible."

However, in the last step, the planning problem is constrained by new information obtained by perceptual processing and the planner restarted with the new planning problem.\nConsider, for instance, the planning problem presented in Section 3.3. After the computation of an infeasible plan and identification of reasons for its infeasibility, the planning problem can be modified as follows, ensuring that no more infeasible plans with the same reasons for infeasibility are computed:\n:- query\nmaxstep :: 0..3; % Initial State 0: is_at(sco2)=loc_0x0, ori_is(sco2)=vert,\nis_at(obj1)=loc_2x1, ori_is(obj1)=vert;\n% Constraints T=<maxstep-1 ->> (T: -move(sco2,obj1,PUT_ORI)); T=<maxstep-1 ->> (T: ori_is(sco2)=vert\n->> -move(sco3,obj1,PUT_ORI));\nT=<maxstep-1 ->> (T: (is_below(loc_3x1,sco2);\nori_is(sco2)=vert) ->> -move(OBJ,loc_3x2,BLOCKED_ORI));\nT=<maxstep-1 ->> (T: (is_below(loc_3x1,sco2),\nori_is(sco2)=vert, is_below(loc_3x2,OBJ)) ->> -move(OBJ,TARGET_LOC,PUT_ORI));\n% Goal maxstep: is_below(loc_0x0,obj1).\nThe first constraint expresses that object sco2 cannot be stacked on top of object obj1. The second constraint expresses that the converse stack is not possible if object sco2 is vertically oriented (because the perception module knows that object sco2 is a bolt). The third constraint expresses that it is not possible to move an object over location loc_3x2 if object sco2 is at location loc_3x1 and is vertical. The fourth constraint states that if object sco2 is at location loc_3x1 and is vertical, then no object above table location loc_3x2 is moveable."

      "heading" : "6 Experimental Evaluation",
      "text" : "In our experiments, we consider the three different approaches to integrating planning and perception as described above, considering three problem instances. RGBD images representing the perceptual input into the system for each of the three instances, and the planning problem as it is presented to the planner after the bottom-up perceptual processing, are presented in Figure 2.\nInstance 1: The initial configuration of objects in Instance 1, visible on the left of Figure 2, consists of a vertically oriented bolt at the front on the right, in front of a large nut. A second bolt is visible on the left. The aim of this scenario is to test the planner in minor clutter to see if gain is obtained from integrating perception and planning. The task is to move the nut to the center of the workspace (move obj1 from loc_0x1 to loc_2x1). This requires the bolt to be moved first, which ultimately requires its shape to be computed to calculate the reachability of the nut. An elided example of an expected output plan:\n0: move(sco1,loc_3x0,horiz_y). 1: move(obj1,loc_2x1,horiz_y).\nInstance 2: The middle column of Figure 2 shows the second problem instance. This instance presents a scenario in which the planning needs to use minimal perceptual information as the objects in the scene are positioned such that objects apart from the object to be moved are far enough away that interactions are unlikely. The task is to move the bolt to the center of the workspace (move obj1 from loc_0x0 to loc_2x1), which does not require any other objects to be moved beforehand. For most plans, no stackability or reachability would need to be checked to determine their feasibility. A sample plan is as follows:\n0: move(obj1,loc_2x1,horiz_y).\nInstance 3: The aim of Instance 3 (Figure 2, rightmost column) is to present a scenario in which the stackability of objects is a concern. The task requires all objects to be moved to the front right of the table, and the planner must infer a plan that brings the objects there while respecting the stackability constraints that are inferred using appropriate perceptual information. The aluminium profiles are safely stacked horizontally and a single bolt is stackable on top of them as long as it is vertically oriented. The object currently at the front right of the table need be moved aside and the remaining objects stacked in the appropriate order. In general, all object shapes will need to be computed in order to verify a plan. A sample plan would be:\n0: move(sco1,loc_2x2,horiz_x). 1: move(obj1,loc_0x0,horiz_y). 2: move(obj2,loc_0x0,horiz_y). 3: move(obj3,loc_0x0,vert)."

      "heading" : "7 Results",
      "text" : "All experiments were performed on a Linux laptop with a 4-core 2.26GHz Intel i5-430M CPU and 4GB memory. For planning, we use CCalc (Version 2.0) with the SAT solver mChaff (version spelt3). For perception, we use an object segmentation and shape recognition system built on the Kinect RGBD camera and the Point Cloud Library [5] (PCL SVN revision 6849).\nFor each of the three planning problem instances described above, we ask 1) for the FIRST feasible plan, and 2) for 100 feasible plans. We analyze the results both from the point of view of plan quality and from the point of view of computation time. We report the average number of perception queries, feasible plans and infeasible plans (Table 1), and average computation times over five runs (Figures 3 and 4). The timeout is set at 2000 seconds.\nAccording to Table 1, considering quality of solutions (the proportion of number of feasible plans with respect to total number of feasible and infeasible plans), we can observe that all integration approaches give better results compared to None in almost all cases. Among the integration approaches, Pre performs the best, since all feasibility checks that are computed in advance are taken into consideration during task planning. On the other hand, Filt performs\nthe worse, since all feasibility checks are done at the very end and no information is conveyed to replanning. Repl performs better than Filt because results of feasibility checks are considered while replanning by means of constraints.\nWith respect to the amount of perceptual processing necessitated, we can observe that the maximum average number of perception queries takes place in Pre. Comparing Filt and Repl, more perceptual processing is required by Filt due to a larger variety of infeasible plans checked.\nAs for computation times, as observed in Figures 3 and 4, due to the large number of infeasible plans generated, Filt takes the maximum time for finding feasible plans. For Instance 3, Filt cannot find a feasible plan within the timeout. Since all feasibility checks can be computed in a relatively short amount of time, Pre performs better than Repl on Instance 3, but performs worse than Repl in Instance 2 where Pre does unnecessary perceptual compuation that does not reduce the time spent calculating plans. On Instance 1, the increased time spent doing perceptual processing and loading the consequently larger domain for Pre is balanced against increased time loading constraints after planning for Repl.\nThese results are in line with observations by Schüller et al. 2013 [1], where geometric reasoning is integrated with task planning. According to that work, since for some domains computing all feasibility checks in advance is not possible, Pre may not be possible at all. This can happen in domains where all possible perceptual computations take too much time."

As for computation time, however, Pre also necessitates the maximum number of perceptual queries; the minimum amount of perceptual processing is demanded by Repl which also reduces the upfront computational cost during domain loading but spends extra time due to the overhead of restarting the planner. When\na majority of the set of possible feasibility checks are required to find a plan and can be performed quickly in advance, Pre gives the best results; but as the number of external checks needed decreases with respect to the number of possible checks, Repl starts to perform better. We expect that as the number of objects increase, the number of feasibility checks will increase as well and thus Repl should continue to perform better, as observed in [1]."
