      "text" : "We study the problem of learning local metrics for nearest neighbor classification. Most previous works on local metric learning learn a number of local unrelated metrics. While this ”independence” approach delivers an increased flexibility its downside is the considerable risk of overfitting. We present a new parametric local metric learning method in which we learn a smooth metric matrix function over the data manifold. Using an approximation error bound of the metric matrix function we learn local metrics as linear combinations of basis metrics defined on anchor points over different regions of the instance space. We constrain the metric matrix function by imposing on the linear combinations manifold regularization which makes the learned metric matrix function vary smoothly along the geodesics of the data manifold. Our metric learning method has excellent performance both in terms of predictive power and scalability. We experimented with several largescale classification problems, tens of thousands of instances, and compared it with several state of the art metric learning methods, both global and local, as well as to SVM with automatic kernel selection, all of which it outperforms in a significant manner."

      "text" : "The nearest neighbor (NN) classifier is one of the simplest and most classical non-linear classification algorithms. It is guaranteed to yield an error no worse than twice the Bayes error as the number of instances approaches infinity. With finite learning instances, its performance strongly depends on the use of an appropriate distance measure. Mahalanobis metric learning [4, 15, 9, 10, 17, 14] improves the performance of the NN classifier if used instead of the Euclidean metric. It learns a global distance metric which determines the importance of the different input features and their correlations. However, since the discriminatory power of the input features might vary between different neighborhoods, learning a global metric cannot fit well the distance over the data manifold. Thus a more appropriate way is to learn a metric on each neighborhood and local metric learning [8, 3, 15, 7] does exactly that. It increases the expressive power of standard Mahalanobis metric learning by learning a number of local metrics (e.g. one per each instance).\nar X\niv :1\n20 9.\n30 56\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\nLocal metric learning has been shown to be effective for different learning scenarios. One of the first local metric learning works, Discriminant Adaptive Nearest Neighbor classification [8], DANN, learns local metrics by shrinking neighborhoods in directions orthogonal to the local decision boundaries and enlarging the neighborhoods parallel to the boundaries. It learns the local metrics independently with no regularization between them which makes it prone to overfitting. The authors of LMNN-Multiple Metric (LMNN-MM) [15] significantly limited the number of learned metrics and constrained all instances in a given region to share the same metric in an effort to combat overfitting. In the supervised setting they fixed the number of metrics to the number of classes; a similar idea has been also considered in [3]. However, they too learn the metrics independently for each region making them also prone to overfitting since the local metrics will be overly specific to their respective regions. The authors of [16] learn local metrics using a least-squares approach by minimizing a weighted sum of the distances of each instance to apriori defined target positions and constraining the instances in the projected space to preserve the original geometric structure of the data in an effort to alleviate overfitting. However, the method learns the local metrics using a learning-order-sensitive propagation strategy, and depends heavily on the appropriate definition of the target positions for each instance, a task far from obvious. In another effort to overcome the overfitting problem of the discriminative methods [8, 15], Generative Local Metric Learning, GLML, [11], propose to learn local metrics by minimizing the NN expected classification error under strong model assumptions. They use the Gaussian distribution to model the learning instances of each class. However, the strong model assumptions might easily be very inflexible for many learning problems.\nIn this paper we propose the Parametric Local Metric Learning method (PLML) which learns a smooth metric matrix function over the data manifold. More precisely, we parametrize the metric matrix of each instance as a linear combination of basis metric matrices of a small set of anchor points; this parametrization is naturally derived from an error bound on local metric approximation. Additionally we incorporate a manifold regularization on the linear combinations, forcing the linear combinations to vary smoothly over the data manifold. We develop an efficient two stage algorithm that first learns the linear combinations of each instance and then the metric matrices of the anchor points. To improve scalability and efficiency we employ a fast first-order optimization algorithm, FISTA [2], to learn the linear combinations as well as the basis metrics of the anchor points. We experiment with the PLML method on a number of large scale classification problems with tens of thousands of learning instances. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that PLML significantly improves the predictive performance over the current state-of-the-art metric learning methods, as well as over multi-class SVM with automatic kernel selection."

      "text" : "We denote by X the n×dmatrix of learning instances, the i-th row of which is the xTi ∈ Rd instance, and by y = (y1, . . . , yn)T , yi ∈ {1, . . . , c} the vector of class labels. The squared Mahalanobis distance between two instances in the input space is given by:\nd2M(xi,xj) = (xi − xj)TM(xi − xj) where M is a PSD metric matrix (M 0). A linear metric learning method learns a Mahalanobis metric M by optimizing some cost function under the PSD constraints for M and a set of additional constraints on the pairwise instance distances. Depending on the actual metric learning method, different kinds of constraints on pairwise distances are used. The most successful ones are the large margin triplet constraints. A triplet constraint denoted by c(xi,xj ,xk), indicates that in the projected space induced by M the distance between xi and xj should be smaller than the distance between xi and xk.\nVery often a single metric M can not model adequately the complexity of a given learning problem in which discriminative features vary between different neighborhoods. To address this limitation in local metric learning we learn a set of local metrics. In most cases we learn a local metric for each learning instance [8, 11], however we can also learn a local metric for some part of the instance space in which case the number of learned metrics can be considerably smaller than n, e.g. [15]. We follow the former approach and learn one local metric per instance. In principle, distances should then be defined as geodesic distances using the local metric on a Riemannian manifold. However, this is computationally difficult, thus we define the distance between instances xi and xj as:\nd2Mi(xi,xj) = (xi − xj) TMi(xi − xj)\nwhere Mi is the local metric of instance xi. Note that most often the local metric Mi of instance xi is different from that of xj . As a result, the distance d2Mi(xi,xj) does not satisfy the symmetric property, i.e. it is not a proper metric. Nevertheless, in accordance to the standard practice we will continue to use the term local metric learning following [15, 11]."

      "text" : "We assume that there exists a Lipschitz smooth vector-valued function f(x), the output of which is the vectorized local metric matrix of instance x. Learning the local metric of each instance is essentially learning the value of this function at different points over the data manifold. In order to significantly reduce the computational complexity we will approximate the metric function instead of directly learning it.\nDefinition 1 A vector-valued function f(x) on Rd is a (α, β, p)-Lipschitz smooth function with respect to a vector norm ‖·‖ if ‖f(x)− f(x′)‖ ≤ α ‖x− x′‖ and∥∥f(x)− f(x′)−∇f(x′)T (x− x′)∥∥ ≤ β ‖x− x′‖1+p, where ∇f(x′)T is the derivative of the f function at x′. We assume α, β > 0 and p ∈ (0, 1].\n[18] have shown that any Lipschitz smooth real function f(x) defined on a lower dimensional manifold can be approximated by a linear combination of function values f(u),u ∈ U, of a set U of anchor points. Based on this result we have the following lemma that gives the respective error bound for learning a Lipschitz smooth vector-valued function.\nLemma 1 Let (γ,U) be a nonnegative weighting on anchor points U in Rd. Let f be an (α, β, p)Lipschitz smooth vector function. We have for all x ∈ Rd:∥∥∥∥∥f(x)−∑\nu∈U\nγu(x)f(u) ∥∥∥∥∥ ≤ α ∥∥∥∥∥x−∑\nu∈U\nγu(x)u ∥∥∥∥∥+ β ∑ u∈U γu(x) ‖x− u‖1+p (1)\nThe proof of the above Lemma 1 is similar to the proof of Lemma 2.1 in [18]; for lack of space we omit its presentation. By the nonnegative weighting strategy (γ,U), the PSD constraints on the approximated local metric is automatically satisfied if the local metrics of anchor points are PSD matrices.\nLemma 1 suggests a natural way to approximate the local metric function by parameterizing the metric Mi of each instance xi as a weighted linear combination, Wi ∈ Rm, of a small set of metric basis, {Mb1 , . . . ,Mbm}, each one associated with an anchor point defined in some region of the instance space. This parametrization will also provide us with a global way to regularize the flexibility of the metric function. We will first learn the vector of weights Wi for each instance xi, and then the basis metric matrices; these two together, will give us the Mi metric for the instance xi.\nMore formally, we define a m × d matrix U of anchor points, the i-th row of which is the anchor point ui, where uTi ∈ Rd. We denote by Mbi the Mahalanobis metric matrix associated with ui. The anchor points can be defined using some clustering algorithm, we have chosen to define them as the means of clusters constructed by the k-means algorithm. The local metric Mi of an instance xi is parametrized by:\nMi = ∑ bk WibkMbk , Wibk ≥ 0, ∑ bk Wibk = 1 (2)\nwhere W is a n ×m weight matrix, and its Wibk entry is the weight of the basis metric Mbk for the instance xi. The constraint ∑ bk Wibk = 1 removes the scaling problem between different local metrics. Using the parametrization of equation (2), the squared distance of xi to xj under the metric Mi is:\nd2Mi(xi,xj) = ∑ bk Wibkd 2 Mbk (xi,xj) (3)\nwhere d2Mbk (xi,xj) is the squared Mahalanobis distance between xi and xj under the basis metric Mbk . We will show in the next section how to learn the weights of the basis metrics for each instance and in section 3.2 how to learn the basis metrics.\nAlgorithm 1 Smoothl Local Linear Weight Learning Input: W0, X, U, G, L, λ1, and λ2 Output: matrix W define g̃β,Y(W) = g(Y) + tr(∇g(Y)T (W −Y)) + β2 ‖W −Y‖ 2 F\ninitialize: t1 = 1, β = 1,Y1 = W0, and i = 0 repeat i = i+ 1, Wi = Proj((Yi − 1β∇g(Y i)))\nwhile g(Wi) > g̃β,Yi(Wi) do β = 2β, Wi = Proj((Yi − 1β∇g(Y i))) end while ti+1 = 1+ √ 1+4t2i 2 , Y i+1 = Wi + ti−1ti+1 (W i −Wi−1)\nuntil converges;"

      "text" : "Lemma 1 bounds the approximation error by two terms. The first term states that x should be close to its linear approximation, and the second that the weighting should be local. In addition we want the local metrics to vary smoothly over the data manifold. To achieve this smoothness we rely on manifold regularization and constrain the weight vectors of neighboring instances to be similar. Following this reasoning we will learn Smooth Local Linear Weights for the basis metrics by minimizing the error bound of (1) together with a regularization term that controls the weight variation of similar instances. To simplify the objective function, we use the term\n∥∥x−∑u∈U γu(x)u∥∥2 instead of\n∥∥x−∑u∈U γu(x)u∥∥. By including the constraints on the W weight matrix in (2), the optimization problem is given by:\nmin W\ng(W) = ‖X−WU‖2F + λ1tr(WG) + λ2tr(W TLW) (4)\ns.t. Wibk ≥ 0, ∑ bk Wibk = 1,∀i, bk\nwhere tr(·) and ‖·‖F denote respectively the trace norm of a square matrix and the Frobenius norm of a matrix. The m× n matrix G is the squared distance matrix between each anchor point ui and each instance xj , obtained for p = 1 in (1), i.e. its (i, j) entry is the squared Euclidean distance between ui and xj . L is the n × n Laplacian matrix constructed by D − S, where S is the n × n symmetric pairwise similarity matrix of learning instances and D is a diagonal matrix with Dii =∑ k Sik. Thus the minimization of the tr(W\nTLW) term constrains similar instances to have similar weight coefficients. The minimization of the tr(WG) term forces the weights of the instances to reflect their local properties. Most often the similarity matrix S is constructed using k-nearest neighbors graph [19]. The λ1 and λ2 parameters control the importance of the different terms.\nSince the cost function g(W) is convex quadratic with W and the constraint is simply linear, (4) is a convex optimization problem with a unique optimal solution. The constraints on W in (4) can be seen as n simplex constraints on each row of W; we will use the projected gradient method to solve the optimization problem. At each iteration t, the learned weight matrix W is updated by:\nWt+1 = Proj(Wt − η∇g(Wt)) (5) where η > 0 is the step size and ∇g(Wt) is the gradient of the cost function g(W) at Wt. The Proj(·) denotes the simplex projection operator on each row of W. Such a projection operator can be efficiently implemented with a complexity of O(nm log(m)) [6]. To speed up the optimization procedure we employ a fast first-order optimization method FISTA, [2]. The detailed algorithm is described in Algorithm 1. The Lipschitz constant β required by this algorithm is estimated by using the condition of g(Wi) ≤ g̃β,Yi(Wi) [1]. At each iteration, the main computations are in the gradient and the objective value with complexity O(nmd+ n2m).\nTo set the weights of the basis metrics for a testing instance we can optimize (4) given the weight of the basis metrics for the training instances. Alternatively we can simply set them as the weights of its nearest neighbor in the training instances. In the experiments we used the latter approach."

      "heading" : "3.2 Large Margin Basis Metric Learning",
      "text" : "In this section we define a large margin based algorithm to learn the basis metrics Mb1 , . . . ,Mbm . Given the W weight matrix of basis metrics obtained using Algorithm 1, the local metric Mi of an instance xi defined in (2) is linear with respect to the basis metrics Mb1 , . . . ,Mbm . We define the relative comparison distance of instances xi, xj and xk as: d2Mi(xi,xk) − d 2 Mi\n(xi,xj). In a large margin constraint c(xi,xj ,xk), the squared distance d2Mi(xi,xk) is required to be larger than d2Mi(xi,xj) + 1, otherwise an error ξijk ≥ 0 is generated. Note that, this relative comparison definition is different from that defined in LMNN-MM [15]. In LMNN-MM to avoid over-fitting, different local metrics Mj and Mk are used to compute the squared distance d2Mj (xi,xj) and d2Mk(xi,xk) respectively, as no smoothness constraint is added between metrics of different local regions.\nGiven a set of triplet constraints, we learn the basis metrics Mb1 , . . . ,Mbm with the following optimization problem:\nmin Mb1 ,...,Mbm ,ξ\nα1 ∑ bl ||Mbl ||2F + ∑ ijk ξijk + α2 ∑ ij ∑ bl Wibld 2 Mbl (xi,xj) (6)\ns.t. ∑ bl Wibl(d 2 Mbl (xi,xk)− d2Mbl (xi,xj)) ≥ 1− ξijk ∀i, j, k\nξijk ≥ 0; ∀i, j, k Mbl 0; ∀bl\nwhere α1 and α2 are parameters that balance the importance of the different terms. The large margin triplet constraints for each instance are generated using its k1 same class nearest neighbors and k2 different class nearest neighbors by requiring its distances to the k2 different class instances to be larger than those to its k1 same class instances. In the objective function of (6) the basis metrics are learned by minimizing the sum of large margin errors and the sum of squared pairwise distances of each instance to its k1 nearest neighbors computed using the local metric. Unlike LMNN we add the squared Frobenius norm on each basis metrics in the objective function. We do this for two reasons. First we exploit the connection between LMNN and SVM shown in [5] under which the squared Frobenius norm of the metric matrix is related to the SVM margin. Second because adding this term leads to an easy-to-optimize dual formulation of (6) [12].\nUnlike many special solvers which optimize the primal form of the metric learning problem [15, 13], we follow [12] and optimize the Lagrangian dual problem of (6). The dual formulation leads to an efficient basis metric learning algorithm. Introducing the Lagrangian dual multipliers γijk, pijk and the PSD matrices Zbl to respectively associate with every large margin triplet constraints, ξijk ≥ 0 and the PSD constraints Mbl 0 in (6), we can easily derive the following Lagrangian dual form\nmax Zb1 ,...,Zbm ,γ\n∑ ijk γijk − ∑ bl 1 4α1 · ‖Zbl + ∑ ijk γijkWiblCijk − α2 ∑ ij WiblAij‖2F (7)\ns.t. 1 ≥ γijk ≥ 0; ∀i,j,k Zbl 0; ∀bl\nand the corresponding optimality conditions: M∗bl = (Z∗bl\n+ ∑\nijk γ ∗ ijkWiblCijk−α2 ∑ ij WiblAij)\n2α1 and\n1 ≥ γijk ≥ 0, where the matrices Aij and Cijk are given by xTijxij and xTikxik−xTijxij respectively, where xij = xi − xj . Compared to the primal form, the main advantage of the dual formulation is that the second term in the objective function of (7) has a closed-form solution for Zbl given a fixed γ. To drive the optimal solution of Zbl , let Kbl = α2 ∑ ijWiblAij − ∑ ijk γijkWiblCijk. Then, given a fixed γ, the optimal solution of Zbl is Z ∗ bl\n= (Kbl)+, where (Kbl)+ projects the matrix Kbl onto the PSD cone, i.e. (Kbl)+ = U[max(diag(Σ)),0)]U T with Kbl = UΣU T.\nNow, (7) is rewritten as:\nmin γ\ng(γ) = − ∑ ijk γijk + ∑ bl 1 4α1 ‖(Kbl)+ −Kbl‖ 2 F (8)\ns.t. 1 ≥ γijk ≥ 0;∀i, j, k\nAnd the optimal condition for Mbl is M ∗ bl = 12α1 ((K ∗ bl )+ −K∗bl). The gradient of the objective function in (8), ∇g(γijk), is given by: ∇g(γijk) = −1 + ∑ bl 1 2α1 〈(Kbl)+ −Kbl ,WiblCijk〉. At each iteration, γ is updated by:\nγi+1 = BoxProj(γi − η∇g(γi)) (9)\nwhere η > 0 is the step size. The BoxProj(·) denotes the simple box projection operator on γ as specified in the constraints of (8). At each iteration, the main computational complexity lies in the computation of the eigen-decomposition with a complexity of O(md3) and the computation of the gradient with a complexity of O(m(nd2 + cd)), where m is the number of basis metrics and c is the number of large margin triplet constraints. As in the weight learning problem the FISTA algorithm is employed to accelerate the optimization process; for lack of space we omit the algorithm presentation."

      "heading" : "4 Experiments",
      "text" : "In this section we will evaluate the performance of PLML and compare it with a number of relevant baseline methods on six datasets with large number of instances, ranging from 5K to 70K instances; these datasets are Letter, USPS, Pendigits, Optdigits, Isolet and MNIST. We want to determine whether the addition of manifold regularization on the local metrics improves the predictive performance of local metric learning, and whether the local metric learning improves over learning with single global metric. We will compare PLML against six baseline methods. The first, SML, is a variant of PLML where a single global metric is learned, i.e. we set the number of basis in (6) to one. The second, Cluster-Based LML (CBLML), is also a variant of PLML without weight learning. Here we learn one local metric for each cluster and we assign a weight of one for a basis metric Mbi if the corresponding cluster of Mbi contains the instance, and zero otherwise. Finally, we also compare against four state of the art metric learning methods LMNN [15], BoostMetric [13]1, GLML [11] and LMNN-MM [15]2. The former two learn a single global metric and the latter two a number of local metrics. In addition to the different metric learning methods, we also compare PLML against multi-class SVMs in which we use the one-against-all strategy to determine the class label for multi-class problems and select the best kernel with inner cross validation.\nSince metric learning is computationally expensive for datasets with large number of features we followed [15] and reduced the dimensionality of the USPS, Isolet and MINIST datasets by applying PCA. In these datasets the retained PCA components explain 95% of their total variances. We preprocessed all datasets by first standardizing the input features, and then normalizing the instances to so that their L2-norm is one.\nPLML has a number of hyper-parameters. To reduce the computational time we do not tune λ1 and λ2 of the weight learning optimization problem (4), and we set them to their default values of λ1 = 1 and λ2 = 100. The Laplacian matrix L is constructed using the six nearest neighbors graph following [19]. The anchor points U are the means of clusters constructed with k-means clustering. The number m of anchor points, i.e. the number of basis metrics, depends on the complexity of the learning problem. More complex problems will often require a larger number of anchor points to better model the complexity of the data. As the number of classes in the examined datasets is 10 or 26, we simply set m = 20 for all datasets. In the basis metric learning problem (6), the number of the dual parameters γ is the same as the number of triplet constraints. To speedup the learning process, the triplet constraints are constructed only using the three same-class and the three different-class nearest neighbors for each learning instance. The parameter α2 is set to 1, while the parameter α1 is the only parameter that we select from the set {0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100} using 2-fold inner cross-validation. The above setting of basis metric learning for PLML is also used with the SML and CBLML methods. For LMNN and LMNN-MM we use their default settings, [15], in which the triplet constraints are constructed by the three nearest same-class neighbors and all different-class samples. As a result, the number of triplet constraints optimized in LMNN and LMNN-MM is much larger than those of PLML, SML, BoostMetric and CBLML. The local metrics are initialized by identity matrices. As in [11], GLML uses the Gaussian distribution to model the learning instances from the same class. Finally, we use the 1-NN rule to evaluate the performance\n1http://code.google.com/p/boosting 2http://www.cse.wustl.edu/∼kilian/code/code.html.\nof the different metric learning methods. In addition as we already mentioned we also compare against multi-class SVM. Since the performance of the latter depends heavily on the kernel with which it is coupled we do automatic kernel selection with inner cross validation to select the best kernel and parameter setting. The kernels were chosen from the set of linear, polynomial (degree 2,3 and 4), and Gaussian kernels; the width of the Gaussian kernel was set to the average of all pairwise distances. Its C parameter of the hinge loss term was selected from {0.1, 1, 10, 100}. To estimate the classification accuracy for Pendigits, Optdigits, Isolet and MNIST we used the default train and test split, for the other datasets we used 10-fold cross-validation. The statistical significance of the differences were tested with McNemar’s test with a p-value of 0.05. In order to get a better understanding of the relative performance of the different algorithms for a given dataset we used a simple ranking schema in which an algorithm A was assigned one point if it was found to have a statistically significantly better accuracy than another algorithm B, 0.5 points if the two algorithms did not have a significant difference, and zero points if A was found to be significantly worse than B."

      "text" : "In Table 1 we report the experimental results. PLML consistently outperforms the single global metric learning methods LMNN, BoostMetric and SML, for all datasets except Isolet on which its accuracy is slightly lower than that of LMNN. Depending on the single global metric learning method with which we compare it, it is significantly better in three, four, and five datasets ( for LMNN, SML, and BoostMetric respectively), out of the six and never singificantly worse. When we compare PLML with CBLML and LMNN-MM, the two baseline methods which learn one local metric for each cluster and each class respectively with no smoothness constraints, we see that it is statistically significantly better in all the datasets. GLML fails to learn appropriate metrics on all datasets because its fundamental generative model assumption is often not valid. Finally, we see that PLML is significantly better than SVM in two out of the six datasets and it is never significantly worse; remember here that with SVM we also do inner fold kernel selection to automatically select the appropriate feature speace. Overall PLML is the best performing methods scoring 37 points over the different datasets, followed by SVM with automatic kernel selection and SML which score 32.5 and 28.5 points respectively. The other metric learning methods perform rather poorly.\nExamining more closely the performance of the baseline local metric learning methods CBLML and LMNN-MM we observe that they tend to overfit the learning problems. This can be seen by their considerably worse performance with respect to that of SML and LMNN which rely on a single\nglobal model. On the other hand PLML even though it also learns local metrics it does not suffer from the overfitting problem due to the manifold regularization. The poor performance of LMNNMM is not in agreement with the results reported in [15]. The main reason for the difference is the experimental setting. In [15], 30% of the training instance of each dataset were used as a validation set to avoid overfitting.\nTo provide a better understanding of the behavior of the learned metrics, we applied PLML LMNNMM, CBLML and GLML, on an image dataset containing instances of four different handwritten digits, zero, one, two, and four, from the MNIST dataset. As in [15], we use the two main principal components to learn. Figure 1 shows the learned local metrics by plotting the axis of their corresponding ellipses(black line). The direction of the longer axis is the more discriminative. Clearly PLML fits the data much better than LMNN-MM and as expected its local metrics vary smoothly. In terms of the predictive performance, PLML has the best with 82.76% accuracy. The CBLML, LMNN-MM and GLML have an almost identical performance with respective accuracies of 82.59%, 82.56% and 82.51%.\nFinally we investigated the sensitivity of PLML and CBLML to the number of basis metrics, we experimented with m ∈ {5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40}. The results are given in Figure 2. We see that the predictive performance of PLML often improves as we increase the number of the basis metrics. Its performance saturates when the number of basis metrics becomes sufficient to model the underlying training data. As expected different learning problems require different number of basis metrics. PLML does not overfit on any of the datasets. In contrast, the performance of CBLML gets worse when the number of basis metrics is large which provides further evidence that CBLML does indeed overfit the learning problems, demonstrating clearly the utility of the manifold regularization."

While this ”independence” approach delivers an increased flexibility its downside is the considerable risk of overfitting. We present a new parametric local metric learning method in which we learn a smooth metric matrix function over the data manifold. Using an approximation error bound of the metric matrix function we learn local metrics as linear combinations of basis metrics defined on anchor points over different regions of the instance space. We constrain the metric matrix function by imposing on the linear combinations manifold regularization which makes the learned metric matrix function vary smoothly along the geodesics of the data manifold. Our metric learning method has excellent performance both in terms of predictive power and scalability. We experimented with several largescale classification problems, tens of thousands of instances, and compared it with several state of the art metric learning methods, both global and local, as well as to SVM with automatic kernel selection, all of which it outperforms in a significant manner.",
