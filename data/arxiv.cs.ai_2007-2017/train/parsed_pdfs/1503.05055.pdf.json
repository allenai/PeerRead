Some combination rules mix evidential information where sources are independent; other rules are suited to combine evidential information held by dependent sources. In this paper we have two main contributions: First we suggest a method to quantify sources’ degree of independence that may guide the choice of the more appropriate set of combination rules. Second, we propose a new combination rule that takes consideration of sources’ degree of independence. The proposed method is illustrated on generated mass functions.

In the theory of belief functions, many combination rules are proposed, some of them like [2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] are fitted to the aggregation of evidential information provided by cognitively independent sources whereas the cautious, bold [10] and mean combination rules can be applied when sources are cognitively dependent. The choice of combination rules depends on sources independence.\nSome researches are focused on doxastic independence of variables such as [11, 12]; others [4, 13] tackled cognitive and evidential independence of variables. This paper is focused on measuring the independence of sources and not that of variables. We suggest a statistical approach to estimate the independence of sources on the bases of all evidential information that they provide. The aim of estimating the independence of sources is to guide the choice of the combination rule to be used when combining their evidential information.\nWe propose also a new combination rule to aggregate evidential information and take into account the independence degree of their sources. The proposed combination rule is weighted with that degree of independence leading to the conjunctive rule [14] when sources are fully independent and to the cautious rule [10] when they are fully dependent.\nIn the sequel, we introduce in Section 2 preliminaries of the theory of belief functions. In the Section 3, an evidential clustering algorithm is detailed. This clustering algorithm will be used in the first step of the independence measure process. Independence measure is then detailed in Section 4. It is estimated in four steps: In the first step the clustering algorithm is applied. Second a mapping between clusters is performed; then independence of clusters and sources are deduced in the last two steps. Independence is learned for only two sources and then generalized for\na greater number of sources. A new combination rule is proposed in the Section 5 taking into account the independence degree of sources. The proposed method is tested on random mass functions in Section 6. Finally, conclusions are drawn."

      "text" : "The theory of belief functions was introduced by Dempster [3] and formalized by Shafer [4] to model imperfect data. The frame of discernment also called universe of discourse, Ω = {ω1,ω2, . . . ,ωN}, is an exhaustive set of N mutually exclusive hypotheses ωi. The power set 2Ω is a set of all subsets of Ω; it is made of hypotheses and unions of hypotheses from Ω. The basic belief assignment (BBA) commonly called mass function is a function defined on the power set 2Ω and spans the interval [0,1] such that:\n∑ A⊆Ω m(A) = 1 (1)\nA basic belief mass (BBM) also called mass, m(A), is a degree of faith on the truth of A. The BBM, m(A), is a degree of belief on A which can be committed to its subsets if further information justifies it [7].\nSubsets A having a strictly positive mass are called focal elements. Union of all focal elements is called core. Shafer [4] assumed a normality condition such that m( /0) = 0, thereafter Smets [14] relaxed this condition in order to tolerate m( /0)> 0.\nThe frame of discernment can also be a focal element; its BBM, m(Ω), is inter-\npreted as a degree of ignorance. In the case of total ignorance, m(Ω) = 1.\nA simple support function is a mass function with two focal elements including\nthe frame of discernment. A simple support function m is defined as follows:\nm(A) =\n    \n   \n1−w i f A = B for some B ⊂ Ω w if A = Ω 0 otherwise\n(2)\nWhere A is a focus of that simple support function and w ∈ [0,1] is its weight. A simple support function is simply noted Aw. A nondogmatic mass function can be obtained by the combination of several simple support functions. Therefore, any nondogmatic mass function can be decomposed into several support functions using the canonical decomposition proposed by Smets [15].\nThe belief function (bel) is computed from a BBA m. The amount bel(A) is the\nminimal belief on A justified by available information on B (B ⊆ A):\nbel(A) = ∑ B⊆A,B 6= /0 m(B) (3)\nThe plausibility function (pl) is also derived from a BBA m. The amount pl(A) is the maximal belief on A justified by information on B which are not contradictory with A (A∩B 6= /0):\npl(A) = ∑ A∩B 6= /0 m(B) (4)\nPignistic transformation computes pignistic probabilities from mass functions in the purpose of making a decision. The pignistic probability of a single hypothesis A is given by:\nBetP(A) = ∑ B⊆Ω,B 6= /0 |B∩A| |B| m(B) 1−m( /0) . (5)\nDecision is made according to the maximum pignistic probability. The single point having the greatest BetP is the most likely hypothesis."

      "heading" : "2.2. Combination rules",
      "text" : "In the theory of belief functions, a great number of combination rules are used to summarize a set of mass functions into only one. Let s1 and s2 be two distinct and cognitively independent sources providing two different mass functions m1 and m2 defined on the same frame of discernment Ω. Combining these mass functions induces a third one m12 defined on the same frame of discernment Ω.\nThere is a great number of combination rules [2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], but we enumerate in this section only Dempster, conjunctive, disjunctive, Yager, Dubois and Prade, mean, cautious and bold combination rules. The first combination rule was proposed by Dempster in [3] to combine two distinct mass functions m1 and m2 as follows:\nm1⊕2(A) = (m1 ⊕m2)(A) =\n     \n    \n∑ B∩C=A m1(B)×m2(C)\n1− ∑ B∩C= /0\nm1(B)×m2(C) ∀A ⊆ Ω, A 6= /0\n0 i f A = /0\n(7)\nThe BBM of the empty set is null (m( /0) = 0). This rule verifies the normality condition and works under a closed world where Ω is exhaustive.\nIn order to solve the problem highlighted by Zadeh’s counter example [16]\nwhere Dempster’s rule of combination produced unsatisfactory results, many combination rules appeared. Smets [14] proposed an open world where a positive mass can be allocated to the empty set. Hence the conjunctive rule of combination for two mass functions m1 and m2 is defined as follows:\nm1 ∩©2(A) = (m1 ∩©m2)(A) = ∑ B∩C=A m1(B)×m2(C) (8)\nEven if Smets [17] interpreted the BBM, m1 ∩©2( /0), as an amount of conflict between evidences that induced m1 and m2; that amount is not really a conflict because it includes a certain degree of auto-conflict due to the non-idempotence of the conjunctive combination [18].\nThe conjunctive rule is used only when both sources are reliable. Smets [14] proposed also to use a disjunctive combination when an unknown source is unreliable. The disjunctive rule of combination is defined for two BBAs m1 and m2 as follows:\nm1 ∪©2(A) = (m1 ∪©m2)(A) = ∑ B∪C=A m1(B)×m2(C) (9)\nYager in [8] interpreted m( /0) as an amount of ignorance; consequently it is allocated to Ω. Yager’s rule of combination is also defined to combine two mass functions m1 and m2 as follows: \n   \n   \nmY (X) = m1 ∩©2(X) ∀X ⊂ Ω, X 6= /0 mY (Ω) = m1 ∩©2(Ω)+m1 ∩©2( /0) mY ( /0) = 0\n(10)\nDubois and Prade’s solution [2] was to affect the mass resulting from the combination of conflicting focal elements to the union of these subsets:\n  \n \nmDP(B) = m1 ∩©2(B)+ ∑ A∩X= /0, A∪X=B m1(X)m2(A) ∀A ⊆ Ω, A 6= /0 mDP( /0) = 0\n(11)\nConjunctive, disjunctive and Dempster’s rules are associative and commutative, but Yager and Dubois and Prade’s rules are not associative, even if they are commutative. Unfortunately, all combination rules described above are not idempotent because m ∩©m 6= m and m ∪©m 6= m.\nMean combination rule detailed in [6], mMean, of two mass functions m1 and m2 is the average of these ones. Therefore, for each focal element A of M mass functions, the combined one is defined as follows:\nmMean(A) = 1 M\nM\n∑ i=1 mi(A) (12)\nBesides idempotence, this combination rule verifies normality condition (m( /0) = 0) if combined mass functions are normalized (∀i ∈ M, mi( /0) = 0). We note also that this combination rule is commutative but not associative.\nAll combination rules described above work under a strong assumption of cognitive independence since they are used to combine mass functions induced by two distinct sources. This strong assumption is always assumed but never verified. Denoeux [10], proposed a family of conjunctive and disjunctive rules based on triangular norms and conorms. Cautious and bold rules are members of that family and combine mass functions for which independence assumption is not verified. Cautious combination of two mass functions m1 and m2 issued from probably dependent sources is defined as follows:\nm1 ∧©m2 = ∩©A⊂Ω A w1(A)∧w2(A) (13)\nWhere Aw1(A) and Aw2(A) are simple support functions focused on A with weights\nw1 and w2 issued from the canonical decomposition [15] of m1 and m2 respectively, note also that ∧ is a min operator of simple support functions weights. The bold and cautious combination rules are commutative, associative and idempotent.\nTo summarize, the choice of the combination rule is based on the dependence\nof sources. Combination rules like [2, 5, 6, 7, 8] combine mass functions which sources are independent, whereas cautious, bold and mean rules are the most fitted to combine mass functions issued from dependent sources.\nIn this paper, we propose a method to quantify sources’ degrees of independence that may be used in a new mixed combination rule. In fact, we propose a statistical approach to learn sources’ degrees of independence from all provided evidential information. Indeed, two sets of evidential information assessed by two different sources are classified into two sets of clusters. Clusters of both sources are matched and the independence of each couple of matched clusters is quantified in order to estimate sources’ degrees of independence. Therefore, a clustering technique is used to gather similar objects into the same cluster in order to study the source’s overall behavior. Before introducing our learning method, we detail in the next section the evidential clustering algorithm that will be used in the learning of sources’ degrees of independence."

      "heading" : "3. Evidential clustering",
      "text" : "In this paper, we propose a new clustering technique to classify objects; their attributes values are evidential and classes are unknown. Proposed clustering algorithm uses a distance on belief functions given by Jousselme et al. [19] such as proposed by Ben Hariz et al. [20].\nBen Hariz et al. [20] detailed a belief K-modes classifier in which Jousselme distance [19] is adapted to quantify distances between objects and clusters modes. These are sets of mass functions; each one is the combination of an attribute’s values of all objects classified into that cluster. An object is attributed to the cluster having the minimum distance to its mode.\nTemporal complexity of clustering algorithm proposed by Ben Hariz et al. [20]\nis quite high as clusters modes and distances are computed in each iteration. The combination by the mean rule to compute modes values leads to mass functions with a high number of focal elements. Hence, the bigger the cluster is, the least significant is the distance.\nWe propose a clustering technique to classify objects that attributes values are uncertain. However uncertainty is modeled with the theory of belief functions detailed in Section 2. In the proposed algorithm, we do not use any cluster mode to avoid the growth of focal elements number in clusters modes. Temporal complexity is also significantly reduced because all distances are computed only once.\nIn this section, K is the number of clusters Clk (1 ≤ k ≤ K); n is the number of objects to be classified; nk is the number of objects classified into cluster Clk; oi are objects to classify oi : 1 ≤ i ≤ n; c is the number of evidential attributes a j : 1 ≤ j ≤ c which domains are Ωa j and finally mi j is a mass function value of attribute “ j” for object “i”. Mass functions mi j can be certain, probabilistic, possibilistic, evidential and even missing.\nTo classify objects oi into K clusters, we use a clustering algorithm with a distance on belief functions given by [19]. The number of clusters K is assumed to be known. Proposed clustering technique is based on a distance which quantifies how much is far an object oi from a cluster Clk. This distance is the mean of distances between oi, and all objects oq that are classified into cluster Clk as follows:\nD(oi,Clk) = 1 nk\nnk\n∑ q=1 dist(oi,oq) (14)\nand\ndist(oi,oq) = 1 c\nc\n∑ j=1 d(mi j,mq j) (15)\nwith :\nd(mi j,mq j) =\n√\n1 2 (mi j −mq j)tD(mi j −mq j) (16)\nsuch that :\nD(A,B) =\n \n 1 if A = B = /0 |A∩B| |A∪B| ∀A,B ∈ 2 Ωa j (17)\nEach object is affected to the most similar cluster in an iterative way till reaching an unchanged cluster partition. It is obvious that clusters number K must be known. Temporal complexity of the proposed algorithm is significantly optimized as pairwise distances are computed once a time from the beginning. We do not use any cluster mode. Consequently, there will be no problem of increasing number of focal elements because attributes values are not combined. Indeed, the evidential clustering algorithm provides a cluster partition that minimizes distances between objects into the same cluster and maximizes the distance between objects classified into different clusters. The main asset of the evidential clustering algorithm according to the belief K-modes proposed by Ben Hariz et al. [20] is the optimization of the temporal complexity. In fact, run-time of the evidential clustering algorithm is improved. The optimization of run-time depends on the size of the frame of discernment |Ωa j |, the number of clusters K and number of objects n. For example, figure 1 shows a big gain in the run-time of evidential clustering according to the belief K-modes when the number of mass functions varies, n ∈ [10,1000]. Temporal complexity of the evidential clustering algorithm is optimized and that optimization is especially noticed when the number of mass functions to classify is high and also when the frame of discernment contains many hypotheses. Thanks to the improve of the temporal complexity, this clustering algorithm is used in the following sections."

      "heading" : "4. Learning sources independence degree",
      "text" : "In this section we extend paper [21] for many sources, and propose a combination rule emphasizing sources independence degree. In the theory of prob-\nabilities, two hypotheses X and Y are assumed to be statistically independent if P(X ∩Y ) = P(X)×P(Y) or P(X |Y ) = P(X). In the context of the theory of belief functions, Shafer [4] defined cognitive and evidential independence.\nDefinition 1. “Two frames of discernment may be called cognitively independent with respect to the evidence if new evidence that bears on only one of them will not change the degree of support for propositions discerned by the other” 1.\nThe cognitive independence is a weak independence; two variables are independent with respect to a mass function if new evidence that bears on only one of the two variables does not change propositions discerned by the other one. For two variables X and Y such that ΩX and ΩY their domains (frames of discernment) and ΩX ×ΩY the product space of domains ΩX and ΩY . Variables X and Y are cognitively independent with respect to mΩX×ΩY if:\nplΩX×ΩY (x,y) = plΩX×ΩY↓ΩX (x)× plΩX×ΩY ↓ΩY (y) (18)\n1[4], page 149\nNote that ΩX ×ΩY ↓ ΩX is the marginalization of ΩX ×ΩY in ΩX [7, 22]. Shafer [4] defined also a strong independence called evidential independence as follows:\nDefinition 2. “Two frames of discernment are evidentially independent with respect to a support function if that support function could be obtained by combining evidence that bears on only one of them with evidence that bears on only the other”.\nTwo variables are evidentially independent if their joint mass function can be obtained by combining marginal mass functions that bears on each one of them. Variables X and Y are evidentially independent with respect to mΩX×ΩY if: \n\n\nplΩX×ΩY (x,y) = plΩX×ΩY↓ΩX (x)× plΩX×ΩY↓ΩY (y) belΩX×ΩY (x,y) = belΩX×ΩY↓ΩX (x)×belΩX×ΩY↓ΩY (y) (19)\nIndependence can also be defined in terms of irrelevance. The knowledge of the value of one variable does not change the belief on the other one. In the theory of belief functions, irrelevance is based on the conditioning. Variables X and Y are irrelevant with respect to m, IRm(X ,Y ) if the marginal mass function on X is obtained by conditioning the joint mass function on values y of Y and marginalizing this conditioned joint mass function on X :\nmΩX×ΩY↓ΩX[y] (x) ∝ m ΩX×ΩY ↓ΩX (x) (20)\nNote that proportionality ∝ is replaced by equality when mΩX×ΩY ↓ΩX[y] and m ΩX×ΩY↓ΩX are normalized.\nDoxastic independence is especially proposed in the theory of belief functions\nby [11, 12] and it is defined as follows: Definition 3. “Two variables are considered as doxastically independent only when they are irrelevant and this irrelevance is preserved under Dempster’s rules of combination”.\nIn other words, two variables X and Y are doxastically independent if they are irrelevant with respect to m⊕m0 when they are irrelevant with respect to m and m0. Indeed, if X and Y are irrelevant according to any mass function m and if they are also irrelevant with respect to another mass function m0; they are assumed to be doxastically independent if they are irrelevant with respect to the orthogonal sum of m and m0 . Thus, if IRm(X ,Y ), IRm0(X ,Y ) and IRm⊕m0(X ,Y ) is verified then X and Y are doxastically independent.\nThis paper is not focused on variables independence [11, 12, 4] but on sources independence. Sources independence is computed according to a set of different belief functions provided by each source separately. Sources are dependent when all their beliefs are correlated, there is a link between all mass functions they provide. This problem is not tackled till now, we noticed a lack of references treating this problem. To study sources independence, a great number of mass functions provided by both sources is needed. This set of mass functions must be defined on the same frame of discernment according to the same problems. For example, two distinct doctors provide n diagnoses in the examination of the same n patients. In that case, the frame of discernment contains all diseases and is already the same for both doctors. We define sources independence as follows:\nDefinition 4. Two sources are cognitively independent if they do not communicate and if their evidential corpora are different.\nDefinition 5. Evidential corpus is the set of all pieces of evidence held by a source.\nNot only communicating sources are considered dependent but also sources having the same background of knowledge since their beliefs are correlated. The aim of estimating sources independence is either to guide the choice of combination rules when aggregating their beliefs, or to integrate this degree of independence in a new combination rule.\nIn this paper, mass functions provided by two sources are studied in order to reveal any dependence between them. In the following, we define an independence measure Id, (Id(s1,s2)), as the independence of s1 on s2 verifying the following axioms:\n1. Non-negativity: The independence of a source s1 on another source s2, Id(s1,s2)\ncannot be negative, it is either positive or null.\n2. Normalization: The degree of independence Id is a degree over [0,1], it is\nnull when the first source is dependent on the second one, equal to 1 when it is completely independent and a degree from [0,1] otherwise.\n3. Non-symmetry: In the case where s1 is independent on s2, s2 is not necessar-\nily independent on s1. Even if s1 and s2 are mutually independent, degrees of independence are not necessarily equal.\n4. Identity: Any source is completely dependent on itself and Id(s1,s1) = 0.\nIf s1 and s2 are independent, there will be no correlation between their mass functions. The main idea of this paper is: First, classify mass functions provided by each source separately. Then, study similarities between cluster partitions to reveal any dependence between sources. By using clustering algorithm, sources overall behavior is studied. The proposed method is in three steps: First, mass functions of each source are classified. Then, similar clusters are matched. Finally, weights of linked clusters and sources independence are quantified."

For the same example of doctors, patients are objects to classify according to an attribute disease.

Distance (14) can be simplified as follows because we have only one attribute:\nD(oi,Clk) = 1 nk\nnk\n∑ q=1 d(mi,mq) (21)\nIn this paper, we fix the number of clusters to the number of hypotheses in the frame of discernment.

In this section, we try to find a mapping between clusters in order to link those containing the same objects. If clusters are perfectly linked, meaning all objects are classified similarly for both sources, we can conclude that sources are dependent as they are choosing similar focal elements (not contradictory at least) when providing mass functions for same objects. If clusters are weakly linked, sources choose similar focal elements for different objects and so they are independent. Clusters independence degree is proportional to the number of objects similarly classified. More clusters contain the same objects, more they are dependent as they are correlated.\nWe note Cl1k1 where 1 ≤ k1 ≤ K for clusters of s1 and Cl 2 k2 where 1 ≤ k2 ≤ K\nfor those of s2.

Note that β 1 k1k2 6= β 2k2k1 since the number of objects classified into Cl 1 k1 and Cl2k2 are different (|Cl 1 k1 |6=|Cl2k2 |).\nWe remind that β 1 are similarities towards s1 and β 2 are those towards s2. It\nis obvious that β i(Cliki ,Cl j k j ) = 0 when Cliki and Cl j k j do not contain any common object; however they are completely different. β i(Cliki ,Cl j k j ) = 1 when these clusters are strongly similar so they contain the same objects.

Even if this algorithm is quite simple, it provides a matching of clusters in order to compare evidential information provided by both sources.

Hence, we use simple heuristics as follows:\nα iki = 1− 1\n|Cliki | 1 |Ω|\n(26)\nAs shown in figure 2, if | Ω | and number of mass functions in a cluster are big enough, cluster independence mass function is almost not discounted.

Independence measure is non-symmetric because if a source s1 is independent on a source s2 then s2 is not necessarily independent on s1 and even if it is the case, degrees of independence are not necessarily the same.\nIt is wise to choose the minimum independence from Id(s1,s2) and Id(s2,s1) as the overall independence. Consequently, if at least one of two sources is dependent on the other, then sources are considered dependent. In other words, two sources are independent only if they are mutually independent. Hence, overall independence that is denoted I(s1,s2) is given by:\nI(s1,s2) = min(Id(s1,s2), Id(s2,s1)) (29)\nWe note that I(s1,s2) is non-negative, normalized, symmetric and identical. We define an independence measure, noted I, generalizing the independence for more than two sources verifying the following axioms:\n1. Non-negativity: Many sources independence {s1,s2,s3, . . . ,sns}, noted\nId(s1,s2, . . . ,sns) cannot be negative, it is either positive or null.\n2. Normalization: Sources independence I is a degree in [0,1]. The minimum\n0 is reached when sources are completely dependent and the maximum 1 is reached when they are completely independent.\n3.

Increasing with inclusion: I(s1,s2) ≤ I(s1,s2,s3), more there are sources,\nmore they are likely to be independent.\nTo compute the overall independence of ns sources {s1,s2, . . . ,sns}, independencies of pairs of sources are computed and the maximum4 independence is the sources overall independence:\nI(s1,s2, . . . ,sns) = max(I(si,s j)), ∀i ∈ [1,ns] , j ∈]i,ns] (30)\nor equivalently:\nI(s1,s2, . . . ,sns) = max(min(Id(si,s j), Id(s j,si))), ∀i, j ∈ [1,ns] i 6= j (31)\nIndependence degree of sources is then integrated in the combination step using the following mixed combination rule."

In the combination step, sources dependence or independence hypothesis is intuitively made without any possibility of check. Sources independence degree is neither 0 nor 1 but a level over [0,1]. The main question is “which combination rule to use when combining partially independent\\dependent mass functions?”\nIn this paper, we propose a new mixed combination rule using conjunctive and cautious rules detailed in equations (8) and (13). In the case of totally dependent sources (where independence is 0), the cautious and proposed mixed combination rules are similar; whereas in the case of totally independent sources (independence is 1), the conjunctive and proposed combination rules are similar. In the case of an independence degree in ]0,1[, combined mass function is the average of conjunctive and cautious combinations weighted by sources’ independence degree.\nAssume that two sources s1 and s2 are independent with a degree γ such that γ = I(s1,s2); m1 and m2 are mass functions provided by s1 and s2. The proposed mixed combination rule is defined as follows:\nmMixed(A) = γ ∗m ∩©(A)+ (1− γ)∗m ∧©(A), ∀A ⊆ Ω (32)\nThe degree of independence of a set of sources is given by equation (30), and the mixed combination of a set of mass functions {m1,m2, . . . ,mns} provided by sources {s1,s2, . . . ,sns} is also a weighted average such that:\nγ = I(s1,s2, . . . ,sns) (33)\nProperties of the proposed mixed combination rule:\n• Commutativity: Conjunctive and cautious rules are commutative. Indepen-\ndence measure is symmetric because sources’ degree of independence is the same for a set of sources. Then the proposed rule is commutative.\n• Associativity: Conjunctive and cautious rule are associative but the proposed\nrule is not because independence degree of n sources and n+ 1 ones is not necessarily the same.\n• Idempotent: Degree of independence of one source to itself is 0, in that case\nthe proposed rule is equivalent to the cautious rule. As the cautious rule is idempotent, it is the case of the proposed mixed rule.\n• Neutral element: Mixed combination rule does not have any neutral element.\n• Absorbing element: No absorbing element also.\nExample. Assume a frame of discernment Ω = {a,b,c} and two sources s1 and s2 providing two mass functions m1 and m2. Table 1 illustrates conjunctive and cautious combinations as well as mixed combination in the cases where γ = 0, γ = 0.3, γ = 0.6 and γ = 1. When γ = 0, mixed and cautious combinations are equivalent; when γ = 1, mixed and conjunctive combinations are equivalent, otherwise it is a weighted average by γ ∈]0,1[.\nFinally, to illustrate the proposed mixed combination rule and compare it to other combination rules, three mass functions are generated randomly using algorithm 2. These mass functions are combined with conjunctive, Dempster, Yager, disjunctive, cautious and mean combination rules. They are also combined with the mixed combination rule with different independence levels. Figure 3 illustrates distances5 between the mixed combination with several degrees of independence and combined mass functions using conjunctive, Dempster, Yager, disjunctive, cautious and mean combination rules.

Sources are cognitively independent if they are different; not communicating and they have distinct evidential corpora. The proposed statistical approach is based on a clustering algorithm applied to mass functions provided by several sources. A pair of sources independence is deduced from weights of linked clusters after a matching of their clusters. Independence degree of sources can either guide the choice of the combination rule if it is either 1 or 0; when it is a degree over ]0,1[, we propose a new combination rule that weights the conjunctive and cautious combinations with sources’ independence degree."

    "abstractText" : "The theory of belief functions manages uncertainty and also proposes a set of combination rules to aggregate opinions of several sources. Some combination rules mix evidential information where sources are independent; other rules are suited to combine evidential information held by dependent sources. In this paper we have two main contributions: First we suggest a method to quantify sources’ degree of independence that may guide the choice of the more appropriate set of combination rules. Second, we propose a new combination rule that takes consideration of sources’ degree of independence. The proposed method is illustrated on generated mass functions.",
