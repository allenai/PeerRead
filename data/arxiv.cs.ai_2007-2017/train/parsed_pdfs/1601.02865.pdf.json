      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "The purpose of this document is to describe the ESSENCE′ language and to be a reference for users of ESSENCE′. ESSENCE′ is a constraint modelling language, therefore it is mainly designed for describing NP-hard decision problems. It is not the only (or the first) constraint modelling language. ESSENCE′ began as a subset of ESSENCE [1] and has been extended from there. It is similar to the earlier Optimization Programming Language (OPL) [4]. ESSENCE′ is implemented by the tool SAVILE ROW [2, 3].\nESSENCE′ is considerably different to procedural programming languages, it does not specify a procedure to solve the problem. The user specifies the problem in terms of decision variables and constraints, and the solver automatically finds a value for each variable such that all constraints are satisfied. This means, for example, that the order the constraints are presented in ESSENCE′ is irrelevant.\nESSENCE′ allows the user to solve constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). A simple example of a CSP is a Sudoku puzzle (Figure 1). To convert a single Sudoku puzzle to CSP, each square can be represented as a decision variable with domain {1 . . . 9}. The clues (filled in squares) and the rules of the puzzle are easily expressed as constraints.\nWe will use Sudoku as a running example. A simple first attempt of modelling Sudoku in ESSENCE′ is shown below. In this case the clues (for example M[1,1]=5) are included in the model. We have used not-equal constraints to state that all digits must be used in each row and column. We have also omitted the sub-square constraints for now.\nlanguage ESSENCE’ 1.0\nfind M : matrix indexed by [int(1..9), int(1..9)] of int(1..9)\nsuch that\nM[1,1]=5, M[1,2]=3, M[1,5]=7, .... M[9,9]=9,\nforAll row : int(1..9) . forAll col1 : int(1..9) .\nforAll col2: int(col1+1..9) . M[row, col1]!=M[row, col2],\nforAll col : int(1..9) . forAll row1 : int(1..9) .\nforAll row2: int(row1+1..9) . M[row1, col]!=M[row2, col]\nIn this example, some CSP decision variables are declared using a find statement. It is also worth noting that other variables exist that are not decision variables, for example, row is a quantifier variable that exists only to apply some constraints to every row.\n1\nar X\niv :1\n60 1.\n02 86\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 2\nJa n\n20 16\n2\nAn ESSENCE′ model usually describes a class of CSPs. For example, it might describe the class of all Sudoku puzzles. In order to solve a particular instance of Sudoku, the instance would be specified in a separate parameter file (also written in ESSENCE′). The model would have parameter variables (of type integer, boolean or matrix), and the parameter file would specify a value for each of these variables.\nSince ESSENCE′ is a constraint modelling language, we will define the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). A CSP P = 〈X ,D, C〉 is defined as a set of n decision variables X = 〈x1, . . . , xn〉, a set of domains D = 〈D(x1), . . . , D(xn)〉 where D(xi) ( Z, |D(xi)| <∞ is the finite set of all potential values of xi, and a conjunction C = C1 ∧ C2 ∧ · · · ∧ Ce of constraints.\nFor CSP P = 〈X ,D, C〉, a constraint Ck ∈ C consists of a sequence of m > 0 variables Xk = 〈xk1 , . . . , xkm〉 with domains Dk = 〈D(xk1), . . . , D(xkm)〉 s.t. Xk is a subsequence1 of X , Dk is a subsequence of D, and each variable xki and domain D(xki) matches a variable xj and domain D(xj) inP . Ck has an associated set CSk ⊆ D(xk1)×· · ·×D(xkm) of tuples which specify allowed combinations of values for the variables in Xk."

      "heading" : "2.1 Types and Domains",
      "text" : "Types and domains play a similar role; they prescribe a set of values that an expression or variable can take. Types denote non-empty sets that contain all elements that have a similar structure, whereas domains denote possibly empty sets drawn from a single type. In this manner, each domain is associated with an underlying type. For example integer is the type underlying the domain comprising integers between 1 and 10. The type contains all integers, and the domain is a finite subset.\nESSENCE′ is a strongly typed language; every expression has a type, and the types of all expressions can be inferred and checked for correctness. Furthermore, ESSENCE′ is a finite-domain language; every decision variable is associated with a finite domain of values.\nThe atomic types of ESSENCE′ are int (integer) and bool (boolean). There is also a compound type, matrix, that is constructed of atomic types.\n1I use subsequence in the sense that 〈1, 3〉 is a subsequence of 〈1, 2, 3, 4〉.\nESSENCE′ Description 1.6.4\n3 There are three different types of domains in ESSENCE′: boolean, integer and matrix domains. Boolean and integer domains are both atomic domains; matrix domains are built from atomic domains.\nBoolean Domains bool is the Boolean domain consisting of false and true.\nInteger Domains An integer domain represents a finite subset of the integers, and is specified as a sequence of ranges or individual elements, for example int(1..3,5,7,9..20). Each range includes the endpoints, so the meaning of a range a..b is the set {i ∈ Z|a ≤ i ≤ b}. A range a..b would normally be in order, i.e. a<=b but this is not strictly required. Out-of-order ranges correspond to the empty set of integers.\nThe meaning of an integer domain is the union of the ranges and individual elements in the domain. For example, int(10, 1..5, 4..9) is equivalent to int(1..10).\nFinally, the elements and endpoints of ranges may be expressions of type int. The only restriction is that they may not contain any CSP decision variables. The integer expression language is described in the following sections.\nMatrix Domains A matrix is defined by the keyword matrix, followed by its dimensions and the base domain. The dimensions are a list, in square brackets, of domains. For instance,\nMatrix1 : matrix indexed by [int(1..10),int(1..10)] of int(1..5)\nis the domain of a two-dimensional square matrix, indexed by 1..10 in both dimensions, where each element of the matrix has the domain int(1..5). Elements of this matrix would be accessed by Matrix1[A,B] where A and B are integer expressions.\nMatrices may be indexed by any integer domain or the boolean domain. For example,\nMatrix2 : matrix indexed by [int(-2..5),int(-10..10,15,17)] of int(1..5)\nis a valid matrix domain."

Sets and real numbers are not (as yet) part of the language. Integer and boolean literals are straightforward:\n1 2 3 -5 true false\nThere are two forms of matrix literals. The simpler form is a comma-separated list of expressions surrounded by square brackets. For example, the following is a matrix literal containing four integer literals.\n[ 1, 3, 2, 4 ]\nESSENCE′ Description 1.6.4\n4 Matrix literals may contain any valid expression in ESSENCE′. For example a matrix literal is allowed to contain other matrix literals to build up a matrix with two or more dimensions. The types of the expressions contained in the matrix literal must all be the same.\nThe second form of matrix literal has an explicit index domain that specifies how the literal is indexed. This is specified after the comma-separated list of contents using a ; as follows.\n[ 1, 3, 2, 4 ; int(4..6,8) ]\nThe index domain must be a domain of type bool or int, and must contain the same number of values as the number of items in the matrix literal. When no index domain is specified, a matrix of size n is indexed by int(1..n).\nFinally a multi-dimensional matrix value can be expressed by nesting matrix literals. Suppose we have the following domain:\nmatrix indexed by [int(-2..0),int(1,2,4)] of int(1..5)\nOne value contained in this domain is the following:\n[ [ 1,2,3 ; int(1,2,4) ], [ 1,3,2 ; int(1,2,4) ], [ 3,2,1 ; int(1,2,4) ] ; int(-2..0) ]"

A variable may be of type integer, boolean or matrix.\nScoping of variables depends on how they are declared and is dealt with in the relevant sections below. As well as a type, variables have a category. The category is decision, quantifier or parameter. Decision variables are CSP variables, and the other categories are described below.\nExpressions containing decision variables are referred to as decision expressions, and expressions containing no decision variables as non-decision expressions. This distinction is important because expressions in certain contexts are not allowed to contain decision variables."

Because the matrix has the base domain int(1..5), M[x,y,z] will be an integer expression. Matrix indexing is a partial function: when one of the indices is out of bounds then the expression is undefined. ESSENCE′ has the relational semantics, in brief this means that the boolean expression containing the undefined expression is false. So for example, M[1,1,false]=M[2,4,true] is always false because the 4 is out of bounds. The relational semantics are more fully described in Section 4 below.\nParts of matrices can be extracted by slicing. Suppose we have the following two-dimensional matrix named N:\n[ [ 1,2,3 ; int(1,2,4) ], [ 1,3,2 ; int(1,2,4) ], [ 3,2,1 ; int(1,2,4) ] ; int(-2..0) ]\nWe could obtain the first row by writing N[-2,..], which is equal to [ 1,2,3 ; int(1..3)]. Similarly the first column can be obtained by N[..,1] which is [ 1,1,3 ; int(1..3)]. In general, the indices in a matrix slice may be .. or an integer or boolean expression that does not contain any decision variables. Matrix slices are always indexed contiguously from 1 regardless of the original matrix domain.\nWhen a matrix slice has an integer or boolean index that is out of bounds, then the expression is undefined and this is handled as described in Section 4."

Matrices can also be constructed using matrix comprehensions. This provides a very flexible way to create matrices of variables or values. A single matrix comprehension creates a one-dimensional matrix, however they can be nested to create multi-dimensional matrices. There are two syntactic forms of matrix comprehension:\n[ exp | i : domain1, j : domain2, cond1, cond2 ] [ exp | i : domain1, j : domain2, cond1, cond2 ; indexdomain ]\nwhere exp is any integer, boolean or matrix expression. This is followed by any number of comprehension variables, each with a domain. After the comprehension variables we have an optional list of conditions: these are boolean expressions that constrain the values of the comprehension variables. Finally there is an optional index domain. This provides an index domain to the constructed matrix.\nTo expand the comprehension, each assignment to the comprehension variables that satisfies the conditions is enumerated in lexicographic order. For each such assignment, the values of the comprehension variables are substituted into exp. The resulting expression then becomes one element of the constructed matrix.\nThe simplest matrix comprehensions have only one comprehension variable, as in the example below.\n[ num**2 | num : int(1..5) ] = [ 1,4,9,16,25 ; int(1..5) ]\nThe matrix constructed by a comprehension is one-dimensional and is either indexed from 1 contiguously, or has the given index domain.

Suppose M were written as a matrix literal (as in Section 2.3) the order elements are written in the matrix literal is the order the elements appear in F. The following example illustrates this for a three-dimensional matrix.\nflatten([ [ [1,2], [3,4] ], [ [5,6], [7,8] ] ]) = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]"

Constant definitions (optional)\n4. Decision variable declarations (optional)\n5. Constraints on parameter values (optional)\n6. Objective (optional)\n7. Solver Control (optional)\n8. Constraints\nParameter declaration, constant definitions and decision variable declarations can be interleaved, but for readability we suggest to put them in the order given above. Comments are preceded by ‘$’ and run to the end of the line.\nParameter values are defined in a separate file, the parameter file. Parameter files have the same header as problem models and hold a list of parameter definitions. Table 3 gives an overview of the model structure of problem and parameter files. Each model part will be discussed in more detail in the following sections.\nESSENCE′ Description 1.6.4\n13\n3.1 Parameter Declarations with given Parameters are declared with the given keyword followed by a domain the parameter ranges over. Parameters are allowed to range over the infinite domain int, or domains that contain an open range such as int(1..) and int(..10). For example,\ngiven n : int(0..)\ngiven d : int(0..n)\ndeclares two parameters, and the domain of the second depends on the value of the first. Parameters may have integer, boolean or matrix domains.\nNow we have parameters we can generalise the Sudoku model to represent the problem class of all Sudoku puzzles. The parameter is the clues matrix, where blank spaces are represented as 0 and non-zero entries in clues are copied to M.\nlanguage ESSENCE’ 1.0\ngiven clues : matrix indexed by [int(1..9), int(1..9)] of int(0..9)\nfind M : matrix indexed by [int(1..9), int(1..9)] of int(1..9)\nsuch that\nforAll row : int(1..9) . forAll col : int(1..9) .\n(clues[row, col]!=0) -> (M[row, col]=clues[row, col]),\nforAll row : int(1..9) . allDiff(M[row,..]),\nforAll col : int(1..9) . allDiff(M[..,col]),\nESSENCE′ Description 1.6.4\n14\n$ all 3x3 subsquare have to be all-different $ i,j indicate the top-left corner of the subsquare. forAll i,j : int(1,4,7) .\nallDiff([ M[k,l] | k : int(i..i+2), l : int(j..j+2)])\n3.2 Constant Definitions with letting In most problem models there are re-occurring constant values and it can be useful to define them as constants. The letting statement allows to assign a name with a constant value. The statement\nletting NAME = A\nintroduces a new identifier NAME that is associated with the expression A. Every subsequent occurrence of NAME in the model is replaced by the value of A. Please note that NAME cannot be used in the model before it has been defined. A may be any integer, boolean or matrix expression that does not contain decision variables. Some integer examples are shown below.\ngiven n : int(0..) letting c = 10 letting d = c*n*2\nHere the second integer constant depends on the first. As well as integer and boolean expressions, lettings may contain matrix expressions, as in the example below. When using a matrix literal the domain is optional – the two lettings below are equivalent. The version with the matrix domain may be useful when the matrix is not indexed from 1.\nletting cmatrix = [ [2,8,5,1], [3,7,9,4] ] letting cmatrix2 : matrix indexed by [ int(1..2), int(1..4) ] of int(1..10)\n= [ [2,8,5,1], [3,7,9,4] ]\nFinally new matrices may be constructed using a slice or comprehension, as in the example below where the letting is used for the table of a table constraint.\nletting xor_table = [ [a,b,c] | a : bool, b : bool, c : bool, (a /\\ b) \\/ (!a /\\ !b) <-> c ]\nfind x,y,z : bool such that table([x,y,z], xor_table)"

The domain must be finite. The example below\nfind x : int(1..10)\ndefines a single decision variable with the given domain. It is possible to define several variables in one find by giving multiple names, as follows.\nfind x,y,z : int(1..10)\nMatrices of decision variables are declared using a matrix domain, as in the following example.\nfind m : matrix indexed by [ int(1..10) ] of bool\nThis declares m as a 1-dimensional matrix of 10 boolean variables.

The information is passed on only when Minion is used as the solver. These statements are experimental and may be removed from the language in future versions.\nThe branching on statement specifies a sequence of variables for the solver to branch on. The heuristic statement specifies the heuristic used on only the variables in the branching on list. heuristic is followed by static, sdf, conflict or srf and these options are passed through to Minion.\nThe example below tells the solver to branch on w and x using the smallest domain first heuristic. It will subsequently branch on all the other decision variables using the default (static) ordering.\nfind w,x,y,z : int(1..10) branching on [w,x] heuristic sdf\nThe branching on statement is followed by a comma-separated list of individual decision variables or matrices. This list may contain matrices of different dimensions and sizes. Decision variables in matrices are enumerated in the order produced by the flatten function.\nThe branching on list may contain the same decision variable more than once. This can be useful to pick some variables from a matrix to branch on first, then include the rest of the matrix simply by including the entire matrix. In the following example the diagonal of M is branched first, then the rest of M is included.\nfind M : matrix indexed by [int(1..9), int(1..9)] of int(1..9)\nbranching on [ [ M[i,i] | i : int(1..9)], M ]\nWhen a matrix is included in the branching on list, it is converted to a one-dimensional matrix using flatten. Optimisation is only performed on the variables in the branching on list. Using branching on can cause maximising and minimising to function in an unusual way: they will only maximise or minimise on the variables in the branching on list, and therefore may not return the overall maximal/minimal solution."

      "heading" : "4 Undefinedness in ESSENCE′",
      "text" : "Since the current version of ESSENCE′ is a closed language, there are a finite set of partial functions in the language. For example, x/y is a partial function because it is not defined when y=0. In its current version ESSENCE′ implements the relational semantics as defined by Frisch and Stuckey (The Proper Treatment of Undefinedness in Constraint Languages,\nESSENCE′ Description 1.6.4\n17\nin Proc. Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming - CP 2009, pages 367-382). The relational semantics has the advantage that it can be implemented efficiently.\nThe relational semantics may be summarised as follows:\n• Any integer or matrix expression directly containing an undefined expression is itself undefined.\n• Any domain or domain expression directly containing an undefined expression is itself undefined.\n• Any statement in the preamble (find, letting etc) directly containing an undefined expression is undefined.\n• Any boolean expression that directly contains an undefined expression is false.\nInformally, the relational semantics confines the effect of an undefined expression to a small part of the problem instance (which becomes false), in many cases avoiding making the entire problem instance false.\nConsider the four examples below. Each contains a division by zero which is an undefined integer expression. In each case the division is contained in a comparison. Integer comparisons are boolean expressions.\n(x/0 = y) = false (x/0 != y) = false ! (x/0 = y) = true ! (x/0 != y) = true\nApplying the rules of the relational semantics results in each of the comparisons inside the brackets becoming false:\n(false) = false (false) = false ! (false) = true ! (false) = true\nIn the relational semantics, (x/0 != y) is not semantically equivalent to !(x/0 = y), which is somewhat counter-intuitive.\nAnother counter-intuitive case arises with matrix indexing. In the following example, the expression M[0] is undefined because 0 is not in the index domain. If the matrix is boolean (i.e. DOM is bool) then M[0] becomes false, and the model has a solution when M[1]=false. However, if the matrix contains integer variables (i.e. DOM is int(0..1)) then the constraint M[0] = M[1] becomes false and the model has no solutions.\nfind M : matrix indexed by [int(1)] of DOM such that M[0] = M[1]\nIn the SAVILE ROW implementation of ESSENCE′, all partial functions are removed in a two-step process, before any other transformations are applied. The first step is as follows. For each partial function a boolean expression is created that is true when the partial function is defined and false when it is undefined. There are six operators that may be partial: division, modulo, power, factorial, matrix indexing and matrix slicing. Table 4 shows the generated boolean expression for each operator. The boolean expression is then added to the model by connecting it (with /\\) onto the closest boolean expression above the partial function in the abstract syntax tree.\nThe second step is to replace the partial function P with a total function SP. For each input where P is defined, SP is defined to the same value. For inputs where P is undefined, SP takes a default value (typically 0 for integer expressions).\nOnce both steps have been applied to each partial function, the model is well defined everywhere. This is done first, before any other model transformations, and thus allows all subsequent transformations to be simpler because there is no need to allow for undefinedness. For example, the expression x/y=x/y may not be simplified to true, because it is false when y=0. However, after replacing the partial division function, the resulting equality can be simplified to true. In general any equality between two syntactically identical expressions can be simplified to true once there are no partial functions.\nESSENCE′ Description 1.6.4\n18"

As you would expect, operators with higher precedence are applied first.\nLeft-associative operators are evaluated left-first, for example 2/3/4 = (2/3)/4. The only operator with right associativity is **. This allows double exponentiation to have its conventional meaning: 2**3**4 = 2**(3**4)\nUnary operators usually have a higher precedence than binary ones. There is one exception to this rule: that ** has a higher precedence than unary minus. This allows -2**2**3 to have its conventional meaning of -(2**(2**3))=-256, as opposed to (-2)**(2**3)=256."
