This phenomenon has been observed, when we comprehensively studied multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) on a six benchmark instances of discrete timecost trade-off problem (DTCTP). Instead of using single algorithm to solve DTCTP, we use a portfolio approach that takes multiple algorithms as its constituent. In this paper, we proposed portfolio comprising of four MOEAs, Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm 2 (NSGA 2), the strength Pareto EA 2 (SPEA 2), Pareto archive evolutionary strategy (PAES) and Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm 2 (NPGA 2) to solve DTCTP. The result shows that the portfolio approach is computationally fast and qualitatively superior than its constituent algorithms for all benchmark instances. Moreover, portfolio approach provides an insight in selecting the best algorithm for all instances of DTCTP.\nKeywords: Time-cost trade-off, Algorithm portfolio, Multi-objective optimization.  "

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "The discrete time-cost trade-off problem (DTCTP) is an important aspect in the scheduling of construction project. In project planning and scheduling, selection of appropriate resources including crew sizes, equipment, methods and technologies to carry out a project are challenging decisions. These decisions ultimately affect the duration and cost of the project. In practice, if project is running behind the scheduled plan, acceleration of activity becomes essential by allowing additional resources which ultimately incurs additional cost (De et al., 1997). DTCTP is a process to identify a suitable activity for speeding up, and deciding “by how much” so as to attain the best possible savings in both time and cost (Zheng et al., 2005). Such optimization process includes hidden trade-off relationship between time and cost. This will create complex\nsituation for decision maker’s to predict whether the total cost (i.e., the direct and indirect costs) would increase or decrease as a result of the schedule compression.\nOver the last few decades, various approaches have been proposed to optimize time and\ncost. They can be broadly classified based on mathematical models or heuristics. Many researchers developed new mathematical models by using linear programming, integer programming or dynamic programming to solve the time-cost optimization problem (Robinson, 1975; Siemens, 1971; Goyal, 1975). Heuristic or mathematical models showed both strengths and weaknesses in solving DTCTP. The heuristic approaches select the activities to be shortened or expanded based on certain selection criteria, which do not guarantee optimal solutions. On the other hand, mathematical models require great computational effort and some approaches do not provide the optimal solution either. In addition, for large-scale networks (several hundred activities with discrete time-cost relationships, which are common for most construction projects), neither heuristic methods nor mathematical models can offer optimal solutions efficiently (Ozgen, 2009). DTCTP is known as strong NP-hard problem that failed to maintain pseudo-polynomial time guarantee for complex project network using exact solution algorithms (De et al., 1997).\nRecently, many researchers proposed various metaheuristics such as genetic algorithm\n(GA), ant colony optimization (ACO), simulated annealing (SA) etc. to solve the DTCTP for large-scale networks to obtain near-optimal Pareto solution (Ozgen, 2009; Chassiakos and Sakellaropoulos, 2005; Feng and Liu, 1997; Pour et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2004; Feng et al., 2000; Afshar et al., 2009; Mungle et al., 2013). However, it is difficult to inform in advance for decision maker which metaheuristic is the best to solve an instance of NP-hard optimization problem. Since a behavior of most metaheuristics for NP-hard problems are usually very difficult to characterize analytically and experimentally that further lead to algorithm selection problem (De et al., 1995). Previously, few attempts were made by researchers to solve algorithm selection problem for NP-hard problem by using experimental methods (Rice 1976; Guo and Hsu, 2007).\nDTCTP is a multi-objective optimization problem that attempts to strike a delicate\nbalance between project schedule time and cost. A multi-objective problem, in its real sense, requires the determination of a representative set of non-dominated or Pareto optimal solutions in the stipulated time frame to be presented to the decision maker. Last decade has witnessed a significant growth in the use of evolutionary meta-heuristics for complex multi-objective\noptimization problems (Deb, 2001). Continuous improvements in the past few years have spectacularly reduced the time of response of these meta-heuristics without much depreciation in terms of solution quality. In particular, state of the art MOEAs like Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) (Deb et al., 2002), Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm II (SPEA-II) (Zitzler et al., 2001) and Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm II (NPGA-II) (Erickson et al., 2001) etc. have been extensively used and their robustness and capability to solve complex Multi-objective Combinatorial Optimization (MOCO) problems are well established.\nThe objective of this paper is to design a portfolio of four MOEAs namely NSGA-II (Deb\net al., 2002), SPEA-II (Zitzler et al., 2001), NPGA-II (Erickson et al., 2001) and PAES (Knowles and Corne, 1999), and its implementation on DTCTP. The four MOEAs are parallelly processed on two and four processors system. In addition, average quality metric is used to evaluate the quality of the approximated Pareto-optimal front. This aids in the decision making process to investigate the relative performance of various strategies embedded in the portfolio to get an insight into the solution quality of the Pareto-optimal front with the increasing problem size and complexity. A portfolio of algorithms is formally expressed as “A collection of different algorithms and or different copies of the same algorithm running on different processors” (Gomes and Selman, 2001; Huberman et al., 1997, Brown et al., 2003). Algorithm portfolio seeks to identify the best suited strategy and thereby amalgamate the performance of various algorithms thus enhancing the algorithm performance in dynamic environment. The effect can broadly be termed as performance maximizing superposition of algorithms where an algorithm performance is tailored by the performance of counterparts embedded in the portfolio. Finally, AHP method is adapted to determine the best portfolio case for DTCTP.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the mathematical\nformulation of DTCTP. Section 3 reviews some of the terminologies and techniques employed in the field of multi-objective optimization. Section 4 presents the computational study. Section 5 presents design of algorithm portfolio and its implementation. Section 6 includes the numerical results. Finally, section 7 concludes the paper with suggested future research works."

      "heading" : "3. Basic Concepts of Multi-objective Optimization",
      "text" : "In this section, we briefly present the basic concepts of multi-objective optimization. Generally, multi-objective optimization problem can be formulated as follows:\nmaximize , … , (7) . . ∈\nWhere, solution , … , is a vector of decision variables in a problem at hand and X is the set of feasible solutions available in a search space. If the variables in a problem at hand are discrete, the multi-objective optimization problem is called multiple-objective combinatorial optimization problems. The image of a solution x in the objective space is a point\n, … , , such that 1, … , (8)    \nPoint dominates , ≻ , if ∀ and for at least one j. Solution dominates if the image of dominates the image of . A solution ∈ is considered as Pareto-optimal if there is no ∈ that dominates solution x. A point being an image of a Pareto-optimal solution is known as non-dominated point. The set of all Pareto-optimal solution is called the Pareto-optimal set. The image of the Pareto-optimal set in the objective space is called the non-dominated set or Pareto front. An approximation of the non-dominated set is a set A of feasible points (and corresponding solutions) such that , ∈ such that ≻ . The point ∗ composed of the best attainable objective function value is called the ideal point.\n∗ | ∈ , 1, … , (9) An approximation of the ideal point based on set A is denoted by Z** (A)\n∗∗ max | ∈ , 1, … , (10)\nFinding the complete Pareto front is a very difficult task computationally which is\nattributed to the presence of a large numbers of sub-optimal Pareto front. Considering an existing memory limitation, determining the complete Pareto front becomes infeasible, and thus requires the Pareto front to be diverse covering maximum possible regions of it. Therefore, a multiobjective algorithm aims to obtain an approximation of the Parent front (Jaszkiewicz, 2003).\nIn this paper, performance of algorithm portfolio is measured based on the quality of the\nobtained Pareto front, which is quantitatively evaluated using standard criteria or metrics. One such metric ‘Average Quality’ (AQ) (Jaszkiewicz, 2003) is utilized here. In past, the quality of\nthe Pareto-optimal set was measured in terms of Tchebycheff function S (Jaszkiewicz, 2003) and is defined in the following way:\n     0 0 0 ( , , ) max ( ) max ( ) j j j j\nj j jj\ns z z\nz f\n\n\n   \n \nz z\nx                                          (11)\nWhere is a reference point, ∧ , … , is a weight vector such that 0 ∀ and ∃ | 0. Each weighted Tchebycheff scalarizing function has at least one global optimum belonging to the set of Pareto-optimal solutions. Note, however, that if the optimum is not unique, then some of the optima may be dominated, but must have at least one objective component equal to a Pareto-optimal solution. For each Pareto optimal solution x there exist a weighted Tchebycheff scalarizing function S such that x is a global optimum of S.\nHowever, this function tends to hide certain aspects regarding the solution set’s quality\nbecause poor performance with respect to proximity may get compensated by good performance in distribution of solutions. In order to overcome this limitation, diversity indicators of spread and space are added to the formulation of AQ metric.\nAchievement scalarizing functions are defined in the following ways:\n 0 0 0 1\n( , , ) max , ( ) ( ) J\na j j j j j jj j S z z z z   \n    \n     zz                               (12) \nWhere ρ = small positive number, 0< ρ<<1. All global optima of each achievement scalarizing\nfunction belong to the set of Pareto-optimal solutions.\nWeight vector that meets the following condition are called normalized weight vectors.\n∀ 0, 1 13  \nThe AQ metric uses a representative sample s of normalized weight vectors which is represented as:\n∧ , … , ∈ | ∈ 0, , , … , , 1 (14)\nWhere,\ns = Set of normalized vector l = Sampling parameter We observe that s contain 1\n1 weight vectors. For each number of objectives J, the size of Ψs should at least 50 i.e., sampling parameter l is set as the lowest value that assures |Ψ| 50. Therefore l set to be 49 for J = 2. Each weight vector ∧∈ defines an achievement scalarizing function , ,∧, . All scalarizing functions defined by vectors from set Ψs constitute set Sa of functions.\nIn order to evaluate the quality of solution generated by algorithm portfolio, we first run\nthe algorithm portfolio. In result, an approximation A of the whole non-dominated set is obtained. Then for each function , ,∧, ∈ the best solution x on this function is selected from set A. i.e., ∀ ∈ , ,∧, , ,∧, . Thus the average quality of solutions generated by the portfolio is\n∑ , ,∧,∈ | | 15\nWhere, Z0 = reference point which is an approximation of the ideal point X = best solution on function , ,∧, | ∈   ρ = parameter set as 0.01\nFor each test instance, an approximation of the ideal point was found by local\noptimization of individual objectives started from an initial solution. This approximation of the\nideal point is used as reference point in achievement scalarizing function , ,∧, . The objective ranges observed during local optimization of every individual objective is used to determine the range equalization factor which further helps to normalize the objective values before calculating scalarizing function.\nThe range equalization factors (Steur, 1986) are defined in the following ways:\nΠ 1 , 1, … , 16  \nWhere, is the approximate range of objective function in the non-dominated set A.\nObjective values multiplied by the range equalization factors are called normalized objective function values."

This algorithm is a revised version of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic algorithm (NSGA) proposed by Srinivas and Deb (1995) which has been criticized mainly for its high computational complexity, non-elitism approach and a need for specifying a sharing parameter. NSGA was based on Genetic algorithm (GA), which utilizes several layers of classification of the individuals. In the slow sorting approach, in order to find the first non-dominated front each solution in the population is compared with every other to find all the members which are non-dominated compared to others. These individuals comprises first non-dominated front. To find the members of the next front, all the members of the previous fronts are left temporarily and the aforementioned procedure is repeated. This leads to a high O (MN3) computational complexity where M is the number of objectives and N is the population size.\nHowever, NSGA-II followed a fast non-dominated sorting approach which requires O\n(MN2) comparisons. It also replaced the use of sharing function with the new crowded comparison approach that eliminates the need of any user defined parameter for maintaining diversity among population members. The other basic steps of NSGA-II are same as those of GA. Initially, a population double in size (2N) is randomly generated and is then sorted on the basis of non-dominance. Thereafter, the selection of best N members from the population is carried out. Crossover and Mutation is performed in order to utilize these genetic operations to produce better offspring. The parents and offspring are then combined to form the initial population for the next generation and the aforementioned procedure is repeated. The algorithm finally provides a well distributed Pareto set of solutions. In the present paper, two point crossover and bit-flip mutation have been used."

SPEA-II, an improved version of SPEA, utilizes an external memory for storing the non-dominated individuals. Each individual in the extended memory as well as in the current population is assigned a strength value based on the domination and density information. The rank value of an individual is determined by the summation of strength values of the individuals that dominate it. Density of each individual is estimated based on the kth nearest neighbor density estimation method. The final fitness value is then calculated as the sum of rank and density values. In addition, a hierarchical clustering based method (Morse, 1980) is adopted for the pruning of the external archive thereby maintaining diversity in the obtained Pareto front."

However, an interesting aspect of this algorithm is the procedure used to maintain diversity which consists of a crowding procedure that divides objective space in a recursive manner. Each solution is placed in a certain grid location based on the values of its objectives (which are used as its “coordinates’’ or “geographical location’’). A map of such grid is maintained, indicating the number of solutions\nthat reside in each grid location.

In addition, it is often impossible to obtain an analytical prediction of either the solution achievable within a given computation time or the time taken to find a solution of a given quality. The analysis of these measures is critical for the comparison between MOEAs. In literature, statistical analysis of these measures is known as “Univariate Model” (Chiarandini et al., 2007). More specifically, Univariate model is the one in which either the solution cost or runtime is taken into consideration while analyzing the various metaheuristics.\nIn this paper, our concern is run-time that means computation time is measured when a\nsolution with a desired property is found. We assume that run-time corresponds to the number of iteration needed to achieve the desired solution quality.\nThe performance measure X (run-time) of a metaheuristics on the instances can be\ndescribed by a probability distribution function   or equivalently by its cumulative (discrete) distribution function (CDF) ∑ In the computational experiments, we observe data , , … ,   and then calculate the CDF. Once the CDF is known, parameter such as mean and variance of the iterations is calculated to compare the performance of each MOEA.\nInitiation of the experiment takes place by testing the four MOEAs on all the benchmark\ninstances for 50 trials and the results have been reported in Figures 1-6. In Figure 1-6, X-axis represents the iterations needed to satisfy the termination criteria and Y-axis represents the CDF value.

Moreover, it is important to compare the number of success amongst the 50 trials for each MOEA to reach the termination criteria. Figures 1-6 reveals that the performance of the all four MOEAs remained competitive for the six benchmark instances considered. More specifically, for problem 1, 3 and 4 PAES perform well compared to other three MOEA. For problem 2 and 5, NSGA-II performs well compared to other three MOEAs."

In this paper, we developed three portfolio cases, namely, 2 Algorithm-2 Processor (2A-2P), 2 Algorithm-4 Processor (2A-4P) and 4 Algorithm-4 Processor (4A-4P) (See Table 3). We then identified the constituent algorithm for each of these portfolio cases, as given in Table 3. When choosing the constituent algorithm, an intuition is that they should be more or less complementary. The constituent algorithms are combined and placed in portfolio based on their performances on all benchmark problems. As will be shown in our numerical results interpretation, choosing complementary constituent algorithms leads to good performances with same algorithms exploit on the different parallel processors on the same benchmark problems. More specifically, the\nconstituent algorithms should not only employ different operators but also exhibit different behaviors on problem sets. For second steps, algorithm portfolio framework should be highly capable to accommodate existing algorithms. However, due to the fact that some existing algorithms might have their own configuration, they merit little bit attention when incorporated into portfolio framework. In the present portfolio, some algorithms such as NSGA-II are highly capable to provide good solution quality beside its more run time complexity. This helps respective portfolio terminates quickly if the status of solution has reached predefined termination criteria.\nIn this paper, the termination criteria for the each portfolio run was set to be the\nperformance level within 10% of the best obtained AQ (average quality) metric value. Average quality (AQ) is used as standard criteria here to measure the quality of the obtained Pareto front of algorithm portfolio. More details of this issue are given in section 3. In final step of algorithm portfolio, number of iterations will be recorded after the termination criterion is satisfied. Number of iterations is taken as criteria to evaluate the computational efficiency of the each portfolio case.\nBefore running portfolio, part of our work is to allocate population size, generation size\nand other parameters values for each constituent algorithms of portfolio. Their values should be always same to evaluate the performances of each portfolio case.\n   6. Results and Discussion In order to perform the analysis, six benchmark instances are considered with varying problem size and complexity. Simulations were performed with various combinations of algorithms and processor systems. The algorithm combinations embedded in different portfolio cases is given in Table 3. Various combinations of algorithms are implemented in parallel on 2 and 4 processor systems which are detailed in coming subsection. These combinations or portfolios are represented by a ‘/’ notation. For example, the symbol 1/1 represents 2 algorithm-2 processor portfolio where first algorithm is run on first processor whiles the other one on the second processor. Similarly, 4/0/0/0 represents 4 algorithms-4 processor portfolios in which four copies of the first algorithm (Table 3) were run on all the four processors.

Generally processor availability for the parallel runs is limited in an organization; hence the selection strategy has to be executed separately for each of the two types of systems (2 Processor, 4 Processor) under consideration. The varying performance of different algorithms, and eventually the portfolios, poses enough challenge to select the best strategy among the instances explored in order to get the quality solution with minimum risk. Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) has long been utilized as a tool to decision makers for selecting the best alternative from the given alternatives in such situations. AHP employs hierarchical pairwise comparison to induce the weights of alternatives thorough their pairwise comparison.\nThis paper also addresses the selection of best portfolio problem from an AHP\nperspective.

In this case, OBJij symbolizes the average number of generation required by the particular test alternative.\nThereafter a priority matrix i  is calculated for each attribute i, where\nijijk ik a a                                                                                           (19)\n  The associated weight vector iW is then calculated for each attribute i by taking\ngeometric mean for the row corresponding to matrix Ωi\n                                                                  1 { } i i jW w                                                               \n  ijk k\n\n                                                                          (20)  \nThe calculation of weight vector is followed by their normalization, thus,  normalized\npriority vector sPV are obtained as\n1\ni ji j i jj w PV w                                                                                     (21)\n \nThe weighted sum of six priority vectors is now obtained that gives the relative rank\nvector RV for the alternatives. Here, priority weights are taken as 1/6 to ensure equal weightage to all attributes. For the two processor system, 8 portfolio combinations (due to repeat of several portfolios) have been evaluated. Similarly for four processor systems 16 combinations corresponding to both 2 algorithm and 4 algorithm cases are evaluated.\nThe final rank vectors and ranks for different alternatives are provided in Tables 5, 6 and\n7. As is evident, the aforementioned strategy provides a relative ranking between the various portfolio alternatives available. For the two algorithms with two processors system the portfolios comprising of algorithms NSGA-II and PAES characterized by (1/1) system is found to be the best. One of the possible reasons for this might be the complementary performance of both the algorithms on the problem scenario considered. As is evident from the individual performance profiles (Figures 1-6), in general, the performance of PAES was good for on all instances considered. On the contrary, the performance of NSGA-II was good for large and medium sized instances while considerably poor for the small sized problem. The results obtained with portfolios embedding NSGA-II are generally better thereby supporting our early assumptions for its increased number in the portfolios considered. It is also evident that NPGA-II, which performed poorly when considered individually, continued the show with the portfolios embedding it resulting in worst case performance.\nalgorithms NSGA-II and PAES characterized by (2/2) system is found to be the best. From result, it is clear that running algorithm on parallel processor is also found to be the best strategy when harmonizing portfolio. Similarly for the four algorithms case, the portfolio comprising of algorithms NSGA-II and PAES characterized by (3/1/0/0) system is found to be the best suited strategy.\nIn fact, the finding is attributed to the element of randomness inherited in the search\nprocedure. Randomness here does not mean uncertainty rather it refers to the ability of the heuristic to vary its performance based on the initial random seed. However, the reason can be deduced on the basis of performance profiles obtained with the single processor system (Figures 1-6).\nempirically suggestive of the aforementioned fact. Similar other interesting and supporting conclusions (for portfolio implementation) can be drawn from the analysis. However, before the implementation of this concept to the practical scenario a much detailed experimentation is required. This comprises of a much exhaustive list of algorithms and an augmented use of processors."

      "text" : "This paper proposes a portfolio approach to algorithm selection for discrete time-cost trade-off problem in multi-objective environment. The proposed algorithm portfolio containing NSGA-II, PAES, NPGA-II and SPEA-II is used to minimize the associated risk related to the selection of algorithm. Six benchmark instances of DTCTP of varying dimension and complexities are included to analyze the performances of portfolio approach. The four algorithms are parallelly processed on two and four processors system. The results showed an insight, suggesting the application of portfolios to select the best algorithm for computationally expensive multi-\nobjective optimization problems. Furthermore, the result shows a considerable decrease in the computational time by the parallel processing of algorithms.\nAs perspective for future work, much detailed analysis is needed prior to any suggestion\nfor algorithm portfolio usage. However, our preliminary results are encouraging new directions for implementation of algorithm portfolio on different multi-objective decision making problems."

This phenomenon has been observed, when we comprehensively studied multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) on a six benchmark instances of discrete timecost trade-off problem (DTCTP). Instead of using single algorithm to solve DTCTP, we use a portfolio approach that takes multiple algorithms as its constituent. In this paper, we proposed portfolio comprising of four MOEAs, Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm 2 (NSGA 2), the strength Pareto EA 2 (SPEA 2), Pareto archive evolutionary strategy (PAES) and Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm 2 (NPGA 2) to solve DTCTP. The result shows that the portfolio approach is computationally fast and qualitatively superior than its constituent algorithms for all benchmark instances. Moreover, portfolio approach provides an insight in selecting the best algorithm for all instances of DTCTP.",
