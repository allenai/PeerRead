{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Adversarial examples for generative models", "abstract": "We explore methods of producing adversarial examples on deep generative models such as the variational autoencoder (VAE) and the VAE-GAN. Deep learning architectures are known to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, but previous work has focused on the application of adversarial examples to classification tasks. Deep generative models have recently become popular due to their ability to model input data distributions and generate realistic examples from those distributions. We present three classes of attacks on the VAE and VAE-GAN architectures and demonstrate them against networks trained on MNIST, SVHN and CelebA. Our first attack leverages classification-based adversaries by attaching a classifier to the trained encoder of the target generative model, which can then be used to indirectly manipulate the latent representation. Our second attack directly uses the VAE loss function to generate a target reconstruction image from the adversarial example. Our third attack moves beyond relying on classification or the standard loss for the gradient and directly optimizes against differences in source and target latent representations. We also motivate why an attacker might be interested in deploying such techniques against a target generative network.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "After the rebuttal:\n\nThe paper contains an interesting set of results (mainly produced after the initial submission), but novelty is limited, and presentation is suboptimal. \n\nFor me now the biggest problem now is that the title and the content do not correspond.

If it were the case, wouldn't it imply that training \"against\" adversarial examples should easily make a classifier robust to adversarial examples (if they all have a telltale noise)?  \n\nPros: \n  -The question of whether adversarial examples exist in generative models, and indeed how the definition of \"adversarial example\" carries over is an interesting one.  \n  -Finding that a certain type of generative model *doesn't have* adversarial examples would be a really significant result, finding that generative models have adversarial examples would also be a worth negative result.  \n  -The adversarial examples in figures 5 and 6 seem convincing, though they seem much more overt and noisy than the adversarial examples on MNIST shown in (Szegedy 2014).  Is this because it's actually harder to find adversarial examples in these types of generative models?  \n\nIssues: \n  -Paper is significantly over length at 13 pages.  \n  -The beginning of the paper should more clearly motivate its purpose.  \n  -Paper has \"generative models\" in the title but as far as I can tell the whole paper is concerned with autoencoder-type models.  This is kind of annoying because if someone wanted to consider adversarial attacks on, say, autoregressive models, they might be unreasonably burdened by having to explain how they're distinct from a paper called \"adversarial examples for generative models\".  \n   -I think that the introduction contains too much background information - it could be tightened.  \n", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 6, "DATE": "22 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 3}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer2", "TITLE": "Review", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper considers different methods of producing adversarial examples for generative models such as VAE and VAEGAN. Specifically, three methods are considered: classification-based adversaries which uses a classifier on top of the hidden code, VAE loss which directly uses the VAE loss and the \"latent attack\" which finds adversarial perturbation in the input so as to match the latent representation of a target input.\n\nI think the problem that this paper considers is potentially useful and interesting to the community. To the best of my knowledge this is the first paper that considers adversarial examples for generative models. As I pointed out in my pre-review comments, there is also a concurrent work of \"Adversarial Images for Variational Autoencoders\" that essentially proposes the same \"latent attack\" idea of this paper with both L2 distance and KL divergence.\n\nNovelty/originality: I didn't find the ideas of this paper very original. All the proposed three attacks are well-known and standard methods that here are applied to a new problem and this paper does not develop *novel* algorithms for attacking specifically *generative models*. However I still find it interesting to see how these standard methods compare in this new problem domain.\n\nThe clarity and presentation of the paper is very unsatisfying. The first version of the paper proposes the \"classification-based adversaries\" and reports only negative results. In the second set of revisions, the core idea of the paper changes and almost an entirely new paper with a new co-author is submitted and the idea of \"latent attack\" is proposed which works much better than the \"classification-based adversaries\". However, the authors try to keep around the materials of the first version, which results in a 13 page long paper, with different claims and unrelated set of experiments. \"in our attempts to be thorough, we have had a hard time keeping the length down\" is not a valid excuse.\n\nIn short, the paper is investigating an interesting problem and apply and compare standard adversarial methods to this domain, but the novelty and the presentation of the paper is limited.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 5, "DATE": "20 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer1", "TITLE": "Final review", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "\nAfter the rebuttal:\n\nThe paper contains an interesting set of results (mainly produced after the initial submission), but novelty is limited, and presentation is suboptimal. \n\nFor me now the biggest problem now is that the title and the content do not correspond.
