      "text" : "Instant messengers (IMs) have become an integral part of today’s state of the art communication system with the latest gizmos, smartphones, tablets, laptops etc., becoming affordable and gaining popularity globally. Instant messaging initially started off as a chatting service between buddies, then gradually evolved into the most sought after and popular mode of communication. Ever since the Instant Messengers (IMs) were introduced viz., ICQ (I seek you), Internet Relay Chat (IRC), Microsoft’s MSN Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, Google Talk, etc. the user response they got was overwhelming [1]. Now IMs like Skype, WhatsApp and the likes of them have made their mark in the communication world with their popularity. With the enormous increase in scale of the IM’s usage globally, it is highly desirous to make these services secure and reliable. It has been found that many security challenges do exist viz., most of the freeware IM programs do not have encryption capabilities, password management is not strong and have vulnerability to account spoofing and denial- of-service (DoS) attacks [1]. There\nwas some reprieve when spam detection and filtering were introduced to the IMs [2]. But the most challenging issue being encountered is the detection and prevention of phishing in instant messengers as the existing fire walls available are not at all capable of detecting such attacks. With the large number of additional features available in the Instant Messengers, the potential areas for attack have also increased, as there are no concrete methodologies to counter Phishing attacks. This could lead to a profound effect on a phishing victim as he or she loses the trust in internet banking and e-commerce transactions by falling prey into disclosing confidential account details to the phisher’s devious tricks. The consequences of such phishing attacks will have disastrous impact on the corporate and banking sectors and businesses which rely heavily on the internet, as the e-clients would lose their trust in the services owing to their vulnerabilities.\nThe term phishing is derived from fishing wherein fishers use a bait to do fishing. Here the attacker i.e. the phisher uses some socially engineered messages to perform phishing i.e. elicits personal information deceitfully from the unsuspecting victims through emails, instant messengers, websites, social networking medium etc. [3]. There were about 1,23,486 phishing attacks reported in the second half of 2012 and around 72,758 attacks reported worldwide in the first half of 2013 as analyzed by the Global Phishing survey 1H2013 [53] of the Anti-Phishing Work Group (APWG) [4]. Consider for instance a phisher tries to trick the unsuspecting victims to login to the fake website page and elicits confidential information, usually in online banking and e-commerce sectors though emails. In instant messengers, the phisher pretends to be a trust worthy chat mate and asks personal questions in order to figure out security details of bank accounts like passwords, codes, etc. from the unsuspecting victim. Even though active research has been done on phishing detection in websites, emails and social networking sites, research contributions found in Instant messengers are limited. There are no robust techniques developed to tackle the problem of phishing dynamically, although there are some techniques, where phishing detection is static in nature.\nData mining approaches were used to find the frequent phishing patterns and extract phishing rules on a larger scale in IMs but ultimately, the detected phishing words had larger percentage of false positives and false negatives. This was obvious as the entire detection process was content based and it failed to detect the threat activity pertaining to the phishing domain.\nEven though in some IM systems, Association rule mining was used along with domain\nontologies, which were applied right from information extraction and mapping them with predefined phishing rules to identify the phishing domains, still it could not detect the phishing words intelligently, as the main intention or context behind its usage could not be identified. But its performance was slightly better than those not using domain ontologies.\nAvoiding ambiguity over the relevance of the identified phishing words is the main motive behind this work in order to enhance the instant messaging system performance. This could be done by identifying the context behind chatting messages in order to reduce the percentage of both false positives and false negatives.\nThe extracted domain and its context if mined together can generate more interesting phishing rules by using Classification Based on Association (CBA) rules, in order to generate instant phishing alerts dynamically for the victim, with the best possible performance i.e. maximum true positives percentage.\nThe paper is organized into 6 sections. Section 2 discusses the related work of prevalent phishing problems in Instant Messengers, the methodologies and approaches used to address the problem statement. Section 3 elaborates the architecture and design of the PDS methodology and discusses\nthe architecture of OBIE for domain and context extraction using the Triplet Algorithms. Section 4 characterizes the phishing features so as to formulate its terminology apart from framing the pre-defined phishing rules based on key attributes. The application of Classification Based Association rules on the training datasets and test dataset to generate phishing rules is also discussed. Section 5 outlines the experimental setup to be established in the form of chat session transactions between chatters of IMs and addresses the implementation and testing of the Phishing detection system in IMs and evaluates the performance in terms of precision and recall. Section 6 summarizes and highlights the contributions of this research work in precise. It also provides directions for future enhancements in this research area."

      "text" : "Phishing detection in the past has not been dynamic i.e. pre-defined blacklisted phishing words were used for matching and could not detect the zero-hour phishing attacks, which is critical from the detection accuracy point of view. Also, when there is increase in the false positives the system would be more harmful rather than being useful, as the users will start ignoring the system warnings due to wrongly reported phishing alerts [3].\nAll the previously detected phishing words, URLs and IP addresses are listed and updated from time to time and stored as blacklists. These blacklists cannot provide protection from the zerohour phishing attacks i.e. the phishing words or URLs which are not available in the blacklists previously. It took about 12 hours to detect and blacklist the new phishing words or URLs, which is a considerable delay owing to the fact that about two-thirds of the phishing attacks end within two hours [21]. Thus protection from zero-hour phishing attacks was not available. Google Safe Browsing API, DNS-based Blacklist (DNSBL), PhishNet are the examples of services using the blacklists. To overcome this problem, phishing heuristics i.e. experience based methods of problem solving were used like SpoofGuard, Phishguard, Phishwish, and Cantina [3].\nData mining techniques like association rule mining (ARM), classification and clustering have also been used to detect phishing through algorithms like Apriori, C4.5, Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). Apriori algorithm is used for finding phishing patterns dynamically in Instant messengers from not only text messages but also from voice chatting, by integrating the IM system with speech recognition system [28]. This is purely a content based phishing detection system with increased FPs. Phishing detection in emails using C4.5 decision tree induction was done in [30] based on the highest information entropy, but it could not determine the phishing threat type.\nAdvanced classification method like Fuzzy Set Approach has been used efficiently by Maher et al. [32] to detect phishing websites in the E-banking sector. The intelligent fuzzy-based classification system also uses associative classification algorithms to detect phishing websites in the e-banking, and extracts the phishing features and classifies them into phishing rules with a layered structure [32].\nAssociative Classification (AC) uses CBA, CMAR, and CPAR to generate classifier rules, but the according to [16], the Classification based on associations (CBA) was more accurate than the C4.5 on large number of datasets. The iterative approach of Apriori is used by the CBA to create a classifier [16]. This AC approach has been used in [32] along with fuzzy based scheme for detection of phishing websites but nowhere for phishing detection in instant messengers.\nIn the above discussions phishing detection has been surveyed to a large extent in emails, URLs\nand websites but it has been observed that very less efforts have been made in the phishing detection in instant messengers. The purpose of studying the types of phishing approaches in emails, URLs and websites is to understand the extent of the research progress made in the three communication methods and how much progress remains to be achieved in instant messengers. The main observation here is that even though the zero-hour phishing detection was dynamic, but still there was no considerable decline in the false positives and the false negatives, as all these phishing detection approaches including phishing heuristics and data mining algorithms were content based methodologies.\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) [47] techniques play a crucial role in overcoming the shortcomings mentioned above, by giving the advantage of utilizing the semantics of the messages exchanged between chatters in instant messaging. The Semantic Web uses the ontology and could incorporate the NLP to extract triplets i.e. subject, predicate and the object of the message under process, as a part of Ontology Based Information Extraction (OBIE). During the research study it has been observed that NLP has not been utilized to its full potential and at times it has only been used as an alternative to information extraction.\nAnother frame work which detects suspicious messages in Instant messengers and social networking sites using Ontology and Association Rule Mining (ARM) is used to detect the domain of the message keywords [33]. Pre-defined phishing rules have been considered which are to be mapped with the ontology generator through NLP, to obtain the domain of the suspected word. The user is not alerted instead the e-crime department is notified if any suspicious activity is detected [33]. The overall detection is content based and thus in spite of using the NLP, the context part is not explored, the use of ontology is restricted to information extraction and domain identification only. The overall performance does not reduce the false positives and false negatives."

      "text" : "The PDS monitoring system performs its task in two phases:\n• Data pre-processing to extract domain and context using ontology (OBIE). • Applying CBA and generate useful association rules\nIn the first phase the PDS monitoring system captures and stores the instant messages in the Message DB (MDB) and then performs pre-processing on it through OBIE to identify the Domain and Context of the probable phishing word.\nData pre-processing to extract domain and context using ontology (OBIE):\nThe pre-processing includes removal of stop words and stemming.\nStop Words Removal: From each instant message, stop words i.e. words that are not significant are removed, i.e. prepositions, conjunctions, articles, adjectives, adverbs, etc. [36]. Stop word examples are: from, into, in, for, while, a, an, the, that, these, those, under, over, about, although, how, what, when, who, whom, etc. Indexing cannot be used on stop words and the removal of these words improves the efficiency of retrieval.\nStemming is performed to reduce the derived or inflected words to their stem i.e. to its basic or root form. It is also referred to as conflation. Programs which perform stemming are called as stemmers or stemming algorithms [35]. Also stemming derives the stem morphologically from a completely suffixed word [34]. A stemmer identify the string \"fishing\", \"fisher\", \"fishery\", “fished” etc. based on the root \"fish\". The extracted keywords after pre-processing i.e. removing stop words and stemming are stored in the Filter Word DB (FWDB).\nDomain identification: After stemming is performed all the keywords obtained are in machine understandable form, which are to be mapped with the ontology to determine their respective domains through the OBIE. For the domain identification the first step is to use the Triplet Extraction Algorithm to extract the subject, predicate and object from the keywords. The NLP approach used here identifies a subject and maps it to a semantic class. It uses the predicate and object as name and value of the attribute respectively [12].\nThe next step is to identify the theme concept for which the concepts are to be extracted first. Concepts are the extracted tokens which are tagged as nouns and form the Concept set. The subjects identified above are populated into the subjectList. The concept which occurs the most number of times forms the MaxOccurConcepts. Identifying the Theme concept is done by performing the intersection of the three sets obtained [12].\nMathematically, Concept = [nouns] subjectList = [subjects] MaxOccurConcepts = [concepts] ThemeConcept = concept ∩ subjectList ∩ MaxOccurConcepts [12] Consider the following text passage: “Hotel Taj Banjara at Banjara Hills offersv excellent facilities and accommodation. Comprising of 4 blocks and 68 deluxe rooms, Taj Banjara offers a pleasant stay.” Concepts = {Hotel, Taj Banjara, Banjara Hills, facilities, accommodation, blocks, rooms, stay}\nMathematically, Concept = { nouns }\nsubjectList = {Taj Banjara} subjectList = {subjects} MaxOccurConcepts = {Taj Banjara (2)} ThemeConcept = {Taj Banjara} Themeconcept = Concept ∩ subjectList ∩ MaxOccurConcepts Taj Banjara is identified as the theme concept\nNow the Domain class can be identified by the mapping to the string Theme concept by using one of the two applicable rules: Explicit mention rule and the Implicit rule. Explicit mention rule suggests that the string which are the class names themselves. As far as the Implicit rule is concerned, it is used when there is no string match suggesting that the domain ontology lexicon. Domain ontologies are formed by experienced experts of the relevant domain. Semantic lexicons are created related to the respective domains, which is then used to identify the domain which the\nmessage content refers [12].\nIn the example the string Taj Banjara refers explicitly to hotel, and thus Taj Banjara belongs to hotel instance and the domain identified is hotel.\nContext identification: This is an enhancement to the concepts discussed from [12] where in the task was limited to domain identification. The main contribution in this work is to identify the context or intention of the instant messages exchanged between chatters. The phishing detection may be misleading if phishing alerts are generated for harmless words, which are unintentional. This may leave a bad impression on the chatter to ignore such alerts again and again. Consider for example a message “Joe is so fond of chocolates. He would kill anybody for a bar of chocolate.” Any phishing detection system would raise an alert for the word “kill”, when actually its use is harmless. Extracting the true context is the main objective of this work apart from getting the least values for the false positives and false negatives.\nIn continuation to the previous discussion a new predicateList is introduced.\nConcepts = {Joe, chocolate, bar} Mathematically, Concept = {nouns} subjectList = {chocolate} subjectList = {subjects} predicateList = {fond, kill} MaxOccurConcepts = {chocolate (2)} ThemeConcept = {chocolate} Themeconcept = Concept ∩ subjectList ∩ MaxOccurConcepts “chocolate” is identified as the theme concept\nIt is found that domain for the theme concept “chocolate” does not exist in the domain ontology lexicon and comes under the Implicit rule. Thus a new Domain ontology for “eatables” is formed by experienced experts of the relevant domain using the classes, attributes and relation present in the ontology. New semantic lexicons (only a few a listed) have been created related to the “eatables” domain.\nEatables domain lexicon = {eat, dark chocolate, bar, nutty, lick, munch, kill, fond}\nNote that, the words “kill” and “fond” are also included in the semantic lexicon of the domain “eatables”, as they were a part of the predicateList. The new domain is mapped with the existing domains in the Pre-defined phishing rules DB (PRDB).\nIf a match occurs Context = {harmful} or else Context = {harmless}.\nIn the above example context = “harmless” in spite of the predicate or the verb being “kill”. The implementation of the context is possible with very simple sentences containing single values for the triplets.\nThe filtered keyword dataset in the FWDB, along with attribute values of Domain ontology and the Context forms the Test dataset for the generation of classification association rules (CAR) using CBA.\nApplying CBA and generate useful association rules:\nThe Classifier Based Association (CBA) method explores all the associations between attribute values and their classes in the training dataset in order to build large classifiers. The training data set used here is the pre-defined phishing rules table shown in Table 1.\nThe pre-defined phishing rules are framed by experts of the relevant domain having tremendous experience. The training dataset (snapshot) for the Classification Based Association rules is shown including the threshold values, Domain Ontology and its context. With the testing dataset rules are generated to predict the Phishing words and subsequently raising the phishing alert. If a new phishing word is identified based on threshold values based on frequently occurring words during chatting or a new phishing domain is discovered, these phishing words are appended to the Phishing Word DB (PWDB)."

Images, sounds and videos are the formats which need a lot of work other than text formats where the vulnerability towards phishing may always be present.\nThe following issues and challenges are therefore identified where lot of research activities should be concentrated.\n• Deceptive phishing messages are sent in any format other than textual (Images, Audio, Video), then they are not detected.\n• Rules lack multilingual support for deceptive phishing detection. • Issue with the interpretation of a message written in multiple languages."

It is required to create technical awareness in users by educating them to create a phishing detection application which would generate phishing alerts for the user so that phishing messages are not ignored. The lack of basic security features to detect and prevent phishing has had a profound effect on the IM clients, as they lose their faith in e-banking and e-commerce transactions, which will have a disastrous impact on the corporate and banking sectors and businesses which rely heavily on the internet. Very little research contributions were available in for phishing detection in Instant messengers. A context based, dynamic and intelligent phishing detection methodology in IMs is proposed, to analyze and detect phishing in Instant Messages with relevance to domain ontology (OBIE) and utilizes the Classification based on Association (CBA) for generating phishing rules and alerting the victims. A PDS Monitoring system algorithm is used to identify the phishing activity during exchange of messages in IMs, with high ratio of precision and recall. The results have shown improvement by the increased percentage of precision and recall when compared to the existing methods.",
