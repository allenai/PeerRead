      "text" : "Given some object of interest marked in one frame of a video, the goal of single-object tracking is to locate this object in subsequent video frames, despite object motion, changes in the camera’s viewpoint, and other incidental environmental variations such as lighting and shadows.\nSingle-object tracking finds applications in many important scenarios. For autonomous driving, a tracker must follow dynamic objects in order to estimate how they are moving and predict where they will end up in the future. For security applications, a surveillance camera must track numerous people as they move through the environments.\nCNNs have recently had great success in significantly advancing the state-of-the-art on challenging computer vision tasks such as image classification [22, 15, 33], object detection [10], semantic segmentation [25], and many others [4, 38, 39, 19]. Such great success of CNNs is mostly attributed to their outstanding performance in representing spatial information, often identified from collections of unrelated, discrete image frames.\nVisual tracking, however, has seen less success using this line of attack since it is often difficult to learn a robust spatial and temporal representation for continuous video data. Recently, some initial works have been done in using neural networks for visual tracking, and these efforts have produced some impact and improved state-of-the-art accuracy [29, 41, 40]. Although these methods may be sufficient to predict a target’s bounding box locations, these classification-based approaches could be limited in learning robust tracking features and maximizing long-term tracking performance without taking temporal coherency and correlation into account. That is, training algorithms specialized for long-term visual tracking is still not fully explored.\nTo fully exploit the spatial and temporal information in videos for visual tracking, it is then desirable to add continuous, recurrent links to augment discrete, convolutional links and use a reinforcement algorithm to maximize tracking performance in the long run. Here, we propose a novel framework which processes sequential video frames as a whole and directly outputs location predictions of the target object in each frame. Our model integrates convolutional network with recurrent network (Figure 1), and builds up an internal representation of the video. It fuses past recurrent memories with current visual features to make\n1\nar X\niv :1\n70 1.\n08 93\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 3\n1 Ja\nn 20\npredictions of the target object’s location over time. We describe an end-to-end optimization procedure that allows the model to be trained to maximize tracking performance in the long run. This procedure uses backpropagation to train the neural-network components and REINFORCE algorithm [42] to train the policy network.\nOur algorithm augments traditional CNN with a recurrent convolutional model learning temporal representations and an RL unit making optimal tracking decisions. The main contributions of our work are:\n• We propose a convolutional recurrent neural network model, which learns robust spatial representations in each single frame and temporal representations cross multiple frames. The learned features better capture temporal information in video and can be directly applied in a tracking problem.\n• Our framework is trained end-to-end with deep RL algorithms, in which the model is optimized to maximize a tracking performance measure which depends on the entire video sequence.\n• Our model is trained fully off-line. This off-line training strategy is advantageous in test time, as there is no need to fine-tune the system online to gain efficiency.\n• We have validated our algorithms by comparing with an existing neural-network based method and perform-\ning rigorous experiments on artificial video sequences to demonstrate both the validity and applicability.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. We first review related work in Section 2, and discuss our RL approach for visual tracking in Section 3. Section 4 describes our end-to-end optimization algorithm, and Section 5 demonstrates the experimental results."

      "text" : "Visual Tracking is a fundamental problem in computer vision and has been actively studied for decades. Many methods have been proposed for single-object tracking. For a systematic review and comparison, we refer the readers to a recent benchmark and a tracking challenge report [43, 21]. Generally speaking, most existing trackers belong to either one of two categories: generative trackers and discriminative trackers. Generative methods describe the target appearances using generative models and search for candidate image regions that fit the model best. Some representative methods are based on principal component analysis [32], and sparse representation [26, 44]. On the other hand, discriminative trackers learn to separate the foreground from the background using a classifier. Many advanced machine learning algorithms have been used, including online boosting [11, 12], structured output SVM [14], and multiple-\ninstance learning [2]. However, almost all existing appearance-based tracking methods rely on low-level, hand-crafted features which are incapable of capturing semantic information of the targets, not robust to significant appearance changes, and only have limited discriminative power."

[22] brought significant performance improvement in image classification by training a deep CNN on ImageNet dataset [6]. Region CNN [10] applied a CNN to an object detection task, which can accurately locate and classify objects in natural images.\nDespite the impressive success of CNNs applied to still images, the application of deep neural network (DNN) models in visual tracking is not fully explored. Although DNN trackers have improved the state-of-the-art, only a limited number of tracking algorithms using representations from CNNs have been proposed so far [9, 18, 24, 41, 40, 16, 29]. An early tracking algorithm transferred CNNs pretrained on a large-scale dataset constructed for image classification [41]. Although [24] proposed an online learning method based on a pool of CNNs, its accuracy is not particularly better than that of the methods based on hand-crafted features. A recent approach [29] trained a multi-domain neural network and achieved great performance improvement. Unfortunately, existing DNN-based trackers are either very slow at test time due to intensive computational overhead, or they don’t effectively leverage cross-frame information in training videos and thus result in bad performance. Our tracker explores temporal information through an RNN and can run very efficiently by performing only a forward pass at run time."

The standard RNN cell consists of an input, a hidden and an output layer as illustrated in Figure 2.\nBesides traditional RNN, the application of recurrent networks with sophisticated hidden units, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [17] or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) [5], has become common in recent years. Mnih et al. [27] applied LSTM in visual attention problems by training a decision making network, which sufficiently improves computational efficiency for computer vision tasks. In recent works, Donahue et al.

The underlying model that RL learns is a Markov Decision Process (MDP): An agent interacts with the environment and selects an action. Applying the action at a single state, and the environment emits a new state and a reward signal. In order to maximize the expected rewards in long term, the agent learns the best policy to take actions [36].\nSome works in computer vision literature and elsewhere e.g., [1, 3, 7, 31, 28, 27] have embraced vision as a sequential decision task. RL is capable of solving sequential decision making tasks especially with the help of good environment representations learned by DNN models. Some recent works included training an RL agent to play Atari games from raw input pixels [28], and a recurrent visual attention model [27] to reduce computation for computer vision tasks. Our work is similar to the attention model described in [27], but we designed our own network architecture especially for solving the visual tracking problem by combining CNN, RNN and RL algorithms.\nOur work formulates visual tracking as a sequential decision making process and leverages RL to solve this problem. We describe an end-to-end optimization procedure that allows the model to be trained directly with respect to a visual tracking task and to maximize a long-term tracking performance measure which depends on the entire sequence of predictions made by the model. We will describe our framework in detail in next section."

At each point in time, the agent observes the environment and extracts representative features from observations. Since the agent only observes one image frame at a time, it needs to integrate information over time in order to determine how to take actions most effectively. At each step, the agent receives a scalar reward which depends on its actions, and the goal of the agent is to maximize the total long-term rewards. In our system, the agent is built around an RNN as shown in Figure 1. At each time step, it processes the input frame,\nintegrates information over time, and chooses how to act correspondingly.\nIn more detail, the proposed deep RL agent consists of three components: the feature extractor (processes input frame and generates feature representations), the memory component (integrates information overtime and formulates and updates the internal state) and the RL unit (chooses how to act and maximizes the overall reward). These are described blow."

The extracted features are denoted as:\nit = fi(xt;Wi) (1)\nwhere it is a function of xt given parameters Wi, and the functional relationship is defined by fi.\nThe same feature extractor will be applied to every single frame in an video, thus the feature extractor has to be generic enough to capture representative features for different objects in different contexts. Given varying tracking tasks, the feature extractor can either be pre-trained, transferred from other models, or initialized and trained from scratch. To make the generic extractor adaptive over time, its parametersWi will continue to be updated during end-toend training which provides better descriptors to maximize the overall rewards."

The variance of the Gaussian is fixed and decided by our experiments, while the mean value µ = fl(ht;Wl) is the output of the RL unit. Given different tracking tasks, the output of the RL unit can either be the center of a target object (xt, yt), a circle (xt, yt, rt) centered at (xt, yt) with radius rt or a rectangular bounding box (xt, yt, wt, ht) whose top left corner is (xt, yt) and width and height are wt and ht respectively.\nDuring training, the agent will receive a reward signal rt from the environment after executing an action at time t. In this work, the scalar reward signal is defined as follows:\nrt = −avg(|lt − gt|)−max(|lt − gt|) (4)\nwhere lt is the location outputted by RL unit, gt is the target ground truth at time t, avg(·) computes the mean value of a given matrix and max(·) computes the maximum value.\nThe training objective is to maximize the sum of the reward signal: R = ∑T t=1 rt. By definition, the reward in Equation 4 measures the closeness between predicted location lt and ground-truth location gt. Our training algorithm is designed to maximize R towards 0 such that both average and maximum errors made by the deep RL agent is minimized. We will discuss training details in the next section."

      "text" : "Our deep RL agent is parameterized by W = {Wi,Wh,Wl} and we aim to learn these parameters to maximize the total tracking reward the agent can expect when taking different actions. More specifically, the objective of the agent is to learn a policy function π(lt|z1:t;W ) with parameters W that, at each step t, maps the history of past interactions with the environment z1:t =\nx1, l1, ...lt−1, xt (a sequence of past observations and actions taken by the agent) to a distribution over actions for the current time step. Here, the policy π is defined by our neural network architecture, and the history of interactions z1:t is summarized in the internal memory state ht. For simplicity, we will use Zt = z1:t to indicate all histories up to time t, thus, the policy function can be written as π(lt|Zt;W ).\nTo put it in a formal way, the policy of deep RL agent π(lt|Zt;W ) induces a distribution over possible interactions Zt and we aim to maximize the total reward R under this distribution, thus, the objective is defined as:\nG(W ) = Ep(z1:T ;W )[ T∑ t=1 rt] = Ep(ZT ;W )[R] (5)\nwhere p(z1:T ;W ) is the distribution over possible interactions parameterized by W .\nThis formulation involves an expectation over highdimensional interactions which is hard to solve in traditional supervised manner. Here, we bring techniques from the RL community to solve this problem, as shown in [42], the gradient can be first simplified by taking the derivative over log-probability of the policy function π:\n∇WG = T∑ t=1 Ep(ZT ;W )[∇W lnπ(lt|Zt;W )R] (6)\nand the expectation can be further approximated by an episodic algorithm: since the action is drawn from probabilistic distributions, one can execute the same policy for many episodes and approximate expectation by taking the average, thus\n∇WG ≈ 1\nN N∑ i=1 T∑ t=1 ∇W lnπ(lit|Zit ;W )Ri (7)\nwhere Ris are cumulative rewards obtained by running the current policy π for N episodes, i = 1...N .\nThe above training rule is known as the episodic REINFORCE [42] algorithm, and it involves running the deep RL agent with its current policy to obtain samples of interactions and then updating parameters W of the agent such that the log-probability of chosen actions that have led to high overall rewards is increased.\nIn practice, although Equation 7 computes a good estimation of the gradient ∇WG, when applied to train the deep RL agent, the training process is hard to converge due to the high variance of this gradient estimation. Thus, in order to obtain an unbiased low-variance gradient estimation, a common method is to subtract a reinforcement baseline from the cumulative rewards R:\n∇WG ≈ 1\nN N∑ i=1 T∑ t=1 ∇W lnπ(lit|Zit ;W )(Rit − bt) (8)\nwhere bt is called reinforcement baseline in the RL literature, it is natural to select bt = Eπ[Rt], and this form of baseline is known as the value function [37]. This estimation maintains the same expectation with Equation 7 while sufficiently reduces the variance."

The CNN structure had two convolutional layers with filter sizes of 8× 5× 5 and 16× 5× 5, each followed by a 2× 2 maxpooling layer and the ReLU activation function.\nMemory component: An LSTM was used here as the memory component.

In this experiment, we generated videos, each with a single 28 × 28 MNIST digit\nmoving in a random walk manner with momentum. The dataset consisted of 500 training sequences and 100 test sequences. Each testing video sequence contained 100 frames while each training sequence only contained 20 frames. The training algorithm was the same as Algorithm 1, we used T = 10 and N = 5 as these hyper-parameters provided the best tracking performance. The initial learning rate was 0.00001 and we annealed the learning rate linearly from its initial value to 0 over the course of training. We trained the model up to 2000 epochs, or until the cumulative tracking reward R stopped increasing. The trained model was directly applied to the test sequences with no online finetuning. Since the scale of MNIST digits didn’t change in this experiment, the output of deep RL agent had two neurons directly encoding the center location (x, y) of target object. The qualitative result is shown in Figure 4a, and the second row of Table 1 shows the evaluation result.\nScalable moving MNIST against a black background: The second problem we considered was tracking a scalable MNIST digit moving in a black background, and we wanted to see whether our model was capable of predicting scale changes. In this experiment, we generated new sequences for training and testing. We used the same script as in the previous experiment to generate this dataset except that the 28 × 28 MNIST digits were replaced by scalable MNIST digits: the side length of a MNIST digit was defined as st = kst−1 where k was a random number uniformly sampled from (−0.5, 2), and we limited the side length s in range (14, 56) to make sure that the digit did not become either too large or too small. The network architectures were slightly changed such that there were 3 output neurons which encoded not only the center location (x, y) but also the side length w, and we didn’t modify the CNN and RNN architecture. The network was randomly initialized and trained from scratch following the same training and testing procedures as discussed in the previous experiment. Figure 4b shows the tracking result, and the third row of Table 1 presents the quantitative evaluation metrics.\nScalable moving MNIST against a noisy background: One of the most challenging aspects of object tracking is the presence of cluttered and noisy background. It is interesting to investigate how robust our tracker is in this scenario. In this experiment, we leveraged the same dataset in the second experiment, but added random background noise for each training and testing video. Technically, we added white noise dots by randomly selecting 500 points in the 100 × 100 canvas, and we also added one MNIST digit as distraction in the background. We used the same network design as in the second experiment and followed the same training procedure to train our network from scratch. Our testing results showed that our tracker was robust enough to not only predict center locations but also kept track of scale changes.

We have found in our experiments that the proposed framework possesses:\n• Generalizability: In all experiments, we evaluate a trained model on test sequences that are longer than the training sequences, and our model has proven to be able to generalize to longer test sequences. This is not only because of we apply RNN in our design, but also due to the RL algorithm that allows us to take longterm rewards into consideration.\n• Adaptability: By formulating tracking as a decision making process, the number of neurons in the output layer entirely depends on tracking complexity. We have shown that our model can achieve reasonable performance by changing only the last-layer architecture and keeping other components untouched. This is a desirable feature for machine learning models since a general model can be applied to different tasks with minimal alteration.\n• Robustness: The features are captured by the CNN and RNN in our tracking model, and our experiments have shown that by leveraging the same CNN and RNN architectures, our model is not only able to generate more complex predictions but is also robust to background noise. This shows that our network design is robust and informative in terms of learning good tracking features.\nWe will extend our framework for real-world tracking datasets in our future work."

    "abstractText" : "Convolutional neural network (CNN) models have achieved tremendous success in many visual detection and recognition tasks. Unfortunately, visual tracking, a fundamental computer vision problem, is not handled well using the existing CNN models, because most object trackers implemented with CNN do not effectively leverage temporal and contextual information among consecutive frames. Recurrent neural network (RNN) models, on the other hand, are often used to process text and voice data due to their ability to learn intrinsic representations of sequential and temporal data. Here, we propose a novel neural network tracking model that is capable of integrating information over time and tracking a selected target in video. It comprises three components: a CNN extracting best tracking features in each video frame, an RNN constructing video memory state, and a reinforcement learning (RL) agent making target location decisions. The tracking problem is formulated as a decision-making process, and our model can be trained with RL algorithms to learn good tracking policies that pay attention to continuous, inter-frame correlation and maximize tracking performance in the long run. We compare our model with an existing neural-network based tracking method and show that the proposed tracking approach works well in various scenarios by performing rigorous validation experiments on artificial video sequences with ground truth. To the best of our knowledge, our tracker is the first neural-network tracker that combines convolutional and recurrent networks with RL algorithms.",
