      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "In essence, TimeML mandates the mark up of expressions referring to times, expressions denoting events and expressions signalling temporal relations between times and events or events and events; it also allows links to be added between entities, which are labelled with the temporal relation holding between them. Existing TimeML tools can be divided into two categories: those which produce or alter mark-up, for example to assist annotation, and those that perform analysis. Only a few tools have as yet been developed for TimeML, mostly focusing on the annotation task, such as TTK (Verhagen and Pustejovsky, 2008), which does not support analysis. From the second category, in the absence of other software, the TimeML-using community is restricted to generic XML analysis tools, such as Xaira (Burnard and Dodd, 2003) or LT-XML1, as well as similar format-specific tools (TEI). These generic corpus tools are powerful applications, but require substantial effort to apply to TimeML data. We have constructed CAVaT (Corpus Analysis and Validation for TimeML) to process collections of temporally annotated documents. CAVaT’s functionality is divided into two main parts; an integrated browsing and report generation system, and a modular extensible error checking and corpus validation framework. In this paper, we first describe the technical aspects of the tool. We then present the reporting part of CAVaT, and then its error-checking ability, followed by the execution of some example tasks using the tool. We present an overview of the tool’s operation and capabilities in Section 2. This includes details of the corpus loading and folding process (Section 2.1), report generation, and also a detailed explanation of the advanced validation modules that are included with CAVaT (Section 2.3). A brief syntax summary is presented in Section 3; the full guide is on the CAVaT website2. Next, in Section 4, we present sample queries and output. In Section 5, we show inconsistencies and observations in a TimeML corpus (TimeBank) that have been de-\n1From http://www.ltg.ed.ac.uk/software/ltxml 2Available at http://code.google.com/p/cavat/\ntected with CAVaT.

      "heading" : "2. Overview of the tool",
      "text" : "CAVaT is an open source tool, constructed from a set of Python modules and a database. It uses NLTK3 and MySQL4. The interface is a text-based interactive prompt, and all operations are performed with text commands. Command syntax strives to be simple, flexible and close to natural language. After loading and pre-processing a TimeML corpus, one can analyse it using built-in reporting functions, and perform data validation with one of many checking components."

      "heading" : "2.1. Preprocessing",
      "text" : "CAVaT can work on any TimeML-annotated corpus that is stored as a collection of uncompressed files in a single directory, by importing it to a set of database tables. The corpus is initially processed by an XML parser (using Python’s minidom and expat implementations), which retrieves document level data as well as all temporally annotated information, and places it into a MySQL database. Temporally annotated data includes all TimeML tags and their attributes, as well any enclosed tokens for EVENT, SIGNAL and TIMEX3 tags. In TimeML, events are represented with the EVENT tag, and temporal expressions with the TIMEX3 tag. These intervals are the elements which CAVaT and the rest of this paper assume as temporal primitives, unless otherwise stated. Temporal relations between intervals are described with the TLINK tag, and temporal signals with SIGNAL. See Figure 1 for an example. Automatically classifying the type of temporal relation between intervals is currently a difficult problem in temporal processing of text (Mani et al., 2006; Lapata and Lascarides, 2006; Hepple et al., 2007). The task is often made simpler by reducing the number of temporal link classes. TimeML includes BEFORE and AFTER relations, though\n3See http://www.nltk.org/ 4See http://www.mysql.com/\none may simply reverse the arguments of a BEFORE relation to turn it into an AFTER one — so, June 2008 was before August 2009 is equivalent to August 2009 was after June 2008. It is thus possible to convert all links of one of these types to the other. We call this technique folding. Given a set of mappings, the 13 TimeML relations can be reduced. CAVaT offers three folds:\n• CAVaT fold – Collapses all inverse relations, such as mapping INCLUDED BY to INCLUDES (see Table 1).\n• SputLink fold – The mapping introduced by Marc Verhagen, included in TTK (Verhagen, 2005).\n• Compact fold – Reduces TimeML’s link relation set to 3 classes, using mappings defined in Setzer et al. (2005).\nThe first two are lossless, in that no temporal information is removed by the folding process. The third is lossy. It is possible to perform a lossy fold by, for example, reducing the TimeML BEGUN BY relationship to one of INCLUDES."

      "heading" : "2.2. Querying",
      "text" : "The reporting part of CAVaT makes analysis of TimeML corpora simpler and easier than working directly with a set of XML documents, allowing flexible queries, and catering for inquiries specific to temporally-annotated data. The development of CAVaT has been driven by investigations of TimeML corpora. Many of the operations performed against a corpora had common elements, often centred around the retrieval of class distributions or token frequencies. A tool for TimeML corpus research could encompass all the required operations, while providing access to a larger range of reports.\nCAVaT uses a report generation system where one can view any number of pre-defined features that match conditions of the user’s choosing. Queries can produce reports at varying levels of granularity – one may choose to examine data at sentence, document or corpus level. Reports can output counts, distributions, lists or text extracts. Example queries are listed in Section 4. Data such as part-of-speech information, tense, aspect, and event recurrence are captured by attributes described by TimeML, and any data like this (annotated by tags and their attributes) can be queried. In addition, properties specific to temporal data but not directly present in mark-up are implemented, including:\n• Event / event instance abstraction In some cases, one piece of text may refer to two separate events (an example is given later in Section 5.1.). To permit annotation of this, TimeML’s EVENT tag is placed around the text, and then event instances are specified using one or more MAKEINSTANCE tags. Data relating to a piece of event text, such as part of speech, polarity and modality, are described in the MAKEINSTANCE tag. However, we would often like to see the part of speech data for an event; indeed, when discussing temporal entities, the term “event” is often used in place of “event instance”. Thus, CAVaT implicitly translates between these two related tags when requested; for example, when one asks to see event modality or cardinality.\n• Signalled links TLINKs may indicate a textual signal that suggests the type of relationship between their arguments. For example, in Lydia ate dinner before leaving the house, the word before acts as a signal, ordering two events. As signals are explicit indicators of temporal association, and correctly typing a temporal link is difficult, it is useful to be able to quickly identify which links employ a signal.\n• Signal text and TLINKs As SIGNAL text referenced from a TLINK may be thought of as that TLINK’s signal text, CAVaT permits queries that specify signal text as an attribute of a TLINK.\n• Text position and lemma Although not part of the TimeML annotation schema, CAVaT logs text position (by sentence number and word number), and maintains lemmas of text found within tags.\nOne may view a particular TLINK’s location in the original document, showing the link’s arguments and their relation type. This helps understand the context of a single TLINK. For example, one may often see many links to a single document date, or discover that most links have arguments within the same paragraph – something not immediately obvious to humans while browsing the TLINK markup, and unclear with generic corpus tools."

      "heading" : "2.3. Checking",
      "text" : "Temporal annotation is a complex task, and as a result, a relatively small amount of text has been annotated to date. The largest TimeML corpus is TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003), with less than 200 documents, and around 65000\ntokens. Because of the complexity of temporal annotation, errors can arise beyond those that may be detected using an XML DTD. CAVaT is both a reporting and validation tool, and seeks to automatically detect high-level and complex errors that are rarely immediately obvious. Part of the motivation behind this part of the tool is similar to that of writing unit tests that highlight bugs in an application: to improve quality by automatically detecting previously seen errors. In this section we detail some checks that CAVaT can perform on a TimeML corpus. Error checks are defined as Python modules, so that one may describe a detection method for an error case and share it with other researchers without modifying CAVaT’s core code. The modules inherit from the cavatModule class; documentation is in the source code, and one may view a list of available modules with the commandcheck list."

      "heading" : "2.3.1. Inconsistent closure",
      "text" : "It is possible to create an inconsistent configuration of temporal links. For example, we may have A BEFORE B and B INCLUDES A; this is clearly not possible, as INCLUDES stipulates that the start point of A occur after the start point of B (see Figure 2). While this example is fairly clear, it may not be at all clear to human annotators that a partial temporal link annotation could imply an inconsistent configuration. Automatically checking the consistency of a temporal network is hard. TimeML’s relations are based on those of Allen (1983), and it is difficult to guarantee the consistency of networks formed using the latter set of relations (Vilain et al., 1989; Tsang, 1987). We re-state the problem in a more simple fashion, as follows. Intervals are represented by pairs of endpoints, and we define intervals and the TimeML relations between them in terms of relations between these points. Our model uses only simultaneous (=) and before (<) relations. The consistency checker works in a similar way to the closure algorithm in Setzer et al. (2005). It maintains an agenda and database. Assertions are taken from the agenda and used to infer further assertions when combined with assertions in the database. We initially process intervals in the document (taken from TLINK arguments) – for each interval I we add Istart < Iend to the database. We then generate initial data for the agenda based on TLINKs in the document and a mapping for each TLINK to one or more assertions, listed in Table 2. The only inference rules needed with our minimal set of relations are:\n• If x = y then y = x • If x = y and y = z then x = z • If x < y and y < z then x < z\nWe can take items from the agenda. For each such item, we compare it against the database, and deduce new relations using the above rules. If a newly generated relation conflicts with anything in the agenda or database, then the document is inconsistent. Otherwise, we will move the item from the agenda to the database, and add newly generated relations to the agenda. If we can clear the agenda, then the document is consistent; otherwise, it is not. Whether we add new relations to the top or bottom of the agenda (achieving depth- or breadth-first search, respectively) is irrelevant to the success of the algorithm, though computational performance differences have not been measured. Our baselines are the results of the tlink loop test (Section 2.3.3.) and also the results of closure success according to SputLink (Verhagen, 2005). This algorithm detected all known inconsistencies in TimeBank, and found one more; full details are later in Section 5.2. A test TimeML corpus is included with CAVaT for verifying that the consistency checker works, which alternative implementations may use for validation. Below is sample output from a consistency check:\ncavat> check consistent in 3 # Temporal graph consistency checker v1 loaded # Checking wsj_0927.tml (id 3) ! Inconsistent closure - could not assert (ei2415_2 < ei2414_1)"

      "heading" : "2.3.2. Disconnected sub-graph detection",
      "text" : "After inferring a temporal closure (Verhagen, 2005) of a document, one is usually left with a single interconnected temporal graph, where nodes are TIMEX3s or EVENTs and edges represent TLINKs. However, disconnected groups of links may exist post-closure. This should be brought to the attention of the user; it often suggests that annotating a small number of additional links can greatly increase the amount of data inferable though closure, and that an annotation is incomplete. CAVaT’s sub-graph identification module, split graph, works by processing TLINKs from a document sequentially. We maintain a list of sets that will hold intercon-\nnected intervals, beginning with an empty list. For each TLINK, we check to see if either of its arguments (which are both intervals) can be found in any set in our list. If one argument can but the other cannot, the new interval is added to the same set as the found interval. If they are both found in the same set, no action is taken. If they are found in different sets, those two sets are merged. If neither TLINK argument can be found anywhere, a new set holding both intervals is created. This process is repeated until all TLINKs have been processed, at which point each set in the list represents an independent sub-graph of connected intervals. The module will then report statistics about the graph(s) found in the specified document. These include:\n• Count of sub-graphs, intervals and TLINKs; • The number of “isolated” sub-graphs – that is, those\ndescribed by only one temporal link – and the proportion of intervals/links used to describe all these isolated sub-graphs; • Mean and maximum sub-graph size, and the proportion of the document’s intervals that are in the largest sub-graph; • The entropy of sub-graph sizes, which acts as a “fracturedness” measure, showing how far the document is from having one single totally connected temporal graph including all TLINKs; • The distribution of sub-graph sizes.\nEven though sub-graphs are populated by processing the two intervals of a TLINK at the same time, it is possible to have a sub-graph containing just one node, in the case of a TLINK loop (Section 2.3.3.). Note that a document containing intervals but no temporal links between them is marked as “un-fractured”, as this check ignores any items not referenced at least once by a temporal link. Here is sample output from an attempt to identify disconnected sub-graphs:\ncavat> check split_graph in 3 # Split graph detection v1 loaded # Checking wsj_0927.tml (id 3) Subgraphs found: 13 - composed of 69 nodes and linked by 65 TLINKS.

Entropy of subgraph sizes: 0.448277644573 2 nodes: ( 5) ..... 3 nodes: ( 4) .... 4 nodes: ( 3) ...\n35 nodes: ( 1) ."

      "heading" : "2.3.4. Orphaned object details",
      "text" : "There is not yet a definition for TimeML annotation completeness, that states a minimal satisfactory level of annotation for a document. In the absence of such a definition, it is not a mistake to annotate entities without attaching them to anything else in the document. However, we believe that wherever possible, every interval should be connected to at least one other interval, and that the annotation of entities that do not contribute or relate to any other annotated information is superfluous. For example, if one chooses to mark text as a temporal signal, a related link or event instance should reference the signal. In this example, if the signal conveys no temporal information, it should not be annotated. To this end, CAVaT includes a module that is aware of five cases which describe objects attached to nothing else, and reports such orphan objects. Firstly, any TIMEX3 that is not related by any link is deemed to be independent. Also, any event instance (from MAKEINSTANCE) that is not referenced by a link is also orphaned. Next, an EVENT that is never instantiated is unattached, as instantiation is required by current TimeML syntax before EVENTs can be linked to anything else. Instances that come from nonexistent or mislabelled EVENTs are also orphans. Finally, SIGNALs that are not referenced by any link or event instance (as in our example above) are included in the list of orphaned objects. Here is the sample output from a check for orphans:\ncavat> check orphans in wsj_0927.tml # Orphaned tag detection v1 loaded TIMEX3 t104 not in any link TIMEX3 t131 not in any link"

One can view all values for a tag with “list” reports, or the distribution of values with “distribution” reports, or simply see how many instances of that tag use a particular field with “state” reports. The general format for report generation is: show <report type> of <tag> <field> [as <format>] From the above example, <tag> corresponds to a TimeML tag, and is one of event, instance, timex3, signal, tlink, slink or alink. As well as the attributes available for each tag, the following extra values for <field> are available:\n• For TLINKs, signaltext refers to the text enclosed by the start and end tags of an associated signal; • For EVENTs, one may reference all the attributes of a MAKEINSTANCE tag too; • In TLINKs, SLINKs and ALINKs the arguments are referred to as arg1 and arg2, so that the CAVaT user does not have to worry about the implicit indication of interval type present in attribute names.\nReports are available in multiple formats. These can be specified by adding as <format> to the end of a show query.\n• screen - The default choice, screen gives text formatted for display in a fixed-width font. • csv - Output as comma separated values. • tex - TeX table format, including caption.\nThe TeX output of an example report, showing the distribution of TLINK relTypes in TimeBank v1.2, can be generated with show distribution of tlink reltype as tex and is shown in Table 3. One may also specify a subset of a corpus to be used for reporting, using a simple where clause. For example, one may ask: cavat> show state of tlink signalid where reltype is\nafter to see how many TLINKs of type AFTER use a signal; or, one may ask: cavat> show distribution of tlink reltype where signalid\nis not filled to find out which relTypes are most likely in TLINKs that do not specify a signal.

The modular error checks allow creation of an open database of TimeML validations, to help improve the integrity of all TimeML corpora. Check modules that match the output of rule-based high confidence tools such as S2T (Verhagen and Pustejovsky, 2008) can be added. The consistency checker is “a TimeML closure engine that uses the precise relations behind the scenes” (Verhagen, 2005). Therefore, it may be used to empirically discover how often incorrect links are introduced in closure, when compared with the existing leading closure tool, SputLink.\n5LDC catalogue number LDC2006T08 6http://www.timeml.org/tempeval2/\nAcknowledgements The first author would like to acknowledge the UK Engineering and Physical Science Research Council for support in the form of a doctoral studentship, and Marc Verhagen of Brandeis University for useful comments on the temporal closure process."

It provides reporting, highlights salient links between a variety of general and time-specific linguistic features, and also validates a temporal annotation to ensure that it is logically consistent and sufficiently annotated. Uniquely, CAVaT provides analysis specific to TimeML-annotated temporal information. TimeML is a standard for annotating temporal information in natural language text. In this paper, we present the reporting part of CAVaT, and then its error-checking ability, including the workings of several novel TimeML document verification methods. This is followed by the execution of some example tasks using the tool to show relations between times, events, signals and links. We also demonstrate inconsistencies in a TimeML corpus (TimeBank) that have been detected with CAVaT.",
