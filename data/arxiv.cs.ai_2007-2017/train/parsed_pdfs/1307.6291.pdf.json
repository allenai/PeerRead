      "text" : "Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), in the Computer\nScience area, is a problem of determining whether there exists a Boolean value assignment, which satisfies the given formula. In other words, given a Boolean expression written using only AND (∧), OR (∨), NOT (¬), variables, and parentheses, is there some assignment of TRUE and FALSE values to the variables that make the entire expression evaluate to TRUE. On the other hand, the formula is unsatisfiable if no such assignment exists, which indicate that the entire expression is evaluated to FALSE for all possible variables assignments. For example, the Boolean expression A ∧ B, setting the both variables A and B to be TRUE to make the whole sentence TRUE, i.e., the expression A ∧ B is satisfiable. However, there exists unsatisfiable expression, such as A ∧ ¬A, no matter variable A is TRUE or FALSE, the expression A ∧ ¬A is always FALSE. The SAT problem can be applied in many fields of Computer Science and Engineering, including underlying model for a significant and increasing number of applications in Electronics Design Automation (EDA). Furthermore, a large number of problems that occur in knowledge base, learning, planning and other areas of areas of artificial intelligence (AI) are essentially the problems of SAT."

For instance, the formula A ∧ (B ∨ C) is in CNF. Furthermore, every propositional formula can be converted into an equivalent formula that is in CNF by using rules of logical equivalences. In addition, there are other forms such as Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) and Horn Form. However, we will mainly focus on CNF here."

Consider a real life problem, suppose you have a wedding to plan, and want to arrange the wedding seating for a certain number of guests in a hall. The hall has a certain number tables for seating. Some pairs of guests are couples or close Friends, and want to sit together at the same table. Some other pairs of guests are Enemies, and must be separated into different tables. The rest pairs are Indifferent with each other, and do not mind sitting together or not. However, each pair of guests can only have one relationship, Friends, Enemies or Indifferent.

The number of pairs of Friends is F, and the number of pairs of Enemies is E; Let X(i,n) denotes that guest i sit at table n, and we can get the corresponding formulas, and guest i and f are friends, i and e are enemies:\n(a) X(i, 1) ∨ X(i, 2) ∨ … X(i, n) ∨ … X(i, N)\n(1 ≤ i ≤ M, 1 ≤ n ≤ N)\n(b) ¬X(i, k) ∨ ¬X(i, n)\n(1 ≤ i ≤ M, 1 ≤ k ≠ n ≤ N)\n(c) {¬X(i, n) ∨ X(f, n)} ∧ {¬X(f, n) ∨ X(i, n)}\n(1 ≤ i, f ≤ M, 1 ≤ n ≤ N)\n(d) ¬X(i, n) ∨ ¬X(j, n)\n(1 ≤ i, j ≤ M, 1 ≤ n ≤ N)\nThen the whole sentence which contain all the\nconstraint should be the conjunction of all the above clauses:\n{X(i, 1) ∨ X(i, 2) ∨ … X(i, n) ∨ … X(i, N)} ∧\n{¬X(i, k) ∨ ¬X(i, n)} ∧ {¬X(i, n) ∨ X(f, n)} ∧\n{¬X(f, n) ∨ X(i, n)} ∧ {¬X(i, n) ∨ ¬X(j, n)}\n(1 ≤ i ≤ M, 1 ≤ k ≠ n ≤ N)\nIf we can find a Boolean value assignment for each term X(i, n) in the above sentence and make the sentence evaluate TRUE, then we solve our wedding seating arrangement problem."

NPC is a class of decision problem, i.e., if we already have a solution on hand, then we can check whether the solution is correct in polynomial time, just by substituting all the variables with the Boolean assignment and check whether the sentence is TRUE; however, finding such a Boolean assignment is in exponential time. Consider just using brute force to solve the above wedding seating arrangement problem, we try assigning all the possible values for the sentence, then the space would be O(2 MN ), which grows exponentially with the increase of M and N. However, if we are using AI technology to find the solution more intelligently, we can find the solution more quickly but the solution is suboptimal, which we will discuss in detail later.\n3.

The main idea of this algorithm is achieve new clauses by resolving each pair of clauses in the Knowledge Base (KB), For example, clause A ∨ B and clause ¬A ∨ C can be resolved to a new clause B ∨ C. Then, add the new clauses into KB. Only two results would occur in the end: (1) the resolve step gives us an empty clause, indicating there is a contradiction in KB, which means KB is unsatisfiable. For instance, clause A and ¬A would be resolved to empty clause, besides, we know A ∧ ¬A is always FALSE intuitively; (2) otherwise the new clauses we gain are already in the KB, which mean there is no contradiction, and KB is satisfiable. The pseudo code of this algorithm [1] can be written as follow:\nfunction PLRESOLUTION(KB) returns true or false\ninputs: KB, the knowledge base, a sentence in\npropositional logic\nclauses <– the set of clauses in the CNF\nrepresentation of KB\nnew <– {} loop do\nfor each pair of clauses Ci, Cj in clauses do\nresolvents <– PL-RESOLVE(Ci, Cj) if resolvents contains the empty\nclause then return false\nnew <– new ∪ resolvents if new ∈ clauses then return true clauses <– clauses ∪ new"

      "text" : "Unlike PL-Resolution, the WalkSAT Algorithm can\ndetermine satisfiability (if it finds a model), but it cannot absolutely determine unsatisfiability. WalkSAT is one of the simplest and most effective algorithms. At first, WalkSAT randomly generate a model and assign all the variables with that model. If the sentence is unsatisfiable under this model, it will modify the model. It chooses a unsatisfied clause randomly and selects a variable in taht clause to flip in every iteration. There are two way of deciding which variable should be flipped: (1) “minconflicts” step, which minimize the number of unsatisfied clauses in the new state; (2) “random walk” step, which just picks the variable randomly. The pseudo code of this algorithm[1] can be written as follow:\nfunction WALKSAT(clauses, p, max_flips) return\na satisfying model or failure\ninputs: clauses, a set of clauses in propositional\nlogic\np, the probability of choosing to do a\n\"random walk\" move, typically around 0.5\nmax_flips, number of flips allowed before\ngiving up\nmodel <– a random assignment of true/false to\nthe symbols in clauses\nfor i = 1 to max_flips do\nif model satisfies clauses then return model clause <– a randomly selected clause from\nclauses that is false in model\nwith probability p flip the value in model\nof a randomly selected symbol from clause\nelse flip whichever symbol in clause\nmaximizes the number of satisfied clauses return failure\nWhen WalkSAT returns a model, the input sentence\nis indeed satisfiable, and we also find the solution which is its return model, but when it returns failure, there are two possible causes: either the sentence is unsatisfiable or the number of iteration reaches the max_flips. The mechanism of this algorithm cannot guarantee to decide whether the input sentence is satisfiable or not. However, this algorithm is much faster compared to PL-Resolution and can gain good performance if we set p and max_flips properly."

      "heading" : "4. Experiment",
      "text" : "We will compare these two algorithms in terms of\nperformance and use the example of seating arrangement problem that we mentioned before. In order to simulate this problem, we first generate randomly relationship for each pairs of guests, setting any two guests are Friends with probability f, or are Enemies with probability e. And any two guests are Indifferent to each other with probability 1-f-e. Besides, we also set the number of guests to be M and the number of tables to be N. Then we convert our generated instance of wedding seating arrangement into a CNF sentence.\nThe difficulty of wedding seat arrangement problem mostly results from dealing with the pairs of Enemies among guests. We use both algorithms to produce a plot of P, which is the possibility of the instance is satisfiability, as a function of the probability e with which any two guests are Enemies. Suppose we have a small wedding to plan, and set M=16 and N=2. In order to eliminate the influence of Friends relationship, we set f=0. Generate a set of 100 random sentences for each setting of e, which increases from 2% to 20% at an interval of 2%, and use both algorithms to determine whether they are satisfiable. For WalkSAT, we set p=50% and max_flips=100. We plot the results of P versus e for both algorithms on the same graph as follow:\nAccording to Figure, we can see that the P of PLResolution is always higher than or equal to that of WalkSAT, which support the different ideal of PLResolution and WalkSAT. Though the performance of PL-Resolution is always better than WalkSAT, the runtime of PL-Resolution is growing exponentially. At the beginning, the WalkSAT performance as well as PLResolution did as we expected, because the problem is easy at first. As the e increasing, the problem become much more hard because the condition is more restrict. When e reach 20%, both algorithm can hardly find solution."

PL-Resolution is a sound and complete algorithm that can be used to determine satisfiability and unsatisfiability with certainty. WalkSAT can determine satisfiability if it find a model, but it cannot guarantee to find a model even there exists one. However, WalkSAT is much faster than PLResolution, which makes WalkSAT more practical; and we have analysis the performance between these two algorithms, and the performance of WalkSAT is acceptable if the problem is not so hard. In conclusion, if we just want to solve the problem and need it be done very quickly, WalkSAT is the best choice; we also can adjust the argument max_flips to high to get more chance of finding the solution. On the other hand, if you have plenty of time, you can chose PL-Resolution which will guarantee give you the answer of whether the sentence is satisfy."
