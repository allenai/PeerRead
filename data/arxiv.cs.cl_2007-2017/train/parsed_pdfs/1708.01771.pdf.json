      "text" : "The encoder-decoder based neural machine translation (NMT) models (Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014) have been developing rapidly. Sutskever et al. (2014) propose to encode the source sentence as a fixed-length vector representation, based on which the decoder generates the target sequence, where both the encoder and decoder are recurrent neural networks (RNN) (Sutskever et al., 2014) or their variants (Cho et al., 2014; Chung et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014). In this framework, the fixedlength vector plays the crucial role of transitioning\nthe information of the sentence from the source side to the target side.\nLater, attention mechanisms are proposed to enhance the source side representations (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015b). The source side context is computed at each time-step of decoding, based on the attention weights between the source side representations and the current hidden state of the decoder. However, the hidden states in the recurrent decoder still originate from the single fixed-length representation (Luong et al., 2015b), or the average of the bi-directional representations (Bahdanau et al., 2014). Here we refer to the representation as initial state.\nInterestingly, Britz et al. (2017) find that the value of initial state does not affect the translation performance, and prefer to set the initial state to be a zero vector. On the contrary, we argue that initial state still plays an important role of translation, which is currently neglected. We notice that beside the end-to-end error back propagation for the initial and transition parameters, there is no direct control of the initial state in the current NMT architectures. Due to the large number of parameters, it may be difficult for the NMT system to learn the proper sentence representation as the initial state. Thus, the model is very likely to get stuck in local minimums, making the translation process arbitrary and unstable.\nIn this paper, we propose to augment the current NMT architecture with a word prediction mechanism. More specifically, we require the initial state of the decoder to be able to predict all the words in the target sentence. In this way, there is a specific objective for learning the initial state. Thus the learnt source side representation will be better constrained. We further extend this idea by applying the word predictions mechanism to all the hidden states of the decoder. So the transition between different decoder states could be controlled\nar X\niv :1\n70 8.\n01 77\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 5\nA ug\n2 01\n7\nas well. Our mechanism is simple and requires no additional data or annotation. The proposed word predictions mechanism could be used as a training method and brings no extra computing cost during decoding.\nExperiments on the Chinese-English and German-English translation tasks show that both the constraining of the initial state and the decoder hidden states bring significant improvement over the baseline systems. Furthermore, using the word prediction mechanism on the initial state as a word predictor to reduce the target side vocabulary could greatly improve the decoding efficiency, without a significant loss on the translation quality."

      "text" : "Many previous works have noticed the problem of training an NMT system with lots of parameters. Some of them prefer to use the dropout technique (Srivastava et al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015b; Meng et al., 2016). Another possible choice is to ensemble several models with random starting points (Sutskever et al., 2014; Jean et al., 2015; Luong and Manning, 2016). Both techniques could bring more stable and better results. But they are general training techniques of neural networks, which are not specifically targeting the modeling of the translation process like ours. We will make empirical comparison with them in the experiments.\nThe way we add the word prediction is similar to the research of multi-task learning. Dong et al. (2015) propose to share an encoder between different translation tasks. Luong et al. (2015a) propose to jointly learn the translation task for different languages, the parsing task and the image captioning task, with a shared encoder or decoder. Zhang and Zong (2016) propose to use multitask learning for incorporating source side monolingual data. Different from these attempts, our method focuses solely on the current translation task, and does not require any extra data or annotation.\nIn the other sequence to sequence tasks, Suzuki and Nagata (2017) propose the idea for predicting words by using encoder information. However, the purpose and the way of our mechanism are different from them.\nThe word prediction technique has been applied in the research of both statistical machine transla-\ntion (SMT) (Bangalore et al., 2007; Mauser et al., 2009; Jeong et al., 2010; Tran et al., 2014) and NMT (Mi et al., 2016; L’Hostis et al., 2016). In these research, word prediction mechanisms are employed to decide the selection of words or constrain the target vocabulary, while in this paper, we use word prediction as a control mechanism for neural model training."

For each xi, the representation hi is:\nhi = [ −→ hi ; ←− hi ] (1)\nwhere [·; ·] denotes the concatenation of column vectors; −→ hi and ←− hi denote the hidden vectors for the word xi in the forward and backward RNNs, respectively.\nThe gated recurrent unit (GRU) is used as the recurrent unit in each RNN, which is shown to have promising results in speech recognition and machine translation (Cho et al., 2014). Formally, the hidden state hi at time step i of the forward RNN encoder is defined by the GRU function g−→e (·, ·), as follows:\n−→ h i = g−→e ( −→ h i−1, embxi) (2)\n= (1−−→z i) −→ h i−1 +−→z i −→ h′ i\n−→z i = σ( −→ Wz[embxi ; −→ h i−1]) (3) −→ h′ i = tanh( −→ W[embxi ; ( −→r i −→ h i−1)]) (4) −→r i = σ( −→ Wr[embxi ; −→ h i−1]) (5)\nwhere denotes element-wise product between vectors and embxi is the word embedding of the xi. tanh(·) and σ(·) are the tanh and sigmoid transformation functions that can be applied elementwise on vectors, respectively. For simplicity, we\nomit the bias term in each network layer. The backward RNN encoder is defined likewise.\nIn the decoding stage, the decoder starts with the initial state s0, which is the average of source representations (Bahdanau et al., 2014).\ns0 = σ(Ws 1\n|x| |x|∑ i=1 hi) (6)\nAt each time step j, the decoder maximizes the conditional probability of generating the jth target word, which is defined as:\nP (yj |y<j , x) = fd(td([embyj−1 ; sj ; cj ])) (7) fd(u) = softmax(Wfu) (8) td(v) = tanh(Wtv) (9)\nwhere sj is the decoder’s hidden state, which is computed by another GRU (as in Equation 2):\nsj = gd(sj−1, [embyj−1 ; cj ]) (10)\nand the context vector cj is from the attention mechanism (Luong et al., 2015b):\ncj = |x|∑ i=1 ajihi (11)\naji = exp(eji)∑|x|\nk=1 exp(ejk) (12)\neji = tanh(Wattd [sj−1;hi]).

      "text" : "The decoder starts the generation of target sentence from the initial state s0 (Equation 6) generated by the encoder. Currently, the update for\nthe encoder only happens when a translation error occurs in the decoder. The error is propagated through multiple time steps in the recurrent structure until it reaches the encoder. As there are hundreds of millions of parameters in the NMT system, it is hard for the model to learn the exact representation of source sentences. As a result, the values of initial state may not be exact during the translation process, leading to poor translation performances.\nWe propose word prediction as a mechanism to control the values of initial state. The intuition is that since the initial state is responsible for the translation of whole target sentence, it should at least contain information of each word in the target sentence. Thus, we optimize the initial state by making prediction for all target words. For simplicity, we assume each target word is independent of each other.\nHere the word prediction mechanism is a simpler sub-task of translation, where the order of words is not considered. The prediction task could be trained jointly with the translation task in a multi-task learning way (Luong et al., 2015a; Dong et al., 2015; Zhang and Zong, 2016), where both tasks share the same encoder. In other words, word prediction for the initial state could be interpreted as an improvement for the encoder. We denote this mechanism as WPE .\nAs shown in Figure 1, a prediction network is added to the initial state. We define the conditional probability of WPE as follows:\nPWPE(y|x) = |y|∏ j=1 PWPE(yj |x) (14)\nPWPE(yj |x) = fp(tp([s0; cp])) (15)\nwhere fp(·) and tp(·) are the softmax layer and non-linear layer as defined in Equation 8-9, with\ndifferent parameters; cp is defined similar as the attention network, so the source side information could be enhanced.\ncp = |x|∑ i=1 aihi (16) ai = exp(ei)∑|x|\nk=1 exp(ek) (17)\nei = tanh(Wattp [s0,hi]).

      "text" : "Similar intuition is also applied for the decoder. Because the hidden states of the decoder are responsible for the translation of target words, they should be able to predict the target words as well. The only difference is that we remove the already generated words from the prediction task. So each hidden state in the decoder is required to predict the target words which remain untranslated.\nFor the first state s1 of the decoder, the prediction task is similar with the task for the initial state. Since then, the prediction is no longer a separate training task, but integrated into each time step of the training process. We denote this mechanism as WPD.\nAs shown in Figure 2, for each time step j in the decoder, the hidden state sj is used for the prediction of (yj , yj+1, · · · , y|y|). The conditional probability of WPD is defined as:\nPWPD(yj , yj+1, · · · , y|y||y<j , x) (19)\n= |y|∏ k=j PWPD(yk|y<j , x)\nPWPD(yk|y<j , x) =fd(p(td([embyj−1 ; sj ; cj ]))) (20)\nwhere fd(·) and td(·) are the softmax layer and non-linear layer as defined in Equation 8-9; p(·) is another non-linear transformation layer, which prepares the current state for the prediction:\np(u) = tanh(Wpu).

Thus the computational complexity of our models for translation stays exactly the same.\nOn the other hand, using a smaller and specific vocabulary for each sentence or batch will improve translation efficiency. If the vocabulary is accurate enough, there is also a chance to improve the translation quality (Jean et al., 2015; Mi et al., 2016; L’Hostis et al., 2016). Our word prediction mechanism WPE provides a natural solution for generating a possible set of target words at sentence level. The prediction could be made from the initial state s0, without using extra resources such as word dictionaries, extracted phrases or frequent word lists, as in Mi et al. (2016)."

Adding word predic-\n2https://github.com/nyu-dl/dl4mt-tutorial\ntions to the hidden states in the decoder (WPD) leads to further improvements against baseNMT (4.15 BLEU), because WPD adds constraints to the state transitions through different time steps in the decoder.

We denote the set of top n words as Tn, the set of words in all the refer-\nences as R. We define the precision, recall of the word prediction as follows:\nprecision = |Tn ∩R| |Tn| ∗ 100% (28)\nrecall = |Tn ∩R| |R| ∗ 100% (29)\nWe compare the prediction performance of baseNMT and WPE. WPED has similar prediction results with WPE, so we omit its results. As shown in Table 5, baseNMT system has a relatively lower prediction precision, for example, 45% in top 10 prediction. With an explicit training, the WPE could achieve a much higher precision in all conditions. Specifically, the precision reaches 73% in top 10. This indicates that the initial state in WPE contains more specific information about the prediction of the target words, which may be a step towards better semantic representation, and leads to better translation quality.\nBecause the total words in the references are limited (around 50), the precision goes down, as expected, when a larger prediction set is considered. On the other hand, the recall of WPE is also much higher than baseNMT. When given 1k predictions, WPE could successfully predict 89% of the words in the reference. The recall goes up to 95% with 5k predictions, which is only 1/6 of the current vocabulary.\nTo analyze the process of word prediction, we draw the attention heatmap (Equation 16) between the initial state s0 and the bi-directional representation of each source side word hi for an example sentence. As shown in Figure 3, both examples show that the initial states have a very strong attention with all the content words in the source sentence. The blank cells are mostly functions words\nor high frequent tokens such as “de(’s)”, “shi(is)”, “er(and)”, “ta(it)”, comma and period.

The comparison is made in both translation quality and decoding time. As all our models with fixed vocabulary size have exactly the same number of parameters for decoding (extra mechanism is used only for training), we only plot the decoding time of the WPED for comparison. Figure 4 and 5 show the results.\nWhen we start the experiments with top 1k vocabulary (1/30 of the baseline settings), the translation quality of both WPE-V and WPED-V are already higher than the baseNMT; while their decoding time is less than 1/3 of an NMT system with 30k vocabulary. When the size of vocabulary increases, the translation quality improves as well. With a 6k predicted vocabulary (1/5 of the baseline settings), the decoding time is about 60% of a full-\nvocabulary system; the performances of both systems with variable size vocabulary are comparable their corresponding fixed-vocabulary systems, which is higher than the baseNMT by 2.53 and 4.53 BLEU, respectively.\nAlthough the comparison may not be fair enough due to the language pair and training conditions, the above relative improvements (e.g. WPED-V v.s. baseNMT) is much higher than previous research of manipulating the vocabularies (Jean et al., 2015; Mi et al., 2016; L’Hostis et al., 2016). This is because our mechanism is not only about reducing the vocabulary itself for each sentence or batch, it also brings improvement to the overall translation model. Please note that\nunlike these research, we keep the target vocabulary to be 30k in all our experiments, because we are not focusing on increasing the vocabulary size in this paper.

In the future, it might be helpful to analyze the benefits of jointly learning other related tasks together with machine translation, to provide further control of the learning process.

Later, attention mechanisms are proposed to enhance the source side representations (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015b). The source side context is computed at each time-step of decoding, based on the attention weights between the source side representations and the current hidden state of the decoder.

We argue that propagating errors through the end-to-end recurrent structures are not a direct way of control the hidden vectors. In this paper, we propose to use word predictions as a mechanism for direct supervision. More specifically, we require these vectors to be able to predict the vocabulary in target sentence. Our simple mechanism ensures better representations in the encoder and decoder without using any extra data or annotation. It is also helpful in reducing the target side vocabulary and improving the decoding efficiency. Experiments on Chinese-English and German-English machine translation tasks show BLEU improvements by 4.53 and 1.3, respectively.",
