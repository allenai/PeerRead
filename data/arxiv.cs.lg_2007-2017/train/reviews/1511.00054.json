We introduce a new approximation for large-scale Gaussian processes, the Gaussian Process Random Field (GPRF), in which local GPs are coupled via pairwise potentials. The GPRF likelihood is a simple, tractable, and parallelizeable approximation to the full GP marginal likelihood, enabling latent variable modeling and hyperparameter selection on large datasets. We demonstrate its effectiveness on synthetic spatial data as well as a real-world application to seismic event location.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 31 Oct 2015 01:02:14 GMT  (3253kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00054v1", "Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["david a moore", "stuart j russell"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.00054"}
