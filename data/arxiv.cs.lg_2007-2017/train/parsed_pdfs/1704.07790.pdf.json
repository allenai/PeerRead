      "text" : "Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) on Electronic Health Records (EHR) data is widely-used for early detection of diseases. Classical LDA for EHR data classification, however, suffers from two handicaps: the ill-posed estimation of LDA parameters (e.g., covariance matrix), and the “linear inseparability” of EHR data. To handle these two issues, in this paper, we propose a novel classifier FWDA — Fast Wishart Discriminant Analysis, that makes predictions in an ensemble way. Specifically, FWDA first surrogates the distribution of inverse covariance matrices using a Wishart distribution estimated from the training data, then “weightedaverages” the classification results of multiple LDA classifiers parameterized by the sampled inverse covariance matrices via a Bayesian Voting scheme. The weights for voting are optimally updated to adapt each new input data, so as to enable the nonlinear classification. Theoretical analysis indicates that FWDA possesses a fast convergence rate and a robust performance on high dimensional data. Extensive experiments on large-scale EHR dataset show that our approach outperforms stateof-the-art algorithms by a large margin."

      "text" : "The ubiquity of Electronic Health Records (EHR) [1, 2] in healthcare systems provides an unique opportunity for early detection of patients’ potential diseases using their historical health records. Existing researches on it first extract useful features, such as diagnosis-frequencies [1, 3, 2], pairwise diagnosis transition [4, 5], and graphs of diagnosis sequences [6], to represent each patient’s EHR data using the representation learning techniques. Then, supervised learning techniques are adopted to train predictive models, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Bayesian Network, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) [1, 3, 2, 4, 7].\nAmong these methods, LDA is frequently used as one of the common performance benchmarks [4, 7], because of LDA’s provable bayesian optimality [8]. However, recent studies demonstrate the limitation of LDA under high dimension low sample size (HDLSS) settings [9], such as the EHR records [10]. Because it is difficult to recover\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n07 79\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\nthe “true” parameters, e.g., covariance matrix, from a relatively small number of training samples. When the number of dimensions of EHR data is larger than the number of samples, the sample covariance estimation used in classical LDA, is singular and not invertible. In this case, LDA cannot produce any valid prediction. Even when the sample size is larger than the number of dimensions, the sample (inverse) covariance estimation could be quite different with the “true” (inverse) covariance matrix, with an inconsistent estimate of the largest eigenvalues and almost-orthogonal eigenvectors to the truth [11]. Such ill-posed estimation problem significantly degrades the performance of LDA. Moreover, EHR data is usually not linearly separable [1, 2].\nTo address the ill-posed problems and the linear inseparability of the data, several regularization-based methods have been proposed to accurately estimate the (inverse) covariance matrix [12, 13, 14] or linear coefficients [15, 16] under high dimension and low sample size settings [17]. Further, to handle the non-linearity, some kernel-based or nonparameteric LDA classifiers [18, 19, 20, 21] have been proposed. In summary, these methods intend to improve LDA classification through optimizing the parameters of LDA, such as (inverse) covariance matrices, linear projection metrics, or kernel settings, in a so-called optimal model selection manner [22].\nInstead of “bidding” the optimal parameter in the full and usually unknown parameter space, in this work, we intend to improve LDA in an ensemble way [23], while adapting to the new input data. Specifically, we first sample a set of (inverse) covariance matrices from the both training data and the new input data, then “weightedaverages” the classification results of multiple LDA classifiers parameterized by the sampled inverse covariance matrices via a Bayesian Voting Scheme [24]. Theoretical studies show that such Bayesian voting scheme can secure a wider margin and guarantee a good classification performance with a lower generalization error bound [24]. This theoretically guarantees that the proposed framework can “on average” outperform those regularization-based LDA classifiers using only single (inverse) covariance matrix estimator [25]. More importantly, the sampled (inverse) covariance matrices used by different LDA classifiers are updated with each new input data instance. In this way, the proposed classifier enables nonlinear classification by leveraging local information of the input data.\nHowever, the aforementioned Input-Adaptive Bayesian Voting Scheme is not computationally efficient. As the sampled (inverse) covariance matrices are assumed to be updated to adapt each new input data for classification, the sampling complexity is very high. Especially, when the number of dimensions of data is high, it is quite time-consuming to sample the (inverse) covariance matrices, while ensuring each sampled matrix is positive-semidefinite. Thus, we propose a novel method FWDA – Fast Wishart Discriminant Analysis, which can approximate the optimal prediction results with minimal sampling efforts.\nSpecifically, FWDA first surrogates the distribution of inverse covariance matrices using a Wishart distribution estimated from the training data, then a set of inverse covariance matrices are sampled based on the distribution. The “weighted-averaged” result over the classification results from LDA classifiers parameterized by these sampled inverse covariance matrices are used for prediction. The “weights” are updated by each new input data for classification optimally in a Bayes manner. In this way, FWDA can approximate to the aforementioned input-adaptive Bayesian voting schema,\nwith proven convergence rate. Our theoretical analysis further proves that (1) the error of approximation could quickly converge with the increasing number of sampled inverse covariance matrices m in speed O(m− 12 ); and (2) the error is not sensitive to the dimensions of the data, that means the performance of high dimensional data classification could be well-guaranteed.\nIn the rest of the paper, we first introduce the backgrounds, then we formulate the problem of research and elaborate the technical challenges in Section 2. In Section 3, we present the proposed algorithm FWDA, with the theoretical analysis on the approximation performance. In Section 4, we evaluate FWDA with other baseline algorithms for early detection of diseases using large-scale real EHR data. The results show that FWDA significantly outperforms baseline algorithms by a large margin."

Later, we briefly discuss the solution based on the typical LDA classifier.\nEHR Data Representation using Diagnosis-Frequency Vectors - There are many existing approaches to represent EHR data including the use of diagnosis-frequencies [1, 3, 2], pairwise diagnosis transition [4, 5], and graph representations of diagnosis sequences [6]. Among these approaches, the diagnosis-frequency is a common way to represent EHR data.\nGiven each patient’s EHR data, this method first retrieves the diagnosis codes [26] recorded during each visit. Next, the frequency of each diagnosis appearing in all past visits are counted, followed by further transformation on the frequency of each diagnosis into a vector of frequencies. For example, 〈1, 0, . . . , 3〉, where 0 means the second diagnosis does not exist in all past visits. In this paper, we denote the dimension of diagnosis-frequency vectors as p. Note that the dimension p of original codes is usually larger than 15, 000. Even using clustered codes, p is usually larger than 250 [27], while the number of samples for training n is frequently smaller than p.\nEarly Detection by Binary Classification - Given m training samples (i.e., EHR frequency vectors) along with corresponding labels i.e., (x1, l1) . . . (xn, ln) where li ∈ {−1,+1} refers to whether the patient i is diagnosed with the target disease or not, the early disease detection task is to determine if a new patient’s data vector x would develop into the target disease by classifying the vector x to +1 (positive) or −1 (negative)."

In our research, we named this pattern as Input Adaptive Bayesian Voting. Note that we take the new input vector x into account for generating the “hypothesis” Σ̂ of Bayesian inference.\nWith all above backgrounds and settings in mind, the problem of this research is to compute Equation 4. However, there exists at least two major technical challenges:\nChallenge I: Fast Computation and Lazy Sampling - To compute the integral in Eq. 4, a common solution is to leverage a Monte-Carlo Integration algorithm [28] that\nfirst randomly samples a group of positive-semidefinite matrices e.g., Σ1,Σ2 . . .Σm from the distribution with probability density function P (Σ̂|x1, x2, ...xn, x), then averages f(x, Σ̂) over the sampled positive-semidefinite matrices as 1/m ∑m i=1 f(x,Σi). This method can give an approximate result of Eq. 4. However, the density function of the sampled positive-semidefinite matrices P (Σ̂|x1, x2, ...xn, x) depends on the input x. That means, for each new testing sample x, we have to build a new probability distribution based on P (Σ̂|x1, x2, ...xm, x), then sample a new group of positivesemidefinite matrices and run the Monte-Carlo Integration accordingly. Obviously, the computational cost to re-sample a new group of positive-semidefinite matrices for each new input x is high. Thus, we need a “Lazy Sampling” mechanism, which only samples a group of positive-semidefinite matrices once, then uses the same group of matrices for arbitrary input x.\nChallenge II: Approximation and Convergence - The accuracy of classification highly depends on whether the proposed algorithm can approximate to the Eq. 4 as well as the convergence rate. For the high-dimensional numeric integration [29], the approximation is usually bottle-necked by the number of dimensions (e.g., the dimensionality of positive-semidefinite matrices p × p) and the sampling complexity (e.g., the number of sampled positive-semidefinite matrices m). Intuitively, the convergence of algorithms can be improved, with increasing sampling complexity and lower dimensionality. However, we aim at proposing an algorithm to approximate Eq. 4 with a low computational/sampling complexity while ensuring a fast convergence rate. Especially we require a convergence rate that is not sensitive to the dimensionality of the data p, so as to enable the high dimensional data classification.\nIn the rest of this paper, we present a novel classifier, Fast Wishart Discriminant Analysis – FWDA, which tackle the two research challenges, with low computational/sampling complexity and proven dimensionality-insensitive convergence rate.\n3 FWDA: Algorithms and Analysis In this section, we introduce our solution to compute Eq. 4 as follows: we first reformulate Eq. 4. Then, we introduce the algorithms of FWDA to compute the reformulation of Eq. 4. Finally, we analyze FWDA."

For any positive-semidefinite matrix Σ i.e., ∀Σ ≥ 0 and Θ = Σ−1, there exists P (Σ|x1, x2...xn) = Pw(Θ|T̂ , v), where Pw(Θ|T̂ , v) refers to the Wishart probability of Θ based on the mean positive-semidefinite matrix T̂ and v = n − 1.

Sampled inverse covariance matrices Θ1,Θ2, ..., Θm are i.i.d and all drawn from the Wishart distributionW(T̂ , v) with probability density function Pw(Θ|T̂ , v).

Among all diseases recorded in CHSN, we choose mental health disorders, including anxiety disorders, mood disorders, depression disorders, and other related disorders, as the targeted disease for early detection. We represent each patient using his/her diagnosis-frequency vector based on the clustered code set (the number of dimensions p = 295), where four clustered codes are considered to represent the diagnoses of mental health disorders and we do not predict these four types of mental disorders separately. Specifically, if a patient has any of\nthese four codes in his/her EHR, we say that he/she has been diagnosed with mental health disorders as ground truth.\nIn order to test the EARLY detection of diseases, for each patient with mental health disorders, we use his/her historical EHR data that was generated 90 days before he/she received the first mental health disorders diagnosis. Further, patients with less than two visits were excluded from the analysis.\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we compare our method with baseline algorithms in terms of the following metrics: Accuracy and F1-Score. Specifically, the Accuracy metric characterizes the proportion of patients who are accurately classified in the early detection of mental disorders. The F1-Score measures both correctness and completeness of the early detection.\nBaseline Algorithms - To validate the superiority of FWDA over classical LDA, we use six baseline approaches for comparison:\n• LDA – This algorithm is based on the common implementation of generalized Fishier’s discriminant analysis listed in Equation 1. Specifically, LDA uses the sample covariance estimation, and inverts the covariance matrix using pseudoinverse [37] when the matrix inverse is not available.\n• Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM-Linear) and SVM with Gaussian Kernels (SVM-G) - We compare our algorithm with both linear SVM (SVM-Linear) and nonlinear Kernel SVM with Gaussian Kernels (SVM-G). Both SVM classifiers are well-tuned among a wide range of parameters. Specifically, we report the performance of SVM-G classifiers with bandwidth parameter 0.1 and 1.0 in our research.\n• Decision Tree (D-Tree), Random Forest and AdaBoost - To compare our solution with the tree-based hypotheses, we use Decision Tree (D-Tree), and Random Forest for comparisons. Further, an AdaBoost classifier based on Logistic Regression is also used for comparison, as an advanced logistic regression baseline. Specifically, we report the performance of Random Forest and AdaBoost with 100 and 200 classifiers instances, respectively.\n• Two-stage LDA, Logistic Regression and LDA with Shrinkage Estimators - We also compared FWDA to other competitors including two-stage LDA [38, 39], logistic regression [40], and LDA with shrinkage estimators [12].\nWe perform experiments with the following settings: to build the training sets, we randomly select 50 to 500 patients with mental health disorders as the positive training samples, and randomly select the same number of patients not been diagnosed with any mental health disorders as negative training samples. Thus the training set for the two classes is balanced (i.e., the number of dimensions p = 295 and training set size is 50 ∼ 500× 2). To build the testing sets, we randomly select 200 patients (not included in the training set) from both positive/negative groups. Also the testing set is balanced.

Classical LDA for EHR data classification, however, suffers from two handicaps: the ill-posed estimation of LDA parameters (e.g., covariance matrix), and the “linear inseparability” of EHR data. To handle these two issues, in this paper, we propose a novel classifier FWDA — Fast Wishart Discriminant Analysis, that makes predictions in an ensemble way. Specifically, FWDA first surrogates the distribution of inverse covariance matrices using a Wishart distribution estimated from the training data, then “weightedaverages” the classification results of multiple LDA classifiers parameterized by the sampled inverse covariance matrices via a Bayesian Voting scheme. The weights for voting are optimally updated to adapt each new input data, so as to enable the nonlinear classification. Theoretical analysis indicates that FWDA possesses a fast convergence rate and a robust performance on high dimensional data. Extensive experiments on large-scale EHR dataset show that our approach outperforms stateof-the-art algorithms by a large margin.",
