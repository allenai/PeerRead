SGES retains the asymptotic correctness of GES but, unlike GES, has polynomial performance guarantees. In particular, we show that when data are sampled independently from a distribution that is perfect with respect to a DAG ${\\cal G}$ defined over the observable variables then, in the limit of large data, SGES will identify ${\\cal G}$'s equivalence class after a number of score evaluations that is (1) polynomial in the number of nodes and (2) exponential in various complexity measures including maximum-number-of-parents, maximum-clique-size, and a new measure called {\\em v-width} that is at least as small as---and potentially much smaller than---the other two. More generally, we show that for any hereditary and equivalence-invariant property $\\Pi$ known to hold in ${\\cal G}$, we retain the large-sample optimality guarantees of GES even if we ignore any GES deletion operator during the backward phase that results in a state for which $\\Pi$ does not hold in the common-descendants subgraph.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 6 Jun 2015 03:56:44 GMT  (835kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02113v1", "Full version of UAI paper"]], "COMMENTS": "Full version of UAI paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AI", "authors": ["david maxwell chickering", "christopher meek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.02113"}
