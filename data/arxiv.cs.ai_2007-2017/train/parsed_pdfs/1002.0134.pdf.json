To assess the impact of design decisions, instances of the five problem classes n-Queens, Golomb Ruler, Magic Square, Social Golfers, and Balanced Incomplete Block Design are modelled and solved with each solver. The results of the experiments are not meant to give an indication of the performance of a solver, but rather investigate what influence the choice of algorithms and data structures has.\nThe analysis of the impact of the design decisions focuses on the different ways of memory management, behaviour with increasing problem size, and specialised algorithms for specific types of variables. It also briefly considers other, less significant decisions."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Contemporary constraint solvers are very complex software systems. Each one of the many available today has its own characteristics, its own design decisions that the implementers made, and its own philosophy. The traits of a solver which will affect the performance for a particular problem class or instance often cannot be determined easily. Picking a particular solver is therefore a difficult task which requires specialist knowledge about each solver and is likely to have a significant impact on performance. On top of that, each solver has different ways of modelling problems. Not only do users need experience with a particular solver to model a problem in a way that enables it to be solved efficiently, but it is also hard to objectively compare solvers.\nThis paper studies a small selection of constraint solvers and assesses their performance on problem models which were made as similar as possible."

      "heading" : "2 Background",
      "text" : "The first constraint solvers were implemented as constraint logic programming environments in logic programming languages such as Prolog in the early 1980s. The logic programming paradigm lends itself naturally to solving constraint problems because things like depth-first backtracking search and nondeterminism are already built into the host language. Related ideas also arose in operations and artificial intelligence research.\nar X\niv :1\n00 2.\n01 34\nv1 [\ncs .A\nI] 3\n1 Ja\nn 20\n10\nNotable developments of that time include extensions to Prolog and the CHIP constraint programming system.\nStarting in the 1990s, constraint programming found its way to procedural and object-oriented languages, most notably C++. ILog Solver pioneered this area. It became apparent that it would be beneficial to separate the solving of constraint problems into two phases; modelling the problem and programming search.\nSince then, constraint solvers have improved significantly in terms of performance as well as in terms of ease of use.\nFor more detailed information on the history and background of each solver, see e.g. [8]."

      "text" : "The constraint solvers chosen for this paper are Choco [12], version 2.0.0.3, ECLiPSe [1], version 6.0 42, Gecode [10], version 2.2.0, and Minion [2][5], version 0.7. The solvers were chosen because all of them are currently under active development. Furthermore they are Open Source; implementation details not described in papers or the manual can be investigated by looking at the source code.\nTable 1 presents a brief summary of the solvers and their basic characteristics.\nChoco Choco was initially developed in the CLAIRE programming language as a national effort of French researchers for an open constraint solver for teaching and research purposes. Since then, it has been reimplemented in the Java programming language and gone through a series of other changes. Version 2 is a major refactoring to provide a better separation between modelling and solving a problem, as well as performance improvements.\nECLiPSe ECLiPSe is one of the oldest constraint programming environment which is still used and in active development. It was initially developed at the European Computer-Industry Research Centre in Munich, and then at IC-Parc, Imperial College in London until the end of 2005, when it became Open Source. Being implemented in Prolog, its intrinsic performance is not as high as comparable systems implemented in other programming languages, but it is easier to specify problems and implement new algorithms.\nGecode “Gecode is an open, free, portable, accessible, and efficient environment for developing constraint-based systems and applications in research,\nindustry, and education. Particularly important for its design is simplicity and accessibility. Simplicity has been the key reason why Gecode is efficient and successfully exploits today’s commodity parallel hardware. Accessibility is due to its complete reference documentation, growing tutorial documentation, and academic publications in conferences and journals presenting key design decisions and techniques.”1\nMinion Minion was implemented to be a solver which only requires an input file to run and no written code. This way the solver could be made fast by not being extensible or programmable and fixing the design decisions. It also makes it easier to use because users do not have to write code."

      "text" : "The classes of constraint problems investigated are the n-Queens, Golomb Ruler, Magic Square, Social Golfers, and Balanced Incomplete Block Design problems. The characteristics of the problems are [4]:-\nn-Queens Place n queens on an n × n chessboard such that no queen is attacking another queen.\nGolomb Ruler (CSPLib problem 6) A Golomb ruler may be defined as a set of m integers 0 = a1 < a2 < . . . < am such that the m(m−1)2 differences aj − ai, 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m are distinct. Such a ruler is said to contain m marks and is of length am. The length is to be minimised.\nMagic Square (CSPLib problem 19) An order n magic square is a n×n matrix containing the numbers 1 to n2, with each row, column and main diagonal equal the same sum n(n\n2+1) 2 .\nSocial Golfers (CSPLib problem 10) In a golf club where m groups of n golfers play over p weeks, schedule the groups such that no golfer plays in the same group as any other golfer twice.\nBalanced Incomplete Block Design (CSPLib problem 28) A Balanced Incomplete Block Design (BIBD) is defined as an arrangement of v distinct objects into b blocks such that each block contains exactly k distinct objects, each object occurs in exactly r different blocks, and every two distinct objects occur together in exactly λ blocks. The parameters b and r can be derived from the other ones.\nThe choices cover a variety of different constraint problems, such as optimisation problems and problems usually modelled with integer and Boolean variable domains. The models involve binary constraints as well as global constraints.\nFor each problem class, several different instances were chosen. This choice was purely based on the CPU time of the models to be able to compare both long and short runs. The instances selected were:-\n1Personal communication with Christian Schulte.\nn-Queens n = {20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29}\nGolomb Ruler m = {9, 10, 11, 12, 13}\nMagic Square n = {4, 5, 6}\nSocial Golfers 〈p,m, n〉 = {〈2, 4, 4〉 , 〈2, 5, 4〉 , 〈2, 6, 4〉 , 〈2, 7, 4〉 , 〈2, 8, 4〉 , 〈2, 9, 4〉 , 〈2, 10, 4〉}\nBIBD 〈v, k, λ〉 = {〈7, 3, 10〉 , 〈7, 3, 20〉 , 〈7, 3, 30〉 , 〈7, 3, 40〉 , 〈7, 3, 50〉 , 〈7, 3, 60〉 , 〈7, 3, 70〉}\nThere is insufficient space to reproduce the models for all the problems; instead, a high-level description of the model for each problem class will be given.\nThe models were derived from the examples included with the distributions of the solvers. For some solvers and some problems the example model was simply adapted to match the models for the other solvers, in other cases the problem was modelled from scratch.\nn-Queens The problem was modelled with n variables, one for each queen, and one auxiliary variable for each pair of rows holding the difference of the column positions of queens in those rows to enforce the constraint that no two queens can be on the same diagonal. An alldifferent constraint was enforced over the n decision variables.\nGolomb Ruler The Golomb Ruler model had m variables, one for each tick, and one auxiliary variable for each pair of ticks to hold the difference between them. Additional constraints determined the value of the first tick to be 0 and enforced an increasing monotonic ordering on the ticks. An alldifferent constraint was enforced over the auxiliary variables holding the differences between the ticks. The optimisation constraint minimised the value of the last tick, which is equivalent to the length am.\nMagic Square There were n × n variables for the cells of the magic square. The constraints enforced all those variables to be different and all rows, columns, and diagonals to sum to the magic sum. Additionally, four constraints were introduced to break some of the symmetries in the problem; the number in the top left square has to be less than or equal to the numbers in the other corners of the square and the top right number has to be less than or equal to the bottom left number.\nSocial Golfers The model of the Social Golfers problem used a p×m× (n ·m) matrix of decision variables. The first dimension represented the weeks, the second one the groups, and the third one the players by group. The constraints imposed were that each player plays exactly once per week, the sum of the players in each group is equal to the number of players per group specified, and each pair of players meets at most once. For the last constraint, one auxiliary variable for each pair of players by group times weeks times groups was introduced. Additional ordering constraints were introduced to break the symmetries among weeks, groups, and players.\nBalanced Incomplete Block Design The BIBD model introduced a matrix of v × b decision variables. The rows were constrained to sum to r, the columns to k, and the scalar product between each pair of rows was constrained to equal λ. For the last constraint, one auxiliary constraint per pair of rows times b was introduced. To break some of the symmetries, ordering constraints were put on each pair of rows and each pair of columns.\nAll models except the BIBD and Social Golfers ones used variables with integer domains. The models of BIBD and Social Golfers used Boolean variables in the solvers which provide specialised Boolean variables; Choco, Gecode, and Minion. For all models, static variable and value ordering heuristics were used. The solutions the different solvers found for each problem were the same.\nTable 2 lists the number of variables, their domains, and constraints for each problem instance. If the domains of the auxiliary variables are different from the domains of the main variables, they are given in parentheses. Minion does not provide a sum equals constraint; it can however be emulated by combining a sum less than and sum greater than constraint. This results in a higher number of constraints for Minion; it is given in parentheses.\nThe purpose of this paper is to compare the solvers on equivalent models to be able to assess how the design decisions they have made affected their performance. The models of the problems are in no case the optimal model for the particular solver or the particular problem. The results cannot be seen as providing a performance comparison of the solvers in general, as for such a comparison the models would have to be tailored to each solver to achieve the best performance. For such a comparison, see [7].\nThis paper focuses on performance in terms of processor time; other measures such as wall clock time and memory requirements are not evaluated."

This was ensured by comparing the node counts for each instance for the solvers which provide node counts, visually inspecting the search tree for solvers which provide visualisation tools, and manually comparing the decisions made at each node of the search tree for smaller instances.\nThe node count numbers are not reported here because because they are only meaningful in the context of also using other means to compare the amount of search being done."

      "text" : "The following figures show the performance of the solvers for each problem class and instance.\nAll experiments were conducted on an 8-core Intel Xeon 2.66 GHz with 16 GB of memory running CentOS Linux 5. The CPU time was measured with the time command-line utility. The numbers reported as CPU time are the sum of user and system time. The median of five runs was taken. The coefficient\nof variation2 was in general less than 10%. Instances where it was larger are discussed below.\nThe figures show that for the Magic Square problem models, Gecode finds the solution first. For the Golomb Ruler problem model, Gecode and Minion show a very similar performance. For the other problem models, Minion was fastest.\nFigure 6 shows the median number of nodes per second Minion did for each problem class and instance. A high number of nodes per second indicates that the amount of work done at each node – i.e. propagation of changes – is small and more search than propagation is done. For the Social Golfers and the Balanced Incomplete Block Design problems the number of nodes per second decreases with increasing problem size after a certain threshold. This indicates the point where managing backtrack memory at each node becomes so expensive that instantiating new nodes has a significant cost.\nOn the instances of the n-Queens problem, the Magic Square problem, and the Golomb Ruler problem more propagation and less search compared to the other problems is performed. Due to the larger domains and fewer variables, the solvers spend a larger ratio of the total CPU time propagating changes and revising domains than instantiating new search nodes in the tree and restoring backtrack state.\nFigure 1 shows that the relative differences in CPU time between the solvers stays approximately the same across different instances, save for very small problems where the setup cost dominates the CPU time (cf. section 5.2). The same effect is even stronger for the Golomb Ruler problem (figure 2) where the total CPU times are larger. The gradients of the lines for the different solvers are strikingly similar.\n2The coefficient of variation is the standard deviation divided by the mean.\nFigure 3 suggests a slightly different behaviour for the Magic Square problem; however, there are not enough data points to draw a definitive conclusion. This problem was only run up to instances of size 6 because instances of size 7 took too long.\nThese results suggest that there is no intrinsic advantage of one implementation of propagation algorithms and data structures over another except for a constant overhead caused by the overall implementation. They also suggest that for problems with large variable domains the cost of propagation at each node dominates the cost of instantiating new nodes and restoring backtrack state regardless of the implementation of backtrack memory.\nThe coefficient of variation between the five runs for the 2,10,4 Social Golfers instance for Gecode was about 20%. Even considering the large variation, the key point – ECLiPSe performs better than Gecode, which is roughly the same as Choco – remains valid.\nIt is obvious from all figures that the performance differences between different solvers can easily be several orders of magnitude. The overall performance of a solver is affected by a variety of factors. One of them is the programming language the solver is implemented in; others are the design decisions made when implementing it. The following sections each look at one of these design issues and assess its influence qualitatively and quantitatively. There are design decisions which are not dealt with here; however we believe that the ones addressed in this paper are the most influential ones."

      "heading" : "5.1 Specialised variable implementations",
      "text" : "The Choco, Gecode, and Minion solvers provide specialised variable implementations for Boolean variables. The Social Golfers and BIBD problems have been modelled with Boolean variables and integer variables with domains {0..1} to assess the impact of the specialised implementation.\nECLiPSe provides no variable types and uses floating point arithmetic for everything, which gives it an inherent disadvantage over the other solvers.\nFigure 7 shows the relative CPU time the model with integer variables takes compared to the model with Boolean variables. The CPU time is shown in relation with the number of backtracks because the correlation between the CPU time and the number of backtracks is stronger than the correlation between the CPU time and the number of variables [11].\nThe results were compared with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test [13]. The differences for both problems for Gecode and Minion are statistically significant at the 0.05 level; however the differences for Choco are not statistically significant.\nAs the figure demonstrates, the specialised implementation for Boolean variables is most effective for Minion, where the improvements over the model with integer variables are up to more than 7 times. For Gecode the improvements in terms of CPU time are also up to approximately 100%. The specialised implementation in Choco does not achieve any significant performance improvement at all; the differences are just random noise.\nThe results also show that for Minion the improvement of the Boolean model over the integer model increases as the number of backtracks increases whereas for Gecode there is no such effect. For the smallest number of backtracks for both the Social Golfers and the Balanced Incomplete Block Design problems,\nthe improvement for Choco and Gecode is larger than the improvement for Minion.\nMinion provides a specialised implementation for the sum constraint, which is used heavily in the Social Golfers and BIBD problems for variables with Boolean domains. Gecode provides specialised Boolean implementations for all constraints used in the models. Choco only provides a more efficient implementation of the domain for Boolean variables.\nThe management of backtrack memory in Minion is slightly different for Boolean and integer variables; for Boolean variables no trailing but only copying is performed while for integer variables some additional trailing occurs. To assess the effects of the specialised constraint implementation and introduction of trailing separately, the Minion source code was modified and trailing switched off for integer variables for the experiments described above.\nThe experiments were repeated with the unmodified source code of Minion. The results showed the same picture; only the improvement of the Boolean model over the integer model was not as significant as trailing integer variables improves the performance slightly.\nThe results show that providing specialised implementations for different variable types can achieve considerate performance improvements. The performance improvement can be significant, as shown by Gecode and especially Minion. It even increases for Minion as more variables are involved in the global constraints and the size of the search tree increases."

      "heading" : "5.2 Setup costs and scaling",
      "text" : "In all of the experiments except the Golomb Ruler problem, Gecode is the fastest solver for the problem which takes least CPU time to solve. As the time required to solve the problem increases, its CPU time increases more in relative terms than that of the other solvers such that it is not the fastest solver anymore.\nBoth Choco and ECLiPSe run in abstract machines which have to be set up when the program starts. Minion reads an input file, parses it, and constructs the problem to solve from that. The overhead incurred because of these issues accounts for the differences in CPU time compared to Gecode for the small problems. For the Golomb Ruler problem, the CPU time Gecode takes to solve the smallest problem is equal to the time Minion takes. This is because the CPU time required to solve this instance is large compared to the CPU required for the smallest instances of the other problem classes – it takes roughly a second whereas for other problem classes the smallest instance is solved in a fraction of a second. The overhead Minion incurs by parsing the input file accounts only for a small fraction of the total CPU time and therefore it is as fast as Gecode.\nFigure 4 shows that for the Social Golfers problem, ECLiPSe scales better than the other solvers with respect to the increase in CPU time with increasing problem size. From the 2,7,4 instance, it is faster than Choco, and for the largest instance it is faster than Gecode as well. Extrapolating past the end of the graph, it is possible that for very large instances ECLiPSe could be faster than Minion.\nFigure 5 on the other hand shows a different picture. Here the relative increase in CPU time ECLiPSe and Gecode require to solve the problem as it becomes more difficult to solve is significantly larger than that of Choco and Minion. For the 7,3,60 problem instance, Choco is faster than Gecode despite being slower before.\nBoth graphs are strikingly similar when disregarding ECLiPSe. For both problems, the relative distance between the lines for Choco and Minion stays more or less the same, whereas Gecode is about the same as Minion for the smallest problem and about the same as Choco for the largest problem.\nBoth the Social Golfers and BIBD problem classes have a large number of variables and constraints. The key difference is that on instances of the Social Golfers problem, more backtracks are performed (cf. table 3). This indicates that the implementation of backtracking and restoration of previous state for problems with many variables is implemented more efficiently in ECLiPSe than in the other solvers.\nThe following sections look at memory management in more detail."

      "text" : "Gecode provides parameters which can be given to the solver executable to tune the ratio of copying vs. recomputation. The n-Queens problem, the Social Golfers problem, and the Balanced Incomplete Block Design problem were rerun with recomputation distances of 1 (full copying – the same behaviour as Minion), 8 (the default), 16, and 32. The adaptive recomputation distance was left at the default value of 2 [9].\nThe results were compared with the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance test [6]. The differences are not statistically significant because of the large variation among the CPU times for the problem instances; however when comparing the differences between doing a full copy at each node (recomputation distance 1) and the other recomputation distances with the Wilcoxon test the differences were statistically significant at the 0.05 level.\nFigure 8 shows the results for all the problems and recomputation distances. The CPU times of the runs with a recomputation distance > 1 are divided by the CPU times for a recomputation distance of 1. Values larger than 1 mean that doing a full copy at every node performs better than a recomputation distance of > 1. Note that the default recomputation distance in Gecode is 8, i.e. the results shown in figures 1, 4, and 5 are not the CPU times which the other CPU times are divided by.\nThe CPU time is influenced by both the number of backtracks and the number of variables; however for this comparison the correlation between CPU time and number of backtracks was stronger than the correlation between CPU time and number of variables.\nFor all instances and recomputation distances of the n-Queens problem, making a full copy at every node of the search tree performs better than a recomputation distance > 1. This suggests that for problems with only few variables it is better to always copy. The performance improvement is only up to about 22% though.\nThe Social Golfers and Balanced Incomplete Block Design problems show that for problems with many variables, it is cheaper not to copy at every node, but to do some recomputation. The results show that the performance improvement can be up to about 70% with recomputation. They also demonstrate that the optimal recomputation distance increases as the number of backtracks increases. For both the Social Golfers and the Balanced Incomplete Block Design, the default recomputation distance of 8 performs best for all but the largest instance of the respective problem, where the recomputation distance of 16 is better.\nFurthermore there appears to be a problem-specific threshold in terms of number of backtracks which marks a change in the performance improvement for copying at every node – before the threshold the improvement increases with increasing number of backtracks, after the threshold it decreases.\nFigure 4 for example shows that Minion performs better than Gecode despite full copying and no recomputation. This is because Gecode and Minion use different implementations of copying backtrack memory. Whereas Gecode keeps a list of pointers to objects to be copied and traverses that list, Minion allocates everything that needs to be restored when backtracking in a continuous memory region and simply copies the whole region. The advantage of Gecode’s approach is that a finer-grained control over the used memory is possible, but Minion’s approach wins in terms of overhead when copying at every node.\nChoco provides a facility to change the backtrack strategy to both recomputation and copying as well; however not a combination of the two. Using only recomputation performed worse than copying by several orders of magnitude and is therefore not considered here."

The CPU times are shown in relation to the number of backtracks because the correlation between the CPU time and the number of backtracks is stronger than the correlation between the CPU time and the number of variables.\nFigure 9 shows the results.

The results for the Social Golfers and the Balanced Incomplete Block Design problems show that the relative difference between trailing and copying backtrack memory increases as the number of backtracks increases.\nThe results suggest that trailing backtrack memory performs better than copying backtrack memory; especially with increasing number of backtracks and variables. This is most likely limited to Choco though; Minion for example\nuses a different implementation of copying backtrack memory which scales much better with increasing number of variables and has less overhead – instead of copying each variable domain individually, it only copies one contiguous memory region.\nIn general the results show that for problems with many backtracks trailing backtrack memory performs better than copying backtrack memory. The following section investigates this further."

      "heading" : "5.3.3 Sensitivity to number of variables",
      "text" : "To further assess the impact of the backtrack strategy on the overall performance of the solvers, the n-Queens and the Social Golfers problems were remodelled with more auxiliary Boolean variables. No additional constraints were imposed on the variables to keep the amount of search the same. Table 5 summarises the numbers of variables for the normal and for the extended model.\nThe increased number of variables should have no or little impact on performance for solvers which use trailed memory for backtracking as they only record the changes to variables and the additional variables are never changed. The impact for solver which use other types of backtrack strategies should be considerable. Any effects caused by the different types of backtrack memory should be much more significant for the Social Golfers problem instances than for the n-Queens problem instances because of the significantly higher number of backtracks (cf. table 3).\nThe purpose of these experiments is twofold. First, to assess the influence the implementation of backtrack memory when more variables are added, and second, an estimation of the fraction of total CPU time which is spent managing backtrack memory. This can be estimated from the influence of the backtrack\nstrategy on the total CPU time. The results for each solver and problem class were compared with the Wilcoxon test. The differences for the n-Queens problem are statistically significant at the 0.05 level. For the Social Golfers problem the differences for Choco, ECLiPSe, and Minion are significant at the 0.05 level; the differences for Gecode are not statistically significant.\nFigure 10 shows the CPU time of the extended model over the CPU time of the normal model. The solver which is affected most by the change is obviously Minion; followed by Gecode. The differences of up to about 35% for Gecode suggest that it is affected, but the variation between individual runs is too much to make the differences statistically significant. Choco and ECLiPSe are affected to a much lesser extent.\nThe results correspond exactly to the expectations. Minion takes the biggest hit in terms of performance because it uses copying for backtrack memory and has to copy more data. Gecode combines copying with recomputation and is therefore less affected, as no recomputation has to be performed for the additional variables. Both Choco and ECLiPSe do trailing and are least affected by the addition of more variables.\nFigure 10 also shows that the CPU time of the model with more variables increases for Gecode and Minion as the number of backtracks (and therefore the size of the search tree) increases. For Choco and ECLiPSe it stays approximately the same. Again, this result is expected because while for copying backtrack memory the amount of work to be done increases at each node, it stays approximately the same for trailing backtrack memory.\nThe number of variables and backtracks for the n-Queens problem instances are much less than for the Social Golfers instances (cf. tables 5 and 3) and therefore the expected effects are less significant. The differences for Minion\nstand out from the differences for the other solvers, suggesting that it is the only one which was truly affected by the changes. The differences are significantly smaller than for the Social Golfers problem though.\nThe results show that managing backtrack memory can account for a significant part of the total CPU time. Adding new variables without any constraints on them does not increase the work to be done for propagating changes, but nevertheless the total CPU time can increase significantly. For the remodelled n-Queens problem the differences for Minion are up to about 23% even though more work is done propagating changes than exploring the search tree (cf. discussion for figure 6). For the Social Golfers problem, which has many more variables (cf. table 5), the proportion of the CPU time spent on managing backtrack memory is even larger; the differences are up to about 50% for Minion."

The n-Queens, the Social Golfers, and the Balanced Incomplete Block Design problem classes were rerun with garbage collection turned off.\nThe results were compared to the results with garbage collection switched on with the Wilcoxon test. The differences are statistically significant at the 0.01 level.\nThe results are shown in relation to the number of backtracks because the correlation between CPU time and the number of backtracks is stronger than the correlation between CPU time and the number of variables.\nFigure 11 shows that the CPU times for the runs with garbage collection\nswitched off are up to about 35% higher than those with garbage collection switched on for the Social Golfers problem. The CPU times for Balanced Incomplete Block Design are similar, but less pronounced. A possible reason for that is the lower number of backtracks. The amount of memory that the n-Queens instances use is so small that the differences are not significant.\nThe results show that the benefits of garbage collection do not only include a smaller memory footprint, but also increases in performance in terms of CPU time. These results may not be applicable for other implementations of backtrack memory though. The second key point which can be concluded from figure 11 is that while garbage collection can improve performance up to a certain number of backtracks, the improvements become smaller as the number of backtracks and the total amount of memory the problem requires grows. It is conceivable that for much larger problem instances than investigated here, the CPU time with garbage collection becomes larger than the CPU time without garbage collection."

Only the alldifferent constraint is used in the n-Queens, the Golomb Ruler, and the Magic\nSquare problems. Gecode orders the propagators according the complexity of the propagation function, which is defined when the propagator is implemented. Experiments for some problem instances were conducted with the propagator queue reversed.

For the particular models used in this paper the same constraints were used and this did not have any negative impact in terms of performance; for other applications it simplifies modelling problems though and is therefore also likely to have an impact on performance. For example the n-Queens problem could be modelled without auxiliary variables in Choco, ECLiPSe, and Gecode and is likely to be perform better than a model of the same problem in Minion which has to use auxiliary variables.\nOn the other hand Minion provides an implementation of the sum constraints with watched literals, which could improve its performance [3].\nAn interesting point is that Minion does not have a sum-equals constraint, but only sum-greater-or-equal and sum-less-or-equal constraints. The semantics of the sum-equals constraint can be achieved by combining the two constraints, but this increases the total number of constraints; in some cases considerably. Nevertheless there does not seem to be a negative impact on performance, on the contrary. This indicates that the most obvious way to implement a constraint may not always be the most efficient one."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion",
      "text" : "We presented a comprehensive comparison and evaluation of the implementation design decisions in state-of-the-art constraint problem solvers. The experiments provide not only a qualitative, but also a quantitative comparison of different implementation approaches.\nThe results show that choosing one design decision over another when implementing a constraint solver does not usually give performance benefits in general. The exception are specialised variable implementations – implementing specialised versions of constraints and propagators for the different variable types improves performance significantly.\nThe design decisions associated with memory management, such as backtrack memory, are much harder to classify. Depending on the problem to solve and the number of variables and constraints involved, a particular implementation of memory management will perform better than others. This does not only depend on the type of problem, but also on the size of the problem though. The results do show however that memory management can account for a significant part of the total CPU time required to solve a problem.\nThe large differences among the CPU times the individual solvers take emphasise the importance of choosing the right solver for a given task. This decision is absolutely crucial to performance. In an ideal world, a solver would, given a particular problem, adapt its design decisions and provide an implementation specialised for this problem.\nThe performance of the individual solvers in the experiments should not be taken as a benchmark or as a suggestion which of these solvers to use for a given problem. The focus of the experiments was to compare the solvers on models which are as similar as possible. For any other application, the problem model will be tuned for a particular solver to use its specific strengths which cannot be compared here. It is entirely possible that with a carefully-tuned model a solver which performs badly in an experiment reported here becomes much better than any other solver."

To assess the impact of design decisions, instances of the five problem classes n-Queens, Golomb Ruler, Magic Square, Social Golfers, and Balanced Incomplete Block Design are modelled and solved with each solver. The results of the experiments are not meant to give an indication of the performance of a solver, but rather investigate what influence the choice of algorithms and data structures has. The analysis of the impact of the design decisions focuses on the different ways of memory management, behaviour with increasing problem size, and specialised algorithms for specific types of variables. It also briefly considers other, less significant decisions.",
