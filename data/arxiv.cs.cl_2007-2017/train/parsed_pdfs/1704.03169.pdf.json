      "text" : "Recently, neural-based sequence generation models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in machine translation (Wu et al., 2016). Neural machine translation (NMT) models normally utilize recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as decoders to generate output tokens sequentially. In the decoding phase, it is a common practice to use the beam search algorithm to find a candidate translation, which approximately maximizes the posterior probability.\nAlthough beam search can find much better candidates compared to greedy decoding, sometimes it still produces inappropriate outputs. Szegedy et al. (2016) has shown that a neural network can become too confident in a suboptimal prediction. In beam search, assigning high probability to a suboptimal prediction in one step may lead to a\nchain reaction that generates unnatural output sequences.\nTo improve beam search, various approaches have been explored recently either by enhancing the scoring method (Li et al., 2016) or using reinforcement learning (Li et al., 2017; Gu et al., 2017). In this work, we try to apply Minimum Bayes-Risk (MBR) decoding (Kumar and Byrne, 2004) to guide the decoding algorithm of NMT to find a better candidate. This approach exploits the similarity between candidate translations instead of predicting the quality of each single candidate.\nIn preliminary experiments, we found that simply reranking the results of NMT by their Bayes risks only works with a large beam size. However, we are facing two major difficulties when integrating the MBR reranking into beam search.\nFirstly, we found that performing MBR reranking simultaneously with beam search does not work. MBR reranking shrinks the diversity of the candidate space, thus traps the decoding algorithm in a suboptimal search space. Moreover, as the probability of a partial translation cannot represent final confidence, the values of Bayes risks are inaccurate in the beginning.\nSecondly, as MBR reranking requires computingN×N discrepancy values to obtains the Bayes risks for N candidates, CPU-based MBR reranking is excessively time-consuming.\nIn this paper, we propose to perform MBR decoding at a later stage to search for a “refined” candidate with low Bayes risk. To speed up MBR decoding, we designed two approaches to compute the Bayes risks on GPU, which are shown to be much faster than a standard implementation. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as two folds:\n1. We found that MBR reranking only works with a large beam size.

      "text" : "MBR decoding is widely applied in SMT (Kumar and Byrne, 2004; González-Rubio et al., 2011; Duh et al., 2011), which is also found to improve the translation quality (Ehling et al., 2007). Recently, Stahlberg et al. (2016) utilized the translation lattice of SMT to guide NMT decoding with the MBR decision rule, which is shown to be better than simply rescoring the N-best results of SMT. A drawback of this approach is that it requires a SMT system to be available and decode simultaneously with the NMT model.\nRecently, some studies are proposed to enhance beam search with reinforcement learning. Li et al. (2017) utilizes a simplified version of the actorcritic model to decode for arbitrary decoding objectives. The scoring function is modified to be an interpolation of the log probability and the output of the value function (or Q function). Gu et al. (2017) extends the noisy, parallel approximate decoding (NPAD) algorithm (Cho, 2016) by adjusting the hidden states in recurrent networks with an agent, which is trained with the deterministic policy gradient algorithm (Silver et al., 2014). These approaches predict the quality of each single candidate, whereas MBR reranking considers the relation between multiple candidates. Therefore, they can be combined with our model to further improve the quality of output sequences."

      "text" : "In this section, we propose a simple decoding strategy, which searches for low-risk hypotheses after finishing beam search. The basic idea is to utilize the results of beam search as an evidence space to guide the later-stage MBR decoding.\nAs the hypotheses1 that were discarded by beam search provide good starting points for finding low-risk hypotheses, we begin the later-stage decoding from a selection of discarded hypotheses rather than from scratch. To do this, in each step of beam search, we save B discarded hypotheses that are outside the “beam” to a hypothesis list H , where B is the number of beam size. After beam search, we select top B finished hypotheses2, and save them to an evidence space E.\nAfter we collected the discarded hypotheses in H and the evidences in E from beam search, we perform the later-stage MBR decoding for an extra T steps to recover low-risk hypotheses. In our experiments, T is fixed to be the number of input words.\nIn each extra step, we sort3 the hypothesis list\n1Each hypothesis is a tuple of the average log probability, candidate tokens, and the lastly computed hidden state of the decoder LSTM.\n2A hypothesis is finished when a “EOS” token is reached. 3As computing S(y) for all hypotheses in H is timeconsuming, in practice, we only rerank top 3×B hypotheses\nH with a score function, which will be described later in Section 4.1. Then we pick B hypotheses with the highest scores from H , and generate the next words for them, resulting in B × B new hypotheses. If a hypothesis is finished, we add it to the evidence space E. Otherwise, it is put back to the hypothesis list H .\nFinally, after performing the later-stage MBR decoding for T steps, we select the candidate translation with the lowest risk in E as the output. The complete algorithm is summarized in Alg. 1."

To achieve this, we select the hypotheses in H to decode according to a score function computed for each hypothesis y in each extra step, which is computed as follows:\nS(y) = 1\n|y| log p(y|x)− αR(y)− βL(y). (2)\nwhere the first part of the equation is the average log probability. The risk term R(y) is computed by Eq. 1.\nHowever, reranking with R(y) alone will overpenalize short hypotheses as they are certainly dissimilar to the finished hypotheses inE. Therefore, we add a length penalty term L(y) to encourage the selection of short hypotheses, which is proportional to the number of remaining steps:\nL(y) = (T − t) · |y|. (3)\nIn the last step of MBR decoding when t = T , as L(y) will be zero, the hypotheses are selected only by their confidence scores and risks."

The advantage of the approximation approach is that the implementation is independent of the chosen criterion of discrepancy. In practice, we found that reranking with approximated discrepancies performs as good as a standard reranker.\nFor the GPU-based BLEU computation, the trick is to construct a count vector that contains the counts of all unique n-grams to compute matches. The implementational details are described in the supplementary material.\nThe neural-based approach approximates true discrepancy values with a simple LSTM, which can be computed in batches naturally:\nht = LSTMθ(E(yt),ht−1), (5) h′l = LSTMθ(E(y ′ l),h ′ l−1), (6)\n∆(y1:t, y ′ 1:l) = h > t h ′ l + v > θ (ht + h ′ l) + bθ .

(2016), we apply the REINFORCE algorithm (Williams, 1992) to learn the optimal weights (α and β) for each input. The difference is that we do not discretize the weights to make a finite action space. Instead, we directly apply REINFORCE algorithm to learn a Gaussian policy with continuous actions. The merit of this approach is that we do not need to find the effective range of each weight value beforehand.\nWe use the last state of the backward encoder LSTM in the NMT model to represent an input sequence, which is denoted by s. The stochastic policy is defined as:\nµ = f(s;θµ) (8)\nσ = softplus(f(s;θσ)) (9)\nπ(a|s;θ) = |A|∏ i=1\n1 σi √ 2π exp\n( − (ai − µi) 2\n2σ2i ) (10)\nwhere |A| is the number of actions, which equals 2 in our case.

The results show that both GPU-based approaches are much faster than a standard CPU-based reranker, thus capable of being integrated into beam search.

On the contrary, MBR reranking improves the scores when a large beam size is used, but less effective with a small beam size. Later-stage MBR decoding is shown to outperform the simple MBR reranking in all settings of beam size.\nAdditionally, we also found that the number of candidates in the evidence space largely affects the effectiveness of MBR reranking. In our experiments, the number of evidences is fixed to the same number of beam size. Using more evidences degrades the quality of selected candidates."

      "text" : "A.1 A Note on the Standard Implementation for Computing Bayes Risks\nAs in the equation for computing R(y), all the terms in the summation are positive numbers, we stop computing the risk of a candidate if the sum is already higher than the lowest risk value of computed candidates. Even with this early stopping technique, the standard MBR reranker still runs very slow as shown in Fig. 1 of the paper.\nA.2 GPU-based BLEU Computation For the particular discrepancy function based on BLEU, we found that a matrix of N × N BLEU values can be calculated efficiently on GPU. The trick is to build a M -dimensional count vector ci for each candidate yi, which contains the count of all M uniq n-grams in the candidate space. Another vector g is used to indicate the rank of each n-gram.\nFor example, let a set of n-grams be {“a”, “in”, “park”, “ball”, “in a”, “a park”}. Then for the sentence “a park in a park”, ci will be a 6-dimensional vector of {2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2}, whereas g will be a vector of {1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2}.\nThe BLEU score of a candidate pair can be computed with:\npi,j = 1\n4 4∑ n=1 log ∑M k=1 I(gk = n) ·min(cik, c j k)\n|yi|+ 1− n (11)\nBLEU(yi, yj) = exp(min(1− |y j | |yi| , 0) + pi,j)\n(12)\nIn this way, a N ×N BLEU matrix can be obtained in one shot with an input of N ×M count matrix. In practice, we use smoothed BLEU, which simply adds 1 to both top and bottom parts of the fraction in Eq. 11.\nA.3 Training details of Neural-based Bayes-risk Approximation\nTo learn a neural-based estimator that approximates the discrepancy matrix, we collect 100K candidate pairs by decoding the source sentences in the training data. For each input sentence, a new ID is assigned for each unique token in the candidate space to reduce the vocabulary size. For example, “A cat eats” and “A dog eats” will be converted to {0, 1, 3} and {0, 2, 3} respectively.\nThe model is trained with MSE loss function to predict 1 − BLEU(y, y′) given a candidate pair. We use Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) and train the model for 50 epoch. The learning rate is fixed to 0.0001. In practice, we scale the discrepancy scores by 0.1. After 50 epochs, we obtain a MSE loss of 0.06.\nA.4 A Note on Dynamic Weight Adjusting\nThe model for predicting µ and σ are both simple two-layer neural networks with a shared hidden layer of 100 units, followed by a tanh nonlinearity.\nThe gradient for updating θ by gradient ascent is given by the REINFORCE rule with a baseline: ∇θJ(θ) = Ea∼π [ (Rs,a − bs)∇θ log π(a|s;θ) ] .\n(13)\nwhere Rs,a is the reward for taking action a given input s, whereas bs is a baseline computed by another simple two-layer neural network. In practice, the computation of gradients used in the\nREINFORCE rule (Eq. 13) can be simplified as: ∇θ log π(a|s;θ) = ∇θ − |A|∑ i=1 (ai − µi)2 2σ2i + log σi .\n(14)"

However, the performance of beam search degrades when the model is over-confident about a suboptimal prediction. In this work, we enhance beam search by performing minimum Bayes-risk (MBR) decoding for some extra steps at a later stage. In our experiments, we found that the conventional MBR reranking is only effective with a large beam size. In contrast, later-stage MBR decoding is shown to work regardless of the choice of beam size, and outperform simple MBR reranking. Additionally, we found that the computation of Bayes risks can be much faster by calculating the discrepancies on GPU in batch mode.",
