Subspace clustering algorithms in particular are often applied to problems that fit this description, for example with face images or handwritten digits. While it is straightforward to request human input on these datasets, our goal is to reduce this input as much as possible. We present an algorithm for active query selection that allows us to leverage the union of subspace structure assumed in subspace clustering. The central step of the algorithm is in querying points of minimum margin between estimated subspaces; analogous to classifier margin, these lie near the decision boundary. This procedure can be used after any subspace clustering algorithm that outputs an affinity matrix and is capable of driving the clustering error down more quickly than other state-ofthe-art active query algorithms on datasets with subspace structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on several benchmark datasets, and with a modest number of queries we see significant gains in clustering performance."

      "text" : "The union of subspaces (UoS) model, in which data vectors lie near one of several subspaces, has been used actively in the computer vision community on datasets ranging from images of objects under various lighting conditions [1] to visual surveillance tasks [2]. The recent textbook [3] includes a number of useful applications for this model, including lossy image compression, clustering of face images under different lighting conditions, and video segmentation. Subspace clustering algorithms utilize the UoS model to cluster data vectors and estimate the underlying subspaces. These algorithms achieve excellent clustering performance on datasets such as the extended Yale Face Database B [4], Hopkins 155 [5], and the MNIST handwritten digit database [6]. However, as we will show in Section 4, even oracle UoS classifiers do not achieve perfect clustering on these datasets. While current algorithms for subspace clustering are unsupervised, in many cases a human could provide relevant information in the form of pairwise constraints between points, e.g., answering whether two images are of the same person or whether two digits are the same.\nThe incorporation of pairwise constraints into clustering algorithms is known as pairwise-constrained clustering (PCC). PCC algorithms use supervision in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints by ensuring that points with must-link constraints are clustered together and points with cannot-link constraints are clustered apart. In [7], the authors investigate the phenomenon that incorporating poorly-chosen constraints can lead to an increase in clustering error, rather than a decrease as expected, since points constrained to be in the same cluster that are otherwise dissimilar can confound the constrained clustering algorithm. For this reason, researchers have turned to active query selection methods, in which constraints are intelligently selected based on a number of heuristics. Active methods such as [8] have been shown to significantly reduce clustering error with a modest number of pairwise constraints, and in [9] the authors receive constraints from people with no special training via Amazon Mechanical Turk. These algorithms perform well across a number of datasets but do not take advantage of any known structure in the data. In\nthe case where data lie on a union of subspaces, one would hope that knowledge of the underlying geometry could give hints as to which points are likely to be clustered incorrectly.\nOur contributions are as follows. We introduce a method of active query selection that leverages the known UoS structure to improve pairwise-constrained clustering. We describe two ways to measure the margin of a point in the subspace clustering context using the subspace residual as well as margin based on the affinity matrix. We present a novel PCC algorithm that utilizes the subspace estimates provided by algorithms such as Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) [10] to reduce clustering error as quickly as possible.\nWhile we are certainly not the first to consider actively selecting labels to improve clustering performance, to the best of our knowledge we are the first to do so with structured clusters. Structure within and between data clusters is often leveraged for unsupervised clustering [11], and that structure is also leveraged for adaptive sampling of the structured signals themselves [12, 13, 14]. This paper emphasizes the power of that structure for reducing the number of required labels in an active learning algorithm as opposed to reducing the number of samples of the signal itself, and points to exciting open questions regarding the tradeoff between signal measurements and query requirements in semi-supervised clustering.\nWe show through extensive simulations on real datasets that our algorithm achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art PCC algorithms. We achieve classification rates on ten MNIST digits that are only seen for clustering three digits in state-of-the-art unsupervised algorithms: with a modest number of queries, we get 5% classification error compared to about 30% for unsupervised algorithms and 20% for current PCC algorithms. Further, our algorithm is agnostic to the input subspace clustering algorithm and is therefore trivial to incorporate into existing work on subspace clustering."

      "text" : "A survey of recently developed subspace clustering algorithms can be found in [15] and the textbook [3]. In these and more recent work, clustering algorithms that employ spectral methods achieve the best performance on most datasets. Notable examples of such algorithms include Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) [10], Thresholded Subspace Clustering (TSC) [16], Spectral Local Best-Fit Flats (SLBF) [17], and Greedy Subspace Clustering (GSC) [18]. The core differences between these algorithms lie in the formation of the affinity matrix, after which spectral clustering is performed to obtain label estimates. In SSC, the affinity matrix is formed via a series of ℓ1-penalized regressions. TSC thresholds the spherical distance between points. GSC works by successively (greedily) building subspaces from points likely to lie in the same subspace, and SLBF builds subspaces by leveraging the fact that in high dimensions, nearby points are likely to lie in the same subspace. Of these methods, SSC achieves the best overall performance on benchmark datasets and has the strongest theoretical guarantees, which were introduced in [10] and strengthened in numerous recent works [19, 20, 21, 22]. TSC and GSC also provide theoretical guarantees and, along with SLBF, are significantly less computationally-demanding than SSC. While the development of efficient algorithms with stronger guarantees has received a great deal of attention, very little attention has been paid to the question of what to do about data that cannot be correctly clustered. As we show in Section 4, even oracle PCA classifiers result in some clustering error for common datasets. Thus, when reducing clustering error to zero (or near zero) is a priority, users must look beyond unsupervised subspace clustering algorithms to alternative methods. One such method is to request some supervised input in the form of pairwise constraints, leading to the study of pairwise-constrained clustering (PCC).\nPCC algorithms work by incorporating must-link and cannot-link constraints between points, where points with must-link constraints are forced (or encouraged in the case of noisy labels) to be clustered together, and points with cannot-link constraints are forced to be in separate clusters. In many cases, these constraints can be provided by a human labeler. For example, in [9], the authors perform experiments where comparisons between human faces are provided by users of Amazon Mechanical Turk with an error rate of 1.2%. Similarly, for subspace clustering datasets such as Yale B and MNIST, a human could easily answer questions such as, “Are these two faces the same person?” and “Are these two images the same number?” An early example of PCC is found in [23], where the authors modify the K-means cost function to incorporate such constraints. In [24], the authors utilize active methods to initialize K-means in an intelligent Explore phase, during which neighborhoods of must-linked points are built up. After this phase, new points are queried against representatives from each neighborhood until a must-link is obtained. A\nsimilar explore phase is used in [25], after which a min-max approach is used to select the most uncertain sample. Early work on constrained spectral clustering appears in [26, 27], in which spectral clustering is improved by examining the eigenvectors of the affinity matrix in order to determine the most informative points. However, these methods are limited to the case of two clusters and therefore impractical in many cases.\nMore recently, the authors in [8, 9] improve constrained clustering by modeling which points will be most informative given the current clustering, with state-of-the-art results achieved on numerous datasets by the algorithm in [8] referred to as Uncertainty Reducing Active Spectral Clustering (URASC). URASC works by maintaining a set of certain sets Z = {Z1, . . . , Znc}, whereby points in the same certain set are must-linked and points in different certain sets are cannot-linked. A test point xT is selected via an uncertainty-reduction model motivated by matrix perturbation theory, after which queries are presented in an intelligent manner until xT is either matched with an existing certain set or placed in its own new certain set. In practice [28], the certain sets are initialized using the Explore algorithm of [24].\nWhile URASC and other PCC algorithms described here provide strong performance on general datasets, they do not take into account any knowledge of the underlying geometric structure in the data. To the best of our knowledge, the only such algorithm to do so is that of [29]. The algorithm described in [29] has two major drawbacks. First, the authors use a modified version of the K-subspaces algorithm, which exhibits poor performance on most benchmark datasets (see for example [15]). Second, the algorithm requires expertprovided labels rather than pairwise comparisons. In the case of handwritten digits, it is reasonable to expect that a human could easily provide these labels. However, in the case of face datasets, this requirement becomes extremely impractical. In this work, we extend ideas from PCC to leverage the underlying UoS structure that exists in many known datasets. We follow the framework laid out in [8] and provide an algorithm for improving the performance of subspace clustering that achieves significant benefits over the current state-of-the-art in PCC."

Next, a test point is obtained using either the min-margin criterion for subspaces [29] or a notion of margin based on the affinity matrix, which we define below. In the second step, the test point is queried against representatives from the certain sets until a must-link is found or all certain sets have been queried, in which case the test point becomes its own certain set. Finally, the certain sets are used to impute must-link and cannot-link values in the affinity matrix, and spectral clustering is performed. These steps (excluding the initialization) are then repeated until the maximum number of pairwise comparisons has been obtained. We outline each of these steps below and provide pseudocode in Algorithms 1 and 2. The use of certain sets relies on the assumption that the pairwise queries are answered correctly—an assumption that is common in the literature [24, 25, 8]. However, in [8], the authors demonstrate that an algorithm based on certain sets still yields significant improvements under a small error rate. The study of robustly incorporating noisy pairwise comparisons is an interesting topic for further study."

      "text" : "The concept of margin for subspaces was first studied in [29]. For a subspace Sk with orthogonal projection matrix Pk, let the distance of a point to that subspace be\ndist(x,Sk) = ‖x− Pkx‖2 .\nLet k∗ = arg mink∈[K] dist(x,Sk), where [K] = {1, 2, · · · ,K}. Then the subspace margin of a point x ∈ X is defined as [29]\nµ1(x) = max j 6=k∗,j∈[K]\ndist(x, Sk∗)\ndist(x, Sj) . (1)\nThe point of minimum margin is then defined as arg maxx∈X µ1(x). Note that the fraction is a value in [0, 1], where the larger µ1(x) the closer x is to the decision boundary. A value of 1 implies that the point x is equidistant to its two closest subspaces. In the following theorem, we show that points lying near the intersection of subspaces are included among those of minimum margin with high probability. This method of point selection is then motivated by the fact that the difficult points to cluster are those lying near the intersection of subspaces [12]. Further, theory for SSC ([11],[15]) shows that problematic points are those having large inner product with some or all directions in other subspaces. Subspace margin captures exactly this phenomenon.\nTheorem 1. Consider two d-dimensional subspaces S1 and S2 with corresponding orthogonal projection matrices P1 and P2. Let y = x + n, where x ∈ S1 is such that ‖x− P2x‖\n2 = γ2, and n ∼ N (0, σ2ID). Let µ(y) = ‖y − P1y‖ / ‖y − P2y‖. Then we have\n(1 − ε) √ σ2(D − d)\n(1 + ε) √ σ2(D − d) + γ2 ≤ µ(y) ≤\n(1 + ε) √ σ2(D − d)\n(1 − ε) √ σ2(D − d) + γ2 ,\nwith probability at least 1− 4e−cε 2(D−d), where c is an absolute constant.\nThe proof is given in Appendix A. Note that if ‖y − P1y‖ < ‖y − P2y‖, then µ(y) = µ1(y). In this case, Theorem 1 states that under the given noise model, points with small residual to the incorrect subspace (i.e., points near the intersection of subspaces) will have small margin (large µ1). The statement of Theorem 1 can be used to quantify how near a point must be to the intersection of two subspaces to be considered a point of minimum margin.\nConsider two points y1, y2 with corresponding x1, x2 ∈ S1 and ∥ ∥P⊥2 x1 ∥ ∥ = γ1 and ∥ ∥P⊥2 x2 ∥\n∥ = γ2. Let γ1 < γ2. In the noiseless case, this is enough to guarantee that y1 = x1 lies nearer to S2. Under the given additive noise model (yi = xi + ni for i = 1, 2) the gap between γ1 and γ2 must be larger by some factor depending on the noise level. After two applications of Theorem 1 and rearranging terms, we have that µ(y1) > µ(y2) with high probability if\nβγ22 − γ 2 1 > (1− β)σ 2(D − d). (2)\nwhere β = ((1− ε)/(1 + ε))4, a value near 1 for small ε. Equation (2) shows that the gap γ22 − γ 2 1 must grow (approximately) with the noise level σ2. To get further insight, let φ1 ≤ φ2 ≤ · · · ≤ φd be the d principal angles1 between U1 and U2. If the subspaces are very far apart, 1d ∑d i=1 sin 2(φi) is near 1, and if they are very close 1 d ∑d i=1 sin\n2(φi) is near zero. First we note that, for any x ∈ S1,\nsin2(φ1) ≤ ∥ ∥P⊥2 x ∥ ∥ 2 ≤ sin2(φd) ,\nthat is, there are bounds on ∥ ∥P⊥2 x ∥ ∥ 2 depending on the relationship of the two subspaces. So while we need the gap γ22 − γ 2 1 to be large, the size of this gap is limited by the angles between the subspaces. We also know that if x = U1a for a ∼ N (0, 1 dId), then\nE ∥ ∥P⊥2 x ∥ ∥ 2 =\n1\nd\nd ∑\ni=1\nsin2(φi) .\n1See [32] for a definition of principal angles.\nGiven this, we might imagine that margin is useful in a scenario where sin2(φ1) is small but 1 d ∑d i=1 sin 2(φi) is not, e.g., when the subspaces have intersection but are distant in other directions. With this in mind we state the following corollary.\nCorollary 1. Let s = (\n1 d ∑d i=1 sin 2(φi) ) and for x1 ∈ S1 fix γ 2 1 = sin 2(φ1) + δs for some small δ. For\nx2 ∈ S1, let x2 = U1a where a ∼ N (0, 1 dId). Let the noise scale like σ 2 = α/D and τ > 1 be such that\nτ\n(\nsin2(φ1) + 1\n6 α\n(\nD − d\nD\n))\n≤ 1\nd\nd ∑\ni=1\nsin2(φi) ,\nthat is, the average angle is sufficiently larger than the smallest angle. Then if\nδ < 5\n7 −\n1\nτ\nwe have µ(y1) > µ(y2) with probability at least 1−e −c( 7100 ) 2 ds−4e−c( 1 50 ) 2 (D−d) where c is an absolute constant.\nThe proof is given in Appendix A. From the definition of γ21 = sin 2(φ1) + δs, we see that the size of δ determines how close x1 is to the closest vectors in the two subspaces. Therefore, this corollary shows us that if the two subspaces are close in some directions, and δ is small so that x1 is aligned with those directions, then it will have smaller margin (higher µ) than a point randomly drawn from S1 with high probability."

      "text" : "We now describe in more detail our algorithm for PCC when data lie near a union of subspaces, which we refer to as SUPERPAC (SUbsPace clustERing with Pairwise Active Constraints). The algorithm begins by initializing a set of disjoint certain sets, a process we will describe below. After initializing the certain sets, our algorithm assigns the points most likely to be misclassified to certain sets by presenting a series of pairwise comparisons. Let xT be the test point chosen as the min-margin point using either (1) or (3). For each certain set Zk, the representative xk is chosen as the maximum-margin point within the set. Next, for each k, we let Uk be the d-dimensional PCA estimate of the matrix whose columns are the points {\nx ∈ X : Ĉ(x) = Ĉ(xk) }\n. We then query our test point xT against the representatives xk in order of residual ∥ ∥xT − UkU T k xT ∥ ∥ 2 (smallest first). If a must-link constraint is found, we place xT in the corresponding certain set. Otherwise, we place xT in its own certain set and update the number of certain sets. Finally, we impute values onto the affinity matrix for all points in the certain sets and perform spectral clustering. The process is then repeated until the maximum number of pairwise comparisons has been reached. Pseudocode for the complete algorithm is given in Algorithm 1. As a technical note, we first normalize the input affinity matrix A so that the maximum value is 1. For must-link constraints, we impute a value of 1 in the affinity matrix,\nAlgorithm 1 SUPERPAC\nInput: X = {x1, x2, . . . , xN}: data, K: number of clusters, d: subspace dimension, A: affinity matrix, maxQueries: maximum number of pairwise comparisons Estimate Labels: Ĉ ← SpectralClustering(A,K) Initialize Certain Sets: Initialize Z = {Z1, · · · , Znc} and numQueries via UoS-Explore in Algorithm 2 while numQueries < maxQueries do Obtain Test Point: select xT ← arg maxx∈X µ1(x) or arg maxx∈X µ2(x) Assign xT to Certain Set:\nSort {Z1, · · · , Znc} in order of most likely must-link (according to UoS model), query xT against representatives from Zk until must-link constraint is found or k = nc.

While this does not strictly enforce the constraints, the approach is common in the literature.\nSUPERPAC can be thought of as an extension of ideas from PCC literature [24, 9, 8] to leverage prior knowledge about the underlying geometry of the data. For datasets such as Yale B and MNIST, the strong subspace structure makes Euclidean distance a poor proxy for similarity between points in the same cluster, leading to the superior performance of our algorithm demonstrated in the following sections. Note that this structure does not exist in all datasets, in which case we expect our algorithm to perform worse than current PCC algorithms. The reader will note we made a choice to order the certain sets according to the UoS model; this is similar to the choice in [8] to query according to similarity, where our notion of similarity here is based on subspace distances, rather than some other metric. We found this resulted in significant performance benefits, matching our intuition that points are clustered based on their nearest subspace, rather than the nearest centroid. In contrast to [9, 8], where the test point is chosen according to a global improvement metric, we choose test points according to their classification margin. In our experiments, we found margin (especially subspace margin) to be a strong indicator of which points are misclassified, meaning that our algorithm rapidly corrects the errors that occur as a result of unsupervised subspace clustering. While we only discuss margin as defined by (3) and (1), other criteria for margin are possible. In our experiments, we explored notions of margin based on the ℓ1 regression coefficients from SSC, similar to the Sparsity Concentration Index of [11]. However, we found these notions resulted in decreased performance while incurring a significant computational burden due to the ℓ1 minimization.\nWe now describe the process of initializing the certain sets. Note that this step is not necessary, as we could initialize all certain sets to be empty, but we found it led to improved performance experimentally. A main distinction between subspace clustering and the general clustering problem is that in the UoS model points can lie arbitrarily far from each other but still be on or near the same subspace. For this reason, the Explore algorithm from [24] is unlikely to quickly find points from different clusters in an efficient manner. Here we define an analogous algorithm for the UoS case, termed UoS-Explore, with pseudocode given in Algorithm 2. The goal of UoS-Explore is to find K certain sets, each containing as few points as possible (ideally a single point), allowing us to more rapidly assign test points to certain sets in Algorithm 1. We begin by selecting our test point xT as the most certain point, or the point of maximum margin (minimum µ1 or µ2, depending on the choice of margin), and placing it in its own certain set. We then iteratively select xT as the point of maximum margin that (1) is not in any certain set and (2) has a different cluster estimate from all points in the certain sets. If no such point exists, we choose uniformly at random from all points not in any certain set. This point is queried against a single representative from each certain set according to the UoS model as above until either a must-link is found or all set representatives have been queried, in which case xT is added to a new certain set. This process is repeated until either K certain sets have been created or a terminal number of queries have been used. As points of maximum margin are\nAlgorithm 2 UoS-Explore\nInput: X = {x1, x2, . . . , xN}: data, K: number of subspaces, d: dimension of subspaces, A: affinity matrix, maxQueries: maximum number of pairwise comparisons Estimate Labels: Ĉ ← SpectralClustering(A,K) Calculate Margin: Calculate margin according to (1) or (3) and set x∨ as the point of maximum margin (most confident point) Initialize Certain Sets: Z1 = x∨, Z = {Z1}, numQueries ← 0, nc ← 1 while nc < K and numQueries < maxQueries do Obtain Test Point: Choose xT as point of maximum margin such that Ĉ(xT ) 6= Ĉ(x ∈ Zk) for any k.

We space out the markers for clearer plots. The figure clearly demonstrates the benefits of leveraging UoS structure in constrained clustering. The two SUPERPAC methods perform roughly the same, with residual min-margin as defined in (1) achieving stronger, more stable performance. For K = 2, only 20 pairwise queries are required to surpass the performance of the oracle PCA classifier. For the cases of K = 5 and 7, roughly 2Kd queries are required, and for K = 10 roughly 3Kd queries are required. This demonstrates the significant improvement over the results in [29], where 3Kd labels are required to surpass oracle performance; providing oracle labels (in this case, stating who a person is) requires far more expertise than pairwise comparisons (answering whether two images are of the same person). Note that URASC appears flat for K = 2 and appears to have worse performance as the number of queries increases for higher values of K. This is due to the previously mentioned fact that imputing the wrong constraints can lead to worse (or in this case, the same) clustering performance. We show below that for sufficiently many queries, the error decreases as expected.\nNext, we show the effectiveness of the UoS-Explore algorithm over Explore used in [24, 8]. We run the algorithms on 100 random subsets of K faces and report the average number of queries required to obtain K certain sets in Table 1. The table shows that UoS-Explore uses far fewer queries to obtain K unique certain sets, with residual-based margin using very near the minimum required K(K − 1)/2 queries. Affinity-based margin has smaller gains due to the fact that the margin itself ignores the underlying subspace structure. Note that in SUPERPAC and URASC, the query budget for this initialization step is limited in practice, and hence our method is more likely to discover K disjoint certain sets.\nWe also compare the query selection methods in terms of computational times on this dataset. Table 2 shows the average time per query for each of the three query selection methods along with the maximum deviation. Random querying can be selected offline and requires negligible computational time. Of the active methods, URASC is the most computationally efficient. The SUPERPAC methods require more time due to the necessity of computing the singular value decomposition to obtain a test point (for SUPERPAC-R) and to order the certain sets (for both methods). However, the required computational times are not prohibitive, especially given the resulting gains in clustering performance and the fact that the delay of querying the user will dominate. Improving the computational complexity of our algorithm is a topic for our future research."

We follow a similar\nmethodology to the previous section and select 100 random subsets of size K, using subspace dimension d = 3 as in [16]. To demonstrate that our algorithm is agnostic to the input clustering method, we use TSC [16] to obtain the input affinity matrix. We use Nk = 100 points in each subspace, the regime in which TSC has been shown to outperform SSC on this dataset [16]. Fig. 2 shows the misclassification rate versus number of pairwise constraints for K = 2, 5, 7, and 10 digits. The figure again demonstrates the effectiveness of utilizing UoS structure when it exists. Although not pictured, we found in our experiments that [29] again requires as many labels as SUPERPAC requires pairwise comparisons. In the case of MNIST digits, labels are relatively easy to obtain, and we expect that incorporating full labels into our algorithm would result in performance benefits.\nFig. 3 shows the misclassification error for both the Yale B and MNIST datasets for a large number of pairwise comparisons. We see for both datasets that URASC does outperform random constraints but requires many more queries than our algorithm.\nTo demonstrate the flexibility of our algorithm, we run SUPERPAC-R starting with the output affinity matrix from SSC, TSC, and GSC. Fig. 4 shows the resulting misclassification rates for Yale B with K = 5 and 10 and MNIST with K = 5 and 10. In all three cases, the error decreases rapidly and significantly outperforms URASC. During the preparation of this manuscript, we became aware of [35, 36, 37], where more scalable algorithms for subspace clustering have been developed. We also ran SUPERPAC using the output of Elastic Net Subspace Clustering on the Coil-100 dataset. SUPERPAC continues to outperform URASC and drives the error from 30% to 1% after roughly 5000 comparisons. Further comparisons on large datasets are part of our ongoing work."

These points have been shown to lie in a union of affine subspaces of dimension at most 3 [38]. The 155 sequences contain K = 2 and 3 motions depending on the sequence. We compare the performance as the number of pairwise comparisons is increased with the input affinity matrix obtained by SSC. The results are shown in Fig. 5. With this dataset, where the subspaces are affine and so the centers may not be close together, we see that the URASC algorithm does as well as SUPERPAC, despite not leveraging the subspace structure. Modifying SUPERPAC to account for the affine structure is a topic for our future research."

      "text" : "We briefly examine the importance of the methods of selecting test points and demonstrate that in the case of URASC, the algorithm framework of placing test points in certain sets is what provides the main benefit. In the following figures, we compare SUPERPAC, URASC, and random queries with “Active Random” querying. Active Random querying works by following the same framework as URASC, comparing to points already within certain sets, but chooses test points at random and queries against certain sets at random. We also remove the Explore step at initialization. In contrast to purely random label requests, Active Random makes use of all available query information, providing a more realistic benchmark for active PCC algorithms.\nWe first compare the performance of URASC and both random algorithms on the Sonar, Balance, and Leaf-250 datasets, all of which are used in [8] as benchmarks. We do not compare with SUPERPAC on the Leaf dataset as only the affinity matrix is publicly accessible [39], though we do not expect any performance\nbenefits over URASC. Fig. 6 shows the average clustering error over 10 trials as a function of pairwise comparisons for these datasets, using d = 1 for SUPERPAC. We see that all algorithms following the certain set framework achieve roughly the same performance when the number of clusters is low, demonstrating that it is the active framework wherein we compare against points in certain sets that provides the most benefit in this case. For the Leaf dataset, we have K = 25 clusters, which makes querying the test point against representatives from each certain set very inefficient.\nFinally, we compare the performance of SUPERPAC, URASC, and the two random algorithms on the Yale B and MNIST datasets for 100 random subsets of K = 5 and K = 10 subjects, with the results shown in Fig. 7. Here we see again that URASC provides only very modest benefits over the Active Random algorithm, whereas choosing points by subspace margin results in a significant performance increase."

      "heading" : "5 Conclusion",
      "text" : "We have presented a method of selecting and incorporating pairwise constraints into subspace clustering that considers the underlying geometric structure of the problem. The union of subspaces model is often used in computer vision applications where it is possible to request input from human labelers in the form of pairwise constraints. We showed that labeling is often necessary for subspace classifiers to achieve a clustering error near zero, as even an oracle PCA approach does not allow perfect clustering; additionally, these constraints improve the clustering procedure overall and allow for perfect clustering with a modest number of requests for human input.\nWe see this work as a bridge between adaptive query selection for pairwise constrained clustering and adaptive sampling for structured signals (e.g., see previous work on sparse [12, 13], structured sparse [14], and low rank signals [40]). Several works apply ideas of compressive sensing to clustering [41, 42] and\nclassification [11, 43], and recent work in subspace clustering has also shown that it’s possible to cluster columns that lie in a union of subspaces even using compressed or subsampled data [44, 45, 46, 47]. A key interesting open question is whether the number of active queries required for clustering increases as the compression of the data increases. To address this we first plan to develop techniques for handling noisy query responses. In the case of face images, one may assume that compressed data would be harder to distinguish, leading to noisier query responses.\nFinally, we saw that for datasets with different types of cluster structure, the structure assumptions of each algorithm had direct impact on performance; in the future we plan to additionally develop techniques for learning from unlabeled data whether the union of subspace model or a standard clustering approach is more appropriate."

Further, by Exercise 5.2.5 of [48], we can replace E ‖X‖2 by (\nE ‖X‖22\n)1/2\nin the concentration inequality. Applying Thm. 2 to the above, we see that\nPr {∣ ∣\n∣\n∥ ∥P⊥1 y ∥ ∥− √\nσ2(D − d) ∣ ∣ ∣ ≥ t } ≤ 2 exp\n(\n− ct2\nσ2\n)\n.

Applying Thm. 2 to the centered random vector ȳ ∼ N (0, σ2P⊥2 ) with Lipschitz function h = f ◦ g, we have that\nPr {∣ ∣\n∣\n∥ ∥P⊥2 y ∥ ∥− √\nσ2(D − d) + γ2 ∣ ∣ ∣ ≥ t } ≤ 2 exp\n(\n− ct2\nσ2\n)\n.

      "heading" : "B Proof of Corollary 1",
      "text" : "We make some remarks first to connect our results to other subspace distances that are often used. Perhaps the most intuitive form of subspace distance between that spanned by U1 and U2 is 1 d‖(I−U1U1)\nTU2‖2F ; if the two subspaces are the same, the projection onto the orthogonal complement is zero; if they are orthogonal, we get the norm of U2 alone, giving a distance of 1. This is equal to the more visually symmetric 1− 1 d‖U T 1 U2‖ 2 F , another common distance. Further we note that, by the definition of principal angles [32],\n1− 1\nd ‖UT1 U2‖ 2 F = 1−\n1\nd\nd ∑\ni=1\ncos2(φi) = 1\nd\nd ∑\ni=1\nsin2(φi) .\nProof. We have from Theorem 1 that\nµ(y2) ≤ (1 + ε)\n√\nσ2(D − d)\n(1− ε) √ σ2(D − d) + γ22 and\n(1− ε) √ σ2(D − d)\n(1 + ε) √ σ2(D − d) + γ21 ≤ µ(y1)\nwith probability at least 1 − 4e−cε 2(D−d). Therefore if we get the upper bound of µ(y2) to be smaller than the lower bound of µ(y1), we are done, as we described above in Equation (2). Rearranging this desired inequality we see that we need\nγ21 < β 4γ22 − (1− β 4)σ2(D − d). (6)\nwhere β = (1− ε)/(1 + ε). Let ε be such that β4 = 5/6, and let γ21 = sin 2(φ1) + δs as in the theorem. Then we wish to select δ to satisfy\nδ < 5 6γ 2 2 − sin 2(φ1)− 1 6σ 2(D − d)\ns . (7)\nApplying concentration with γ22 , we have that γ 2 2 ≥ (1− ξ) 2s with probability at least 1− e−cξ 2ds where c is an absolute constant. Therefore taking ξ to be such that (1− ξ)2 = 6/7, we require\nδ < 5 7s− sin 2(φ1)− 1 6σ 2(D − d)\ns =\n5 7 − 1 τ\nwhere we used the definition of τ in the theorem. To quantify the probability we need the appropriate values for ε and ξ; we lower bound both with simple fractions: 1/50 < ε where ((1− ε)/(1 + ε))4 = β = 5/6 and 7/100 < ξ where (1 − ξ)2 = 6/7. Applying the union bound with the chosen concentration values implies that µ(y1) > µ(y2) holds with probability at least 1− e −c( 7100 ) 2 ds − 4e−c( 1 50 ) 2 (D−d)."

Subspace clustering algorithms in particular are often applied to problems that fit this description, for example with face images or handwritten digits. While it is straightforward to request human input on these datasets, our goal is to reduce this input as much as possible. We present an algorithm for active query selection that allows us to leverage the union of subspace structure assumed in subspace clustering. The central step of the algorithm is in querying points of minimum margin between estimated subspaces; analogous to classifier margin, these lie near the decision boundary. This procedure can be used after any subspace clustering algorithm that outputs an affinity matrix and is capable of driving the clustering error down more quickly than other state-ofthe-art active query algorithms on datasets with subspace structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on several benchmark datasets, and with a modest number of queries we see significant gains in clustering performance.",
