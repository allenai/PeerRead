For normal modal logi s, fusions have been investigated in detail. In parti ular, it is known that, under ertain onditions, de-\nidability transfers from the omponent logi s to their fusion. Though des ription logi s are losely related to modal logi s, they are not ne essarily normal. In addition, ABox reasoning in des ription logi s is not overed by the results from modal logi s.\nIn this paper, we extend the de idability transfer results from normal modal logi s to a large lass of des ription logi s. To over di erent des ription logi s in a uniform way, we introdu e abstra t des ription systems, whi h an be seen as a ommon generalization of des ription and modal logi s, and show the transfer results in this general setting.\n1. Introdu tion\nKnowledge representation systems based on des ription logi s (DL) an be used to represent the knowledge of an appli ation domain in a stru tured and formally well-understood way (Bra hman & S hmolze, 1985; Baader & Hollunder, 1991; Bra hman, M Guinness, Patel-S hneider, Alperin Resni k, & Borgida, 1991; Woods & S hmolze, 1992; Borgida, 1995; Horro ks, 1998). In su h systems, the important notions of the domain an be des ribed by on ept des riptions, i.e., expressions that are built from atomi on epts (unary predi ates) and atomi roles (binary predi ates) using the on ept onstru tors provided by the des ription logi employed by the system. The atomi on epts and the on ept des riptions represent sets of individuals, whereas roles represent binary relations between individuals. For example, using the atomi on epts Woman and Human, and the atomi role hild, the on ept of all women having only daughters (i.e., women su h that all their\nhildren are again women) an be represented by the des ription Woman u 8 hild:Woman, and the on ept of all mothers by the des ription Womanu9 hild:Human. In this example, we have used the onstru tors on ept onjun tion (u), value restri tion (8R:C), and existential restri tion (9R:C). In the DL literature, also various other onstru tors have been\nonsidered. A prominent example are so- alled number restri tions, whi h are available in almost all DL systems. For example, using number restri tions the on ept of all women\n2002 AI A ess Foundation and Morgan Kaufmann Publishers. All rights reserved.\nhaving exa tly two hildren an be represented by the on ept des ription\nWoman u ( 2 hild) u ( 2 hild):\nThe knowledge base of a DL system onsists of a terminologi al omponent (TBox) and an assertional omponent (ABox). In its simplest form, the TBox onsists of on ept de nitions, whi h assign names (abbreviations) to omplex des riptions. More general TBox formalisms allow for so- alled general on ept in lusion axioms (GCIs) between omplex des riptions. For example, the on ept in lusion\nHuman u ( 3 hild) v 9entitled:Taxbreak\nstates that people having at least three hildren are entitled to a tax break. The ABox formalism onsists of on ept assertions (stating that an individual belongs to a on ept) and role assertions (stating that two individuals are related by a role). For example, the assertions Woman(MARY); hild(MARY;TOM);Human(TOM) state that Mary is a woman, who has a hild, Tom, who is a human.\nDL systems provide their users with various inferen e apabilities that allow them to dedu e impli it knowledge from the expli itly represented knowledge. For instan e, the subsumption problem is on erned with sub on ept-super on ept relationships: C is subsumed by D (C v D) if, and only if, all instan es of C are also instan es of D, i.e., the rst des ription is always interpreted as a subset of the se ond des ription. For example, the on ept des ription Woman obviously subsumes the on ept des ription Woman u 8 hild:Woman. The on ept des ription C is satis able i it is non- ontradi tory, i.e., it an be interpreted by a nonempty set. In DLs allowing for onjun tion and negation of on epts, subsumption an be redu ed to (un)satis ability: C v D i C u :D is unsatis able. The instan e\nhe king problem onsists of de iding whether a given individual is an instan e of a given on ept. For example, w.r.t. the assertions from above, MARY is an instan e of the on ept des ription Woman u 9 hild:Human. The ABox A is onsistent i it is non- ontradi tory, i.e., it has a model. In DLs allowing for negation of on epts, the instan e problem an be redu ed to (in) onsisten y of ABoxes: i is an instan e of C w.r.t. the ABox A i A[f:C(i)g is in onsistent.\nIn order to ensure a reasonable and predi table behavior of a DL system, reasoning in the DL employed by the system should at least be de idable, and preferably of low\nomplexity. Consequently, the expressive power of the DL in question must be restri ted in an appropriate way. If the imposed restri tions are too severe, however, then the important notions of the appli ation domain an no longer be expressed. Investigating this trade-o between the expressivity of DLs and the omplexity of their inferen e problems has thus been one of the most important issues in DL resear h (see, e.g., Levesque & Bra hman, 1987; Nebel, 1988; S hmidt-S hau , 1989; S hmidt-S hau & Smolka, 1991; Nebel, 1990; Donini, Lenzerini, Nardi, & Nutt, 1991, 1997; Donini, Hollunder, Lenzerini, Spa amela, Nardi, & Nutt, 1992; S haerf, 1993; Donini, Lenzerini, Nardi, & S haerf, 1994; De Gia omo & Lenzerini, 1994a, 1994b, 1995; Calvanese, De Gia omo, & Lenzerini, 1999; Lutz, 1999; Horro ks, Sattler, & Tobies, 2000).\nThis paper investigates an approa h for extending the expressivity of DLs that (in many ases) guarantees that reasoning remains de idable: the fusion of DLs. In order to explain\nthe di eren e between the usual union and the fusion of DLs, let us onsider a simple example. Assume that the DL D\n1\nis ALC, i.e., it provides for the Boolean operators u, t,\n: and the additional on ept onstru tors value restri tion 8R:C and existential restri tion 9R:C, and that the DL D\n2\nprovides for the Boolean operators and number restri tions\n( nR) and ( nR). If an appli ation requires on ept onstru tors from both DLs for expressing its relevant on epts, then one would usually onsider the union D\n1\n[ D\n2\nof D\n1\nand D\n2\n, whi h allows for the unrestri ted use of all onstru tors. For example, the on ept\ndes ription C\n1\n:= (9R:A)u (9R::A)u ( 1R) is a legal D\n1\n[D\n2\ndes ription. Note that this\ndes ription is unsatis able, due to the intera tion between onstru tors of D\n1\nand D\n2\n. The\nfusion D\n1\nD\n2\nof D\n1\nand D\n2\nprevents su h intera tions by imposing the following restri tion:\none assumes that the set of all role names is partitioned into two sets, one that an be used in onstru tors of D\n1\n, and another one that an be used in onstru tors of D\n2\n. Thus, the\ndes ription C\n1\nfrom above is not a legal D\n1\nD\n2\ndes ription sin e it uses the same role R\nboth in the existential restri tions (whi h are D\n1\n- onstru tors) and in the number restri tion\n(whi h is a D\n2\n- onstru tor). In ontrast, the des riptions (9R\n1\n:A) u (9R\n1\n::A) u ( 1R\n2\n)\nand (9R\n1\n:( 1R\n2\n)) are admissible in D\n1\nD\n2\nsin e they employ di erent roles in the D\n1\n-\nand D\n2\n- onstru tors. If the on epts that must be expressed are su h that they require\nboth onstru tors from D\n1\nand D\n2\n, but the ones from D\n1\nfor other roles than the ones from\nD\n2\n, then one does not really need the union of D\n1\nand D\n2\n; the fusion would be suÆ ient.\nWhat is the advantage of taking the fusion instead of the union? Basi ally, for the union of two DLs one must design new reasoning methods, whereas reasoning in the fusion an be redu ed to reasoning in the omponent DLs. Indeed, reasoning in the union may even be unde idable whereas reasoning in the fusion is still de idable. As an example, we onsider the DLs (i) ALCF , whi h extends the basi DL ALC by fun tional roles (features) and the same-as onstru tor (agreement) on hains of fun tional roles (Hollunder & Nutt, 1990; Baader, B ur kert, Nebel, Nutt, & Smolka, 1993); and (ii) ALC +;Æ;t , whi h extends ALC by transitive losure, omposition, and union of roles (Baader, 1991; S hild, 1991). For both DLs, subsumption of on ept des riptions is known to be de idable (Hollunder & Nutt, 1990; S hild, 1991; Baader, 1991). However, their union ALCF +;Æ;t has an unde idable subsumption problem (Baader et al., 1993). This unde idability result depends on the fa t that, in ALCF +;Æ;t , the role onstru tors transitive losure, omposition, and union an be applied to fun tional roles that also appear within the same-as onstru tor. This is not allowed in the fusion ALCF ALC +;Æ;t . Of ourse, failure of a ertain unde idability proof does not make the fusion de idable.\nWhy do we know that the fusion of de idable DLs is again de idable? A tually, in general we don't, and this was our main reason for writing this paper. The notion \\fusion\" was introdu ed and investigated in modal logi , basi ally to transfer results like nite axiomatizability, de idability, nite model property, et . from uni-modal logi s (with one pair of box and diamond operators) to multi-modal logi s (with several su h pairs, possibly satisfying di erent axioms). This has led to rather general transfer results (see, e.g., Wolter, 1998; Kra ht & Wolter, 1991; Fine & S hurz, 1996; Spaan, 1993; Gabbay, 1999 for results that on ern de idability), whi h are sometimes restri ted to so- alled normal modal logi s (Chellas, 1980). Sin e there is a lose relationship between modal logi s and DLs (S hild, 1991), it is lear that these transfer results also apply to some DLs. The question is, however, to whi h DLs exa tly and to whi h inferen e problems. First, some DLs\nallow for onstru tors that are not onsidered in modal logi s (e.g., the same-as onstru tor mentioned above). Se ond, some DL onstru tors that have been onsidered in modal logi s, su h as quali ed number restri tions ( nR:C), ( nR:C) (Hollunder & Baader, 1991), whi h orrespond to graded modalities (Van der Hoek & de Rijke, 1995), an easily be shown to be non-normal. Third, the transfer results for de idability are on erned with the satis ability problem (with or without general in lusion axioms). ABoxes and the related inferen e problems are not onsidered. ABoxes an be simulated in modal logi s allowing for so- alled nominals, i.e., names for individuals, within formulae (Prior, 1967; Gargov & Goranko, 1993; Are es, Bla kburn, & Marx, 2000). However, as we will see below, the general transfer results do not apply to modal logi s with nominals.\nThe purpose of this paper is to larify for whi h DLs de idability of the omponent DLs transfers to their fusion. To this purpose, we introdu e so- alled abstra t des ription systems (ADSs), whi h an be seen as a ommon generalization of des ription and modal logi s. We de ne the fusion of ADSs, and state four theorems that say under whi h onditions de idability transfers from the omponent ADSs to their fusion. Two of these theorems are on erned with inferen e w.r.t. general on ept in lusion axioms and two with inferen e without TBox axioms. In both ases, we rst formulate and prove the results for the\nonsisten y problem of ABoxes (more pre isely, the orresponding problem for ADSs) and\nthen establish analogous results for the satis ability problem of on epts.\nFrom the DL point of view, the four theorems shown in this paper are on erned with\nthe following four de ision problems:\n(i) de idability of onsisten y of ABoxes w.r.t. TBox axioms (Theorem 17);\n(ii) de idability of satis ability of on epts w.r.t. TBox axioms; (Corollary 22);\n(iii) de idability of onsisten y of ABoxes without TBox axioms (Theorem 29); and\n(iv) de idability of satis ability of on epts without TBox axioms (Corollary 34).\nThese theorems imply that de idability of the onsisten y problem and the satis ability problem transfers to the fusion for most DLs onsidered in the literature. The main ex eptions (whi h do not satisfy the prerequisites of the theorems) are\n(a) DLs that are not propositionally losed, i.e., do not ontain all Boolean onne tives;\n(b) DLs allowing for individuals ( alled nominals in modal logi ) in on ept des riptions;\nand\n( ) DLs expli itly allowing for the universal role or for negation of roles.\nResults from modal logi for problem (iv) usually require the omponent modal logi s to be normal. Our Theorem 29 is less restri tive, and thus also applies to DLs allowing for\nonstru tors like quali ed number restri tions.\n2. Des ription logi s\nBefore de ning abstra t des ription systems in the next se tion, we introdu e the main features of DLs that must be overed by this de nition. To this purpose, we rst introdu e\nALC, the basi DL ontaining all Boolean onne tives, and the relevant inferen e problems. Then, we onsider di erent possibilities for extending ALC to more expressive DLs.\nDe nition 1 (ALC Syntax). Let N\nC\n, N\nR\n, and N\nI\nbe ountable and pairwise disjoint sets\nof on ept, role, and individual names, respe tively. The set of ALC on ept des riptions is the smallest set su h that\n1. every on ept name is a on ept des ription,\n2. if C and D are on ept des riptions and R is a role name, then the following expres-\nsions are also on ept des riptions:\n:C (negation), C uD ( onjun tion), C tD (disjun tion),\n9R:C (existential restri tion), and 8R:C (value restri tion).\nWe use > as an abbreviation of A t :A and ? as an abbreviation for A u :A (where A is an arbitrary on ept name).\nLet C and D be on ept des riptions. Then C v D is a general on ept in lusion axiom\n(GCI). A nite set of su h axioms is alled a TBox.\nLet C be a on ept des ription, R a role name, and i; j individual names. Then C(i) is a on ept assertion and R(i; j) a role assertion. A nite set of su h assertions is alled an ABox.\nThe meaning of ALC- on ept des riptions, TBoxes, and ABoxes an be de ned with\nthe help of a set-theoreti semanti s.\nDe nition 2 (ALC Semanti s). An ALC-interpretation I is a pair (\nI\n;\nI\n), where\nI\nis a nonempty set, the domain of the interpretation, and\nI\nis the interpretation fun tion.\nThe interpretation fun tion maps\nea h on ept name A to a subset A\nI\nof\nI\n,\nea h role name R to a subset R\nI\nof\nI\nI\n,\nea h individual name i to an element i\nI\nof\nI\nsu h that di erent names are mapped\nto di erent elements (unique name assumption).\nFor a role name R and an element a 2\nI\nwe de ne R\nI\n(a) := fb j (a; b) 2 R\nI\ng. The\ninterpretation fun tion an indu tively be extended to omplex on epts as follows:\n(:C)\nI\n:=\nI\nn C\nI\n(C uD)\nI\n:= C\nI\n\\D\nI\n(C tD)\nI\n:= C\nI\n[D\nI\n(9R:C)\nI\n:= fa 2\nI\nj R\nI\n(a) \\ C\nI\n6= ;g\n(8R:C)\nI\n:= fa 2\nI\nj R\nI\n(a) C\nI\ng\nAn interpretation I is a model of the TBox T i it satis es C\nI\nD\nI\nfor all GCIs C v D\nin T . It is a model of the ABox A i it satis es i\nI\n2 C\nI\nfor all on ept assertions C(i) 2 A\nand (i\nI\n; j\nI\n) 2 R\nI\nfor all role assertions R(i; j) 2 A. Finally, I is a model of an ABox\nrelative to a TBox i it is a model of both the ABox and the TBox.\nGiven this semanti s, we an now formally de ne the relevant inferen e problems.\nDe nition 3 (Inferen es). Let C and D be on ept des riptions, i an individual name, T a TBox, and A an ABox. We say that C subsumes D relative to the TBox T (D v\nT\nC)\ni D\nI\nC\nI\nfor all models I of T . The on ept des ription C is satis able relative to the\nTBox T i there exists a model I of T su h that C\nI\n6= ;. The individual i is an instan e of\nC in the ABox A relative to the TBox T i i\nI\n2 C\nI\nfor all models of A relative to T . The\nABox A is onsistent relative to the TBox T i there exists a model of A relative to T .\nThese three inferen es an also be onsidered without referen e to a TBox: C subsumes D (C is satis able) i C subsumes D (C is satis able) relative to the empty TBox, and i is an instan e of C in A (A is onsistent) i i is an instan e of C in A (A is onsistent) relative to the empty TBox.\nWe restri t our attention to DLs that are propositionally losed (i.e., allow for the Boolean operators onjun tion, disjun tion, and negation). Consequently, subsumption\nan be redu ed to (un)satis ability sin e C v\nT\nD i C u :D is unsatis able relative to T .\nConversely, (un)satis ability an be redu ed to subsumption sin e C is unsatis able relative to T i C v\nT\n?. For this reason, it is irrelevant whether we onsider the subsumption or the\nsatis ability problem in our results on erning the transfer of de idability of these problems from omponent DLs to their fusion (informally alled transfer results in the following).\nSimilarly, the instan e problem an be redu ed to the (in) onsisten y problem and vi e versa: i is an instan e of C in A relative to T i A[ f:C(i)g is in onsistent relative to T ; and A is in onsistent relative to T i i is an instan e of ? in A relative to T , where i is an arbitrary individual name. Consequently, it is irrelevant whether we onsider the instan e problem or the onsisten y problem in our transfer results.\nFinally, the satis ability problem an be redu ed to the onsisten y problem: C is satis able relative to T i the ABox fC(i)g is onsistent relative to T , where i is an arbitrary individual name. However, the onverse need not be true. It should be obvious that this implies that a transfer result for the satis ability problem does not yield the orresponding transfer result for the onsisten y problem: from de idability of the onsisten y problem for the omponent DLs we an only dedu e de idability of the satis ability problem in their fusion. What might be less obvious is that a transfer result for the onsisten y problem need not imply the orresponding transfer result for the satis ability problem: if the satis ability problems in the omponent DLs are de idable, then the transfer result for the onsisten y problem an just not be applied (sin e the prerequisite of this transfer result, namely, de idability of the onsisten y problem in the omponent DLs, need not be satis ed). However, we will show that the method used to show the transfer result for the onsisten y problem also applies to the satis ability problem.\n2.1 More expressive DLs\nThere are several possibilities for extending ALC in order to obtain a more expressive DL. The three most prominent are adding additional on ept onstru tors, adding role onstru - tors, and formulating restri tions on role interpretations. In addition to giving examples for su h extensions, we also introdu e a naming s heme for the obtained DLs. Additional\non ept onstru tors are indi ated by appending aligraphi letters to the language name, role onstru tors by symbols in supers ript, and restri tions on roles by letters in subs ript.\nWe start with introdu ing restri tions on role interpretations, sin e we need to refer to\nsu h restri tions when de ning ertain on ept onstru tors.\n2.1.1 Restri tions on role interpretations\nThese restri tions enfor e the interpretations of roles to satisfy ertain properties, su h as fun tionality, transitivity, et . We onsider three prominent examples:\n1. Fun tional roles. Here one onsiders a subset N\nF\nof the set of role names N\nR\n,\nwhose elements are alled features. An interpretation must map features f 2 N\nF\nto\nfun tional binary relations f\nI\nI\nI\n, i.e., relations satisfying 8a; b; :f\nI\n(a; b) ^\nf\nI\n(a; ) ! b = . We will sometimes treat fun tional relations as partial fun tions,\nand write f\nI\n(a) = b rather than f\nI\n(a; b). ALC extended with features is denoted by\nALC\nf\n.\n2. Transitive roles. Here one onsiders a subset N\nR\n+ of N\nR\n. Role names R 2 N\nR\n+\nare alled transitive roles. An interpretation must map transitive roles R 2 N\nR\n+ to\ntransitive binary relations R\nI\nI\nI\n. ALC extended with transitive roles is\ndenoted by ALC\nR\n+ .\n3. Role hierar hies. A role in lusion axiom is an expression of the form R v S with\nR;S 2 N\nR\n. A nite set H of role in lusion axioms is alled a role hierar hy. An\ninterpretation must satisfy R\nI\nS\nI\nfor all R v S 2 H. ALC extended with a role\nhierar hy H is denoted by ALC\nH(H)\n. If H is lear from the ontext or irrelevant, we\nwrite ALC\nH\ninstead of ALC\nH(H)\n.\nThe above restri tions an also be ombined with ea h other. For example, ALC\nHR\n+ is ALC\nwith a role hierar hy and transitive roles.\nTransitive roles in DLs were rst investigated by Sattler (1996). Features were introdu ed in DLs by Hollunder and Nutt (1990) and (under the name \\attributes\") in the CLASSIC system (Bra hman et al., 1991), in both ases in onjun tion with feature agreements and disagreements (see on ept onstru tors below). Features without agreements and disagreements are, e.g., used in the DL SHIF (Horro ks & Sattler, 1999), albeit in a more expressive \\lo al\" way, where fun tionality an be asserted to hold at ertain individuals, but not ne essarily on the whole model. A ording to our naming s heme, we indi ate the presen e of features in a DL by the letter f in subs ript. 1\nA remark on role hierar hies is also in order: in our de nition, if H\n1\nand H\n2\nare di erent\nrole hierar hies, then ALC\nH(H\n1\n)\nand ALC\nH(H\n2\n)\nare di erent DLs. In the DL literature,\nusually only one logi ALC\nH\nis de ned and role hierar hies are treated like TBoxes, i.e.,\nsatis ability and subsumption are de ned relative to TBoxes and role hierar hies (see, e.g., Horro ks, 1998). For our purposes, however, it is more onvenient to de ne one DL per role hierar hy sin e distin t role hierar hies impose distin t restri tions on the interpretation of roles. The advantages of this approa h will be ome lear later on when frames and abstra t des ription systems are introdu ed.\n1. Note that some authors (e.g., Horro ks & Sattler, 1999) use an appended F to denote lo al features.\nFollowing Hollunder and Nutt (1990), we will use F to denote a DL that allows for feature agreements (see below).\n2.1.2 Con ept onstru tors\nCon ept onstru tors take on ept and/or role des riptions and transform them into more\nomplex on ept des riptions. In addition to the onstru tors available in ALC, various other on ept onstru tors are onsidered in the DL literature. A small olle tion of su h\nonstru tors an be found in Figure 1, where jSj denotes the ardinality of a set S. The symbols in the rightmost olumn indi ate the naming s heme for the resulting DL. As mentioned above the name modi ers for on ept onstru tors are not written in subs ript, they are appended to the language name. For example, ALC\nHR\n+ extended with quali ed\nnumber restri tions is alled ALCQ\nHR\n+ . The syntax of the extended DLs is as expe ted, i.e.,\nthe onstru tors may be arbitrarily ombined. The semanti s is obtained by augmenting the semanti s of ALC with the appropriate onditions, whi h an be found in the third\nolumn in Figure 1. Nominals and feature (dis)agreements need some more explanation:\nNominals. We onsider a set N\nO\nof (names for) nominals, whi h is pairwise disjoint\nto the sets N\nC\n, N\nR\n, and N\nI\n. Elements from N\nO\nare often denoted by I (possibly\nwith index). An interpretation must map nominals to singleton subsets of\nI\n. The\nintention underlying nominals is that they stand for elements of , just like individual names. However, sin e we want to use the nominal I 2 N\nO\nas a (nullary) on ept\nonstru tor, I must interpret them by a set, namely the singleton set onsisting of\nthe individual that I denotes.\nFeature (dis)agreements. ALCF is the extension of ALC\nf\nwith feature agreements\nand disagreements. Beside the additional on ept onstru tors, ALCF uses feature\nhains as part of the (dis)agreement onstru tor. A feature hain is an expression of\nthe form u = f\n1\nÆ Æ f\nn\n. The interpretation u\nI\nof su h a feature hain is just the\nomposition of the partial fun tions f\nI 1 ; : : : ; f I n , where omposition is to be read from\nleft to right.\nDLs in luding nominals or feature (dis)agreements and additional on ept onstru tors or restri tions on role interpretations are de ned (and named) in the obvious way.\nNumber restri tion are available in almost all DL systems. The DL ALCN (i.e., ALC extended with number restri tions) was rst treated by Hollunder and Nutt (1990), as was ALCF . The DL ALCQ was rst investigated by Hollunder and Baader (1991), and ALCO by S haerf (1994).\nFor a binary relation R, R\ndenotes the transitive losure of R.\n2.1.3 Role onstru tors\nRole onstru tors allow us to build omplex role des riptions. A olle tion of role onstru - tors an be found in Figure 2. Again, the rightmost olumn indi ates the naming s heme, where name modi ers for role onstru tors are written in supers ript and separated by\nommas. For example, ALCQ with inverse roles and transitive losure is alled ALCQ\n+; 1\n.\nIn DLs admitting role onstru tors, the set of role des riptions is de ned indu tively, analogously to the set of on ept des riptions. The semanti s of role onstru tors is given in the third olumn of Figure 2. As with on ept des riptions, it an be used to extend the interpretation fun tion from role names to role des riptions.\nIn a DL with role onstru tors, role des riptions an be used wherever role names may\nbe used in the orresponding DLs without role onstru tors. For example,\n9(R\n1\nuR\n3\n):C u 8(R\n2\ntR\n2\n)::C\nis an ALC\n;u;t\n- on ept des ription. This on ept des ription is unsatis able sin e R\n2\nt R\n2\nis equivalent to the universal role. Note that role des riptions an also be used within role assertions in an ABox.\nThe DL ALC\nÆ;t;+\nwas rst treated by Baader (1991) (under the name ALC\ntrans\n); S hild\n(1991) has shown that this DL is a notational variant of propositional dynami logi (PDL). DLs with Boolean operators on roles were investigated by Lutz and Sattler (2000). The inverse operator was available in the system CRACK (Bres iani, Fran oni, & Tessaris, 1995), and reasoning in DLs with inverse roles was, for example, investigated by Calvanese et al. (1998) and Horro ks et al. (2000). The universal role an be expressed using DLs with Boolean operators on roles (see the above example), and it an in turn be used to simulate general on ept in lusion axioms within on ept des riptions.\n2.2 Restri ting the syntax\nUntil now, onstru tors ould be ombined arbitrarily. Sometimes it makes sense to restri t the intera tion between onstru tors sin e reasoning in the restri ted DL may be easier than reasoning in the unrestri ted DL. We will onsider DLs imposing ertain restri tions on\n1. whi h roles may be used inside ertain on ept onstru tors,\n2. whi h roles may be used inside ertain role onstru tors,\n3. the ombination of role onstru tors, and\n4. the role onstru tors that may be used inside ertain on ept onstru tors.\nAs an example for the rst ase, onsider the fragment of ALCQ\nR\n+ in whi h transitive roles\nmay be used in existential and universal restri tions, but not in number restri tions (see, e.g., Horro ks et al., 2000).\nAs the result of taking the fusion of two DLs, we will obtain DLs whose set of roles N\nR\nis partitioned. For example, the fusion of ALCQ with ALC\n1\nyields a fragment of ALCQ\n1\nwhere N\nR\nis partitioned in two sets, say N\nR\n1\nand N\nR\n2\n. In this fragment, the inverse role\nonstru tor and roles from N\nR\n2\nmay not be used within quali ed number restri tions, while\nroles from N\nR\n1\nmay not be used inside the inverse role onstru tor.\n2\nThus, this DL is an\nexample for the rst, the se ond, and the fourth ase.\nNow onsider the DL ALCF introdu ed above, whi h does not only extend ALC\nf\nwith\nfeature (dis)agreement as a on ept onstru tor, but also provides the role omposition onstru tor. However, the role hains built using omposition have to be omprised ex lusively of features and non-fun tional roles may not appear inside feature (dis)agreement. Hen e, ALCF is also an example for the rst, se ond, and fourth ase.\nAs an example for the third ase, the fragment of ALC\n;u\nin whi h role onjun tion\nmay not be used inside the role omplement onstru tor is onsidered by Lutz and Sattler (2000).\nFor these restri ted DLs, we do not introdu e an expli it naming s heme. Note that, in this paper, we do not deal with DLs in whi h the ombinability of on ept onstru tors with ea h other is restri ted sin e these DLs would not t into the framework of abstra t des ription systems introdu ed in the next se tion. An example of su h a DL would be one with atomi negation of on epts, i.e., where negation may only be applied to on ept names (e.g., the DL AL dis ussed by Donini et al., 1997).\n3. Abstra t des ription systems\nIn order to de ne the fusion of DLs and prove general results for fusions of DLs, one needs a formal de nition of what are \\des ription logi s\". Sin e there exists a wide variety of DLs with very di erent hara teristi s, we introdu e a very general formalization, whi h should\nover all of the DLs onsidered in the literature, but also in ludes logi s that would usually\nnot be subsumed under the name DL.\n3.1 Syntax and semanti s\nThe syntax of an abstra t des ription system is given by its abstra t des ription language, whi h determines a set of terms, term assertions, and obje t assertions. In this setting,\non ept des riptions are represented by terms that are built using the abstra t des ription\n2. This will be ome learer on e we have given a formal de nition of the fusion.\nlanguage. General in lusion axioms in DLs are represented by term assertions and ABox assertions in DLs are represented by obje t assertions.\nDe nition 4 (Abstra t des ription language). An abstra t des ription language (ADL) is determined by a ountably in nite set V of set variables, a ountably in nite set X of obje t variables, a (possibly in nite) ountable set R of relation symbols of arity two, 3 and a (possibly in nite) ountable set F of fun tions symbols f , whi h are equipped with arities n\nf\n. All these sets have to be pairwise disjoint.\nThe terms t\nj\nof this ADL are built using the follow syntax rules:\nt\nj\n! x; :t\n1\n; t\n1\n^ t\n2\n; t\n1\n_ t\n2\n; f(t\n1\n; : : : ; t\nn\nf\n);\nwhere x 2 V , f 2 F , and the Boolean operators :;^;_ are di erent from all fun tion symbols in F . For a term t, we denote by var(t) the set of set variables used in t. The symbol > is used as an abbreviation of x_:x and ? as an abbreviation for x^:x (where x is a set variable).\nThe term assertions of this ADL are\nt\n1\nv t\n2\n, for all terms t\n1\n; t\n2\n,\nand the obje t assertions are\nR(a; b), for a; b 2 X and R 2 R;\n(a : t), for a 2 X and t a term.\nThe sets of term and obje t assertions together form the set of assertions of the ADL.\nFrom the DL point of view, the set variables orrespond to on ept names, obje t variables to individual names, relation symbols to roles, and the Boolean operators as well as the fun tion symbols orrespond to on ept onstru tors. Thus, terms orrespond to\non ept des riptions. As an example, let us view on ept des riptions of the DL ALCN\nu\n,\ni.e., ALC extended with number restri tions and onjun tion of roles, as terms of an ADL. Value restri tions and existential restri tions an be seen as unary fun tion symbols: for ea h role des ription R, we have the fun tion symbols f\n8R\nand f\n9R\n, whi h take a term t\nC\n( orresponding to the on ept des ription C) and transform it into the more omplex terms f\n8R\n(t\nC\n) and f\n9R\n(t\nC\n) ( orresponding to the on ept des riptions 8R:C and 9R:C). Similarly,\nnumber restri tions an be seen as nullary fun tion symbols: for ea h role des ription R and ea h n 2 N, we have the fun tion symbols f\nnR\nand f\nnR\n. Hen e, the ALCN\nu\n- on ept\ndes ription Au8(R\n1\nuR\n2\n)::(B u ( 2R\n1\n)) orresponds to the term x\nA\n^ f\n8(R\n1\nuR\n2\n)\n(:(x\nB\n^\nf\n( 2R\n1\n)\n)). We will analyze the onne tion between ADLs and DLs more formally later on. The semanti s of abstra t des ription systems is de ned based on abstra t des ription models. These models are the general semanti stru tures in whi h the terms of the ADL are interpreted. It should already be noted here, however, that an abstra t des ription system usually does not take into a ount all abstra t des ription models available for the language: it allows only for a sele ted sub lass of these models. This sub lass determines the semanti s of the system.\n3. To keep things simpler, we restri t our attention to the ase of binary predi ates, i.e., roles in DL.\nHowever, the results an easily be extended to n-ary predi ates.\nDe nition 5. Let L be an ADL as in De nition 4. An abstra t des ription model (ADM) for L is of the form\nW =\nD\nW;F\nW\n= ff\nW\nj f 2 Fg;R\nW\n= fR\nW\nj R 2 Rg\nE\n;\nwhere W is a nonempty set, the f\nW\nare fun tions mapping every sequen e X\n1\n; : : : ;X\nn\nf\nof subsets of W to a subset of W , and the R\nW\nare binary relations on W .\nSin e ADMs do not interpret variables, we need an assignment that assigns a subset of W to ea h set variable, before we an evaluate terms in an ADM. To evaluate obje t assertions, we need an additional assignment that assigns an element of W to ea h obje t variable.\nDe nition 6. Let L be an ADL andW = W;F\nW\n;R\nW\nbe an ADM for L. An assignment\nforW is a pair A = (A\n1\n;A\n2\n) su h that A\n1\nis a mapping from the set of set variables V into\n2\nW\n, and A\n2\nis an inje tive\n4\nmapping from the set of obje t variables X into W . Let W be\nan ADM and A = (A\n1\n;A\n2\n) be an assignment for W. With ea h L-term t, we indu tively\nasso iate a value t\nW;A\nin 2\nW\nas follows:\nx\nW;A\n:= A\n1\n(x) for all variables x 2 V ,\n(:t)\nW;A\n:=W n (t)\nW;A\n, (t\n1\n^ t\n2\n)\nW;A\n:= t\nW;A 1 \\ t W;A 2 , (t 1 _ t 2 ) W;A := t W;A 1 [ t W;A 2 ,\nf(t\n1\n; : : : ; t\nn\nf\n)\nW;A\n:= f\nW\n(t\nW;A 1 ; : : : ; t W;A n f ).\nIf x\n1\n; : : : ; x\nn\nare the set variables o urring in t, then we often write t\nW\n(X\n1\n; : : : ;X\nn\n) as\nshorthand for t\nW;A\n, where A is an assignment with x\nA i = X i for 1 i n.\nThe truth-relation j= between hW;Ai and assertions is de ned as follows:\nhW;Ai j= R(a; b) i A\n2\n(a)R\nW\nA\n2\n(b),\nhW;Ai j= a : t i A\n2\n(a) 2 t\nW;A\n,\nhW;Ai j= t\n1\nv t\n2\ni t\nW;A 1 t W;A 2 .\nIn this ase we say that the assertion is satis ed in hW;Ai. If, for an ADM W and a set of assertions , there exists an assignment A for W su h that ea h assertion in is satis ed in hW;Ai, then W is a model for .\nThere are two di eren es between ADMs and DL interpretations. First, in a DL interpretation, the interpretation of the role names xes the interpretation of the fun tion symbols orresponding to on ept onstru tors that involve roles (like value restri tions, number restri tions, et .). The interpretation of the on ept names orresponds to an assignment. Thus, a DL model is an ADM together with an assignment, whereas an ADM alone orresponds to what is alled frame in modal logi s. Se ond, in DL the roles used in\non ept onstru tors may, of ourse, also o ur in role assertions. In ontrast, the de nition of ADMs per se does not enfor e any onne tion between the interpretation of the fun tion symbols and the interpretation of the relation symbols. Su h onne tions an, however, be enfor ed by restri ting the attention to a sub lass of all possible ADMs for the ADL.\n4. This orresponds to the unique name assumption.\nDe nition 7. An abstra t des ription system (ADS) is a pair (L;M), where L is an ADL and M is a lass of ADMs for L that is losed under isomorphi opies. 5\nFrom the DL point of view, the hoi e of the lass M de nes the semanti s of the on ept and role onstru tors, and it allows us, e.g., to in orporate restri tions on role interpretations. In this sense, the ADS an be viewed as determining a (des ription) logi .\nTo be more on rete, in a DL interpretation the interpretation of the fun tion symbols is determined by the interpretation of the role names. Thus one an, for example, restri t the lass of models to ADMs that interpret a ertain role as a transitive relation or as the\nomposition of two other roles. Another restri tion that an be realized by the hoi e of M is that nominals ( orresponding to nullary fun tion symbols) must be interpreted as singleton sets.\nLet us now de ne reasoning problems for abstra t des ription systems. We will introdu e satis ability of sets of assertions (with or without term assertions), whi h orresponds to\nonsisten y of ABoxes (with or without GCIs), and satis ability of terms (with or without term assertions), whi h orresponds to satis ability of on ept des riptions (with or without GCIs).\nDe nition 8. Given an ADS (L;M), a nite set of assertions is alled satis able in (L;M) i there exists an ADM W 2 M and an assignment A for W su h that hW;Ai satis es all assertions in . The term t is alled satis able in (L;M) i fa : tg is satis able in (L;M), where a is an arbitrary obje t variable.\nThe satis ability problem for (L;M) is on erned with the following question: given a nite set of obje t assertions of L, is is satis able in (L;M).\nThe relativized satis ability problem for (L;M) is on erned with the following question: given a nite set of assertions of L, is is satis able in (L;M).\nThe term satis ability problem for (L;M) is on erned with the following question: given a term t of L, is t satis able in (L;M).\nThe relativized term satis ability problem for (L;M) is on erned with the following question: given a term t and a set of term assertions of L, is fa : tg [ satis able in (L;M).\nIn the next se tion, we will de ne the fusion of two ADSs, and show that (relativized) satis ability is de idable in the fusion if (relativized) satis ability in the omponent ADSs is de idable. For these transfer results to hold, we must restri t ourselves to so- alled lo al ADSs.\nDe nition 9. Given a family (W\np\n)\np2P\nof ADMs W\np\n= W\np\n;F\nW\np\n;R\nW\np\nover pairwise\ndisjoint domains W\np\n, we say that W = W;F\nW\n;R\nW\nis the disjoint union of (W\np\n)\np2P\ni\nW =\nS\np2P\nW\np\n,\n5. Intuitively, this means that, if an ADM W belongs to M, then all ADMs that di er from it only w.r.t.\nthe names of the elements in its domain W also belong toM.\nf\nW\n(X\n1\n; : : : ;X\nn\nf\n) =\nS\np2P\nf\nW\np\n(X\n1\n\\W\np\n; : : : ;X\nn\nf\n\\W\np\n) for all f 2 F and\nX\n1\n; : : : ;X\nn\nf\nW ,\nR\nW\n=\nS\np2P\nR\nW\np\nfor all R 2 R.\nAn ADS S = (L;M) is alled lo al i M is losed under disjoint unions.\nIn the remainder of this se tion, we rst analyze the onne tion between ADSs and DLs\nin more detail, and then omment on the relationship to modal logi s.\n3.2 Corresponden e to des ription logi s\nWe will show that the DLs introdu ed in Se tion 2 orrespond to ADSs. In order to do this, we rst need to introdu e frames, a notion well-known from modal logi . Let L be one of the DLs introdu ed in Se tion 2.\nDe nition 10 (Frames). An L-frame F is a pair (\nF\n;\nF\n), where\nF\nis a nonempty set,\nalled the domain of F, and\nF\nis the interpretation fun tion, whi h maps\nea h nominal I to a singleton subset I\nF\nof\nF\n, and\nea h role name R to a subset R\nF\nof\nF\nF\nsu h that the restri tions for role\ninterpretations in L are satis ed. For example, in ALC\nR\n+ , ea h R 2 N\nR\n+ is mapped\nto a transitive binary relation.\nThe interpretation fun tion\nF\nan indu tively be extended to omplex roles in the obvious\nway, i.e., by interpreting the role onstru tors in L a ording to their semanti s as given in Figure 2.\nAn interpretation I is based on a frame F i\nI\n=\nF\n, R\nI\n= R\nF\nfor all roles R 2 N\nR\n,\nand I\nI\n= I\nF\nfor all nominals I 2 N\nO\n.\nA frame an be viewed as an interpretation that is partial in the sense that the interpretation of individual and on ept names is not xed. Note that (in ontrast to the ase of\non ept and individual names) the interpretation of nominals is already xed in the frame. The reason for this is that, if we do not interpret nominals in the frame, then we have to treat them as set variables on the ADS side. These would, however, have to be variables to whi h only singleton sets may be assigned. Sin e su h a restri tion is not possible in the framework of ADSs as de ned above, we interpret nominals in the frame. The onsequen e is that they orrespond to fun tions of arity 0 on the ADS side.\nNow, we de ne the abstra t des ription system S = (L;M) orresponding to a DL L.\nIt is straightforward to translate the syntax of L into an abstra t des ription language L.\nDe nition 11 (Corresponding ADL). Let L be a DL with on ept and role onstru tors as well as restri tions on role interpretations as introdu ed in Se tion 2. The orresponding abstra t des ription language L is de ned as follows. For every on ept name A in L, there exists a set variable x\nA\nin L, and for every individual name i in L there exists an obje t\nvariable a\ni\nin L. Let R be the set of (possibly omplex) role des riptions of L. The set of\nrelation symbols of L isR, and the set of fun tion symbols of L is the smallest set ontaining\n1. for every role des ription R 2 R, unary fun tion symbols f\n9R\nand f\n8R\n,\n2. if L provides unquali ed number restri tions, then, for every n 2 N and every role\ndes ription R 2 R, fun tion symbols f\nnR\nand f\nnR\nof arity 0,\n3. if L provides quali ed number restri tions, then, for every n 2 N and every role R 2 R,\nunary fun tion symbols f\n_\nnR\nand f\n_\nnR\n,\n4. if L provides nominals, then, for every I 2 N\nO\n, a fun tion symbol f\nI\nof arity 0,\n5. if L provides feature agreement and disagreement, then, for every pair of feature hains\n(u\n1\n; u\n2\n), two fun tion symbols f\nu\n1\n#u\n2\nand f\nu\n1\n\"u\n2\nof arity 0.\nFor an L- on ept des ription C, let t\nC\ndenote the representation of C as an L-term,\nwhi h is de ned in the obvious way: on ept names A are translated into set variables x\nA\n,\nthe on ept onstru tors :, u, and t are mapped to :, ^, and _, respe tively, and all other\non ept onstru tors are translated to the orresponding fun tion symbols. Obviously, both\nthe sets of fun tion and relation symbols of L may be in nite.\nAn example of the translation of on ept des riptions into terms of an ADL was already\ngiven above: the ALCN\nu\n- on ept des ription A u 8(R\n1\nuR\n2\n)::(B u ( 2R\n1\n)) orresponds\nto the term x\nA\n^ f\n8(R\n1\nuR\n2\n)\n(:(x\nB\n^ f\n( 2R\n1\n)\n)).\nWe now de ne the set of abstra t des ription models M orresponding to the DL L.\nFor every L-frame, M ontains a orresponding ADM.\nDe nition 12 (Corresponding ADM). Let F = (\nF\n;\nF\n) be a frame. The orresponding\nabstra t des ription model W = W;F\nW\n;R\nW\nhas domainW :=\nF\n. The relation symbols\nof L are just the role des riptions of L, and thus they are interpreted in the frame F. For ea h relation symbol R 2 R we an hen e de ne R W := R F .\nTo de ne F\nW\n, we need to de ne f\nW\nfor every nullary fun tion symbol f in L, and\nf\nW\n(X) for every unary fun tion symbol f in L and every X\nI\n. Let A be an arbitrary\non ept name. For ea h X\nF\n, let I\nX\nbe the interpretation based on F mapping the\non ept name A to X and every other on ept name to ;.\n6\nTo de ne f\nW\n, we make a ase\ndistin tion a ording to the type of f :\n1. f\nW 9R (X) := (9R:A) I X , f W 8R (X) := (8R:A) I X ,\n2. f\nW\nnR\n:= ( nR)\nI\n;\n, f\nW\nnR\n:= ( nR)\nI\n;\n,\n3. f\nW _\nnR\n(X) := ( nR:A)\nI\nX\n, f\nW _\nnR\n(X) := ( nR:A)\nI\nX\n,\n4. f\nW I := I I ; ,\n5. f\nW u\n1\n#u\n2\n= (u\n1\n#u\n2\n)\nI\n;\n, f\nW u\n1\n\"u\n2\n= (u\n1\n\"u\n2\n)\nI\n;\n.\nThe lass of ADMs M thus obtained from a DL L is obviously losed under isomorphi opies sin e this also holds for the set of L-frames (independently of whi h DL L we\nonsider). Hen e, the tuple S = (L;M) orresponding to a DL L is indeed an ADS.\nAs an example, let us view the DL ALCN\nu\nas an ADS. The ADL L orresponding to\nALCN\nu\nhas already been dis ussed. Thus, we on entrate on the lass of ADMsM indu ed\n6. Taking the empty set here is arbitrary.\nby the frames of ALCN\nu\n. Assume that F is su h a frame, i.e., F onsists of a nonempty\ndomain and interpretations R\nF\nof the role names R. The ADMW = W;F\nW\n;R\nW\nindu ed\nby F is de ned as follows. The set W is identi al to the domain of F. Ea h role des ription yields a relation symbol, whi h is interpreted in W just as in the frame. For example, (R\n1\nu R\n2\n)\nW\n= R\nF 1 \\ R F 2 . It remains to de ne the interpretation of the fun tion symbols.\nWe illustrate this on two examples. First, onsider the (unary) fun tion symbol f\n8(R\n1\nuR\n2\n)\n.\nGiven a subset X of W , the fun tion f\nW 8(R\n1\nuR\n2\n)\nmaps X to\nf\nW 8(R\n1\nuR\n2\n)\n(X) := fw 2W j v 2 X for all v with (w; v) 2 R\nF 1 \\R F 2 g;\ni.e., the interpretation of the on ept des ription 8(R\n1\nuR\n2\n):A in the interpretations based\non F interpreting A by X. A ordingly, the value of the onstant symbol f\n( 2R)\nin W is\ngiven by the interpretation of ( 2R) in the interpretations based on F.\nIt is easy to show that the interpretation of on ept des riptions in L oin ides with the\ninterpretation of the orresponding terms in S = (L;M).\nLemma 13. Let F be a frame, W = W;F\nW\n;R\nW\nbe the ADM orresponding to F, A =\n(A\n1\n;A\n2\n) be an assignment for W, C be a on ept des ription, and let the on ept names\nused in C be among A\n1\n; : : : ; A\nk\n. For all interpretations I based on F with A\nI i = A 1 (x A i )\nfor all 1 i k, we have that\nC\nI\n= t\nW;A C :\nAs an easy onsequen e of this lemma, there is a lose onne tion between reasoning in a DL L and reasoning in the orresponding ADS. Given a TBox T and an ABox A of the DL L, we de ne the orresponding set S(T ;A) of assertions of the orresponding ADL (L;M) in the obvious way, i.e., ea h GCI C v D in T yields a term assertion t\nC\nv t\nD\n, ea h\nrole assertion R(i; j) in A yields an obje t assertion R(a\ni\n; a\nj\n), and ea h on ept assertion\nC(i) yields an obje t assertion a\ni\n: t\nC\n.\nProposition 14. The ABox A is onsistent relative to the TBox T in L i S(T ;A) is satis able in the orresponding ADS.\nWe do not treat non-relativized onsisten y expli itly sin e it is the spe ial ase of\nrelativized onsisten y where the TBox is empty.\nAs already mentioned above, our transfer results require the omponent ADSs to be lo al. We all a DL L lo al i the ADS (L;M) orresponding to L is lo al. It turns out that not all DLs introdu ed in Se tion 2 are lo al.\nProposition 15. Let L be one of the DLs introdu ed in Se tion 2. Then, L is lo al i L does not in lude any of the following onstru tors: nominals, role omplement, universal role.\nProof. We start with the \\only if\" dire tion, whi h is more interesting sin e it shows why ADSs orresponding to DLs with nominals, role omplement, or the universal role are not lo al. We make a ase distin tion a ording to whi h of these onstru tors L ontains.\nNominals. Consider the disjoint union W of the ADMs W\n1\nand W\n2\n, and assume\nthat W\n1\nand W\n2\norrespond to frames of a DL with nominals. By de nition of the\ndisjoint union, we know that\nW\n1\n\\\nW\n2\n= ;. If I 2 N\nO\nis a nominal, then the\nde nition of the disjoint union implies that f\nW I = f\nW\n1\nI\n[ f\nW\n2\nI\n. Sin e nominals are\ninterpreted by singleton sets in W\n1\nand W\n2\n, and sin e the domains of W\n1\nand W\n2\nare disjoint, this implies that f\nW I is a set of ardinality 2. Consequently, W annot\norrespond to an ADM indu ed by a frame for a DL with nominals, sin e su h frames\ninterpret nominals by singleton sets.\nUniversal role. Again, onsider the disjoint unionW of the ADMsW\n1\nandW\n2\n, and\nassume thatW\n1\nandW\n2\norrespond to frames of a DL with the universal role. Let U\ndenote the universal role, i.e., a role name for whi h the interpretation is restri ted to the binary relation relating ea h pair of individuals of the domain. By the de nition of the disjoint union, we have U W = U W 1 [U W 2 = W 1 W 1 [ W 2 W 2 6= W W . Consequently, W annot orrespond to an ADM indu ed by a frame for a DL with universal role, sin e su h a frame would interpret U by W W .\nRole omplement. Again, onsider the disjoint unionW of the ADMsW\n1\nandW\n2\n,\nand assume thatW\n1\nandW\n2\norrespond to frames of a DL with role negation. For an\narbitrary role name R, we have R\nW\n= R\nW\n1\n[R\nW\n2\n= (\nW\n1\nW\n1\nn R\nW\n1\n) [ (\nW\n2\nW\n2\nn R\nW\n2\n) 6= (\nW\n1\n[\nW\n2\n) n (R\nW\n1\n[R\nW\n2\n) =\nW\nn R\nW\n.\nIt remains to prove the \\if\" dire tion. Assume that L is one of the DLs introdu ed in Se tion 2 that does not allow for nominals, role omplements, and the universal role. Let (F\np\n)\np2P\nbe a family of L-frames F\np\n= (\nF\np\n;\nF\np\n) and let W\np\n= W\np\n;F\nW\np\n;R\nW\np\nbe the\nADMs orresponding to them. By de nition,\nF\np\n= W\np\nfor all p 2 P . Assume that the\ndomains (W\np\n)\np2P\nare pairwise disjoint. We must show that the disjoint union of (W\np\n)\np2P\nalso orresponds to an L-frame. To this purpose, we de ne the frame F = (\nF\n;\nF\n) as\nfollows:\nF\n:=\nS\np2P\nF\np\nand\nR\nF\n:=\nS\np2P\nR\nF\np\nfor all R 2 N\nR\n.\nLet W = W;F\nW\n;R\nW\n2 M be the ADM orresponding to F. By De nition 12 ( or-\nresponding ADM), we have W =\nS\np2P\nW\np\nand R\nW\n=\nS\np2P\nR\nW\np\nfor all R 2 N\nR\n. By\nindu tion on the stru ture of omplex roles, it is easy to show that this also holds for all R 2 R, i.e., all omplex role des riptions. For example, onsider the role des ription\nR\n1\nÆ R\n2\n. By indu tion, we know that R\nW 1 =\nS\np2P\nR\nW\np\n1\nand R\nW 2 =\nS\np2P\nR\nW\np\n2\n. Sin e the\nsets (W\np\n)\np2P\nare pairwise disjoint,\n(R\n1\nÆ R\n2\n)\nW\n= R\nW 1 Æ R W 2 =\n[\np2P\nR\nW\np\n1\nÆ\n[\np2P\nR\nW\np\n2\n=\n[\np2P\nR\nW\np\n1\nÆR\nW\np\n2\n=\n[\np2P\n(R\n1\nÆR\n2\n)\nW\np\n:\nSin e R\nW\np\n= R\nF\np\nfor all R 2 R and p 2 P , we obtain the following fa t:\n( ) For all p 2 P , a 2\nF\np\n, and role des riptions R 2 R, the following holds: R\nF\n(a) =\nR\nF\np\n(a); in parti ular, R\nF\n(a)\nF\np\n.\nIt remains to show that, for all n 0, all X\n1\n; : : : ;X\nn\nW , and all fun tion symbols f of\narity n, we have\nf\nW\n(X\n1\n; : : : ;X\nn\n) =\n[\np2P\nf\nW\np\n(X\n1\n\\W\np\n; : : : ;X\nn\n\\W\np\n):\nThis an be proved by making a ase distin tion a ording to the type of f . We treat two\nases exemplarily.\nf = f\nu\n1\n#u\n2\n. Sin e W =\nS\np2P\nW\np\nand the sets W\np\nare pairwise disjoint, f\nW u\n1\n#u\n2\nis the\ndisjoint union of the sets f\nW u\n1\n#u\n2\n\\W\np\nfor p 2 P . It remains to show that f\nW u\n1\n#u\n2\n\\W\np\n=\nf\nW\np\nu\n1\n#u\n2\n(p 2 P ). By de nition of f\nW\np\nu\n1\n#u\n2\n, we know that a 2 f\nW\np\nu\n1\n#u\n2\ni a 2\nF\np\n, both\nu\nF\np\n1\n(a) and u\nF\np\n2\n(a) are de ned, and u\nF\np\n1\n(a) = u\nF\np\n2\n(a). By ( ), this is the ase i\na 2\nF\np\n, both u\nF 1 (a) and u F 2 (a) are de ned and u F 1 (a) = u F 2 (a), whi h is equivalent to\na 2 f\nW u\n1\n#u\n2\n\\W\np\n.\nf = f\n_\nnR\n. Sin e W =\nS\np2P\nW\np\nand the sets W\np\nare pairwise disjoint, f\nW _\nnR\n(X) is\nthe disjoint union of the sets f\nW _\nnR\n(X) \\ W\np\nfor p 2 P . It remains to show that\nf\nW _\nnR\n(X) \\ W\np\n= f\nW\np\n_\nnR\n(X \\ W\np\n) (p 2 P ). By de nition of f\nW\np\n_\nnR\n, we know that\na 2 f\nW\np\n_\nnR\n(X \\W\np\n) i a 2\nF\np\nand jR\nF\np\n(a)\\ (X \\W\np\n)j n.

Hen e, the \\only if\" dire tion of the proposition implies that our results are not appli able to fusions of ADSs orresponding to DLs that in orporate nominals, role\nomplement, or the universal role.\n3.3 Corresponden e to modal logi s\nIn this paper our on ern are fusions of des ription logi s and not modal logi s. Nevertheless, it is useful to have a brief look at the relationship between ADSs and modal logi . Standard modal languages an be regarded as ADLs without relation symbols and obje t variables (just identify propositional formulas with terms). Given su h an ADL L, a set L of L-terms is alled a lassi al modal logi i is ontains all tautologies of lassi al propositional logi and is losed under modus ponens, substitutions, and the regularity rule\nx\n1\n$ y\n1\n; : : : ; x\nn\nf\n$ y\nn\nf\nf(x\n1\n; : : : ; x\nn\nf\n)$ f(y\n1\n; : : : ; y\nn\nf\n)\nfor all fun tion symbols f of L. The minimal lassi al modal logi in the language with one unary fun tion symbol is known as the logi E (see Chellas, 1980).\nAny ADS (L;M) based on L determines a lassi al modal logi L by taking the valid\nterms, i.e., by de ning\nt 2 L i t\nW;A\n=W for all W 2M and assignments A in W:\nThe logi E is determined by the ADS with pre isely one unary operator whose lass of ADMs onsists of all models. Chellas formulates this ompleteness result (Theorem 9.8 in Chellas, 1980) for so- alled minimal models (alias neighborhood-frames), whi h are, however, just a notational variant of abstra t des ription models with one unary operator (Do sen, 1988). If the lassi al modal logi L is determined by an ADS with de idable term satis ability problem, then L is de idable sin e t 2 L i :t is unsatis able.\nA lassi al modal logi L is alled normal i it additionally ontains\nf(x\n1\n; : : : ; x\nj 1\n; x\nj\n^ y\nj\n; x\nj+1\n; : : : ; x\nn\nf\n) $ f(x\n1\n; : : : ; x\nj 1\n; x\nj\n; x\nj+1\n; : : : ; x\nn\nf\n) ^\nf(x\n1\n; : : : ; x\nj 1\n; y\nj\n; x\nj+1\n; : : : ; x\nn\nf\n)\nand\nf(>;?; : : : ;?); f(?;>;?; : : : ;?); : : : ; f(?; : : : ;?;>);\nfor all fun tion symbols f and all j with 1 j n\nf\n(J onsson & Tarski, 1951; J onsson &\nTarski, 1952; Goldblatt, 1989). This de nition of normal modal logi s assumes that the formulas (terms) are built using only ne essity (box) operators. 7 We will work here only with ne essity operators; the orresponding possibility-operators are de nable by putting\nf\n3\n(x\n1\n; : : : ; x\nn\nf\n) = :f(:x\n1\n; : : : ;:x\nn\nf\n):\nThe minimal normal modal logi in the language with one unary operator is known as K (Chellas, 1980).\nWe all a fun tion F :W\nn\n!W normal i for all 1 j n and X\n1\n; : : : ;X\nn\n; Y\nj\nW\nF (X\n1\n; : : : ;X\nj 1\n;X\nj\n\\ Y\nj\n;X\nj+1\n; : : : ;X\nn\n) = F (X\n1\n; : : : ;X\nj 1\n;X\nj\n;X\nj+1\n; : : : ;X\nn\n) \\\nF (X\n1\n; : : : ;X\nj 1\n; Y\nj\n;X\nj+1\n; : : : ;X\nn\n))\nand\nF (W; ;; : : : ; ;) = F (;;W; ;; : : : ; ;) = = F (;; : : : ; ;;W ) =W:\nNote that a unary fun tion F is normal i F (W ) =W and F (X \\ Y ) = F (X) \\ F (Y ), for any X;Y W . A fun tion symbol f is alled normal in an ADS (L;M) i the fun tions f W are normal for all W 2M.\nFor any role R of some DL, the fun tion symbol f\n8R\nis normal in the orresponding\nADS. To the ontrary, it is readily he ked that neither f\n_\nnR\nand f\n_\nnR\nnor their duals\nf\n3 _\nnR\nand f\n3 _\nnR\nare normal.\nObviously, an ADS (L;M) determines a normal modal logi i all fun tion symbols of L are normal in (L;M). Completeness of K with respe t to Kripke semanti s (Chellas, 1980) implies that the logi K is determined by the ADS with one unary operator whose\nlass of ADMs onsists of all models interpreting this operator by a normal fun tion.\n7. Note that some authors de ne normal modal logi s using possibility (diamond) operators, in whi h ase\nthe de nitions are the duals of what we have introdu ed and thus at rst sight look quite di erent.\n4. Fusions of abstra t des ription systems\nIn this se tion, we de ne the fusion of abstra t des ription systems and prove two transfer theorems for de idability, one on erning satis ability and the other one on erning relativized satis ability.\nDe nition 16. The fusion S\n1\nS\n2\n= (L\n1\nL\n2\n;M\n1\nM\n2\n) of two abstra t des ription\nsystems S\n1\n= (L\n1\n;M\n1\n) and S\n2\n= (L\n2\n;M\n2\n) over\ndisjoint sets of fun tion symbols F of L\n1\nand G of L\n2\n,\ndisjoint sets of relation symbols R of L\n1\nand Q of L\n2\n, and\nthe same sets of set and obje t variables\nis de ned as follows: L\n1\nL\n2\nis the ADL based on\nthe union F [ G of the fun tion symbols of L\n1\nand L\n2\n, and\nthe union R [Q of the relation symbols of L\n1\nand L\n2\n,\nand M\n1\nM\n2\nis de ned as\nf\nD\nW;F\nW\n[ G\nW\n;R\nW\n[Q\nW\nE\nj\nD\nW;F\nW\n;R\nW\nE\n2M\n1\nand\nD\nW;G\nW\n;Q\nW\nE\n2M\n2\ng:\nAs an example, onsider the ADSs S\n1\nand S\n2\norresponding to the DLs ALCF and\nALC\n+;Æ;t\nintrodu ed in Se tion 2. We on entrate on the fun tion symbols provided by\ntheir fusion. In the following, we assume that the set of role names employed by ALCF and ALC +;Æ;t are disjoint.\nThe ADS S\n1\nis based on the following fun tion symbols: (i) unary fun tions symbol\nf\n8R\nand f\n9R\nfor every role name R of ALCF , (ii) nullary fun tions symbols orre-\nsponding to the same-as onstru tor for every pair of hains of fun tional roles of ALCF .\nThe ADS S\n2\nis based on the following fun tion symbols: (iii) unary fun tions symbol\nf\n8Q\nand f\n9Q\nfor every role des ription Q built from role names of ALC\n+;Æ;t\nusing\nunion, omposition, and transitive losure.\nSin e we assumed that the set of role names employed by ALCF and ALC\n+;Æ;t\nare disjoint,\nthese sets of fun tion symbols are also disjoint. The union of these sets provides us both with the symbols for the same-as onstru tor and with the symbols for value and existential restri tions on role des riptions involving union, omposition, and transitive losure. However, the role des riptions ontain only role names from ALC +;Æ;t , and thus none of the fun tional roles of ALCF o urs in su h des riptions. Thus, the fusion of ALCF and ALC +;Æ;t yields a stri t fragment of their union ALCF +;Æ;t .\n4.1 Relativized satis ability\nWe prove a transfer result for de idability of the relativized satis ability problem, show that this also yields a orresponding transfer result for the relativized term satis ability problem, and investigate how these transfer results an be extended to ADSs that orrespond to DLs providing for the universal role.\n4.1.1 The transfer result\nThis se tion is on erned with establishing the following transfer theorem:\nTheorem 17. Let S\n1\nand S\n2\nbe lo al ADSs, and suppose that the relativized satis ability\nproblems for S\n1\nand S\n2\nare de idable. Then the relativized satis ability problem for S\n1\nS\n2\nis also de idable.\nThe idea underlying the proof of this theorem is to translate a given set of assertions\nof S\n1\nS\n2\ninto a set of assertions\n1\nof S\n1\nand a set of assertions\n2\nof S\n2\nsu h that is\nsatis able in S\n1\nS\n2\ni\n1\nis satis able in S\n1\nand\n2\nis satis able in S\n2\n. The rst (naive)\nidea for how to obtain the set\ni\n(i = 1; 2) is to repla e in alien terms (i.e., subterms\nstarting with fun tion symbols not belonging to S\ni\n) by new set variables (the surrogate\nvariables introdu ed below). With this approa h, satis ability of would in fa t imply satis ability of the sets\ni\n, but the onverse would not be true. The diÆ ulty arises when\ntrying to ombine the models of\n1\nand\n2\ninto one for . To ensure that the two models\nan indeed be ombined, the sets\ni\nmust ontain additional assertions that make sure that\nthe surrogate variables in one model and the orresponding alien subterms in the other model are interpreted in a \\ ompatible\" way. To be more pre ise, there are ( nitely many) di erent ways of adding su h assertions, and one must try whi h of them (if any) leads to a satis able pair\n1\nand\n2\n.\nFor the proof of Theorem 17, we x two lo al ADSs S\ni\n= (L\ni\n;M\ni\n), i 2 f1; 2g, in whi h\nL\n1\nis based on the set of fun tion symbols F and relation symbols R, and L\n2\nis based on G\nand Q. Let L = L\n1\nL\n2\nand M =M\n1\nM\n2\n.\nIn what follows, we use the following notation: for a set of assertions , denote by\nterm( ) and obj( ) the set of terms and obje t names in , respe tively.\nWe start with explaining how alien subterms in the set an be repla ed by new set\nvariables. For ea h L-term t of the form h(t\n1\n; : : : ; t\nn\n), h 2 F [G, we reserve a new variable\nx\nt\n, whi h will be alled the surrogate of t. We assume that the set of surrogate variables is disjoint to the original sets of variables. As sket hed above, the idea underlying the introdu tion of surrogate variables is that the de ision pro edure for S\n1\n(S\n2\n) annot deal\nwith terms ontaining fun tion symbols from G (F). Thus, these \\alien\" fun tion symbols must be repla ed before applying the pro edure. To be more pre ise, we repla e the whole alien subterm starting with the alien fun tion symbol by its surrogate. For example, if the unary symbol f belongs to F , and the unary symbol g belongs to G, then f(g(f(x))) is a \\mixed\" L-term. To obtain a term of L\n1\n, we repla e the subterm g(f(x)) by its surrogate,\nwhi h yields f(x\ng(f(x))\n). Analogously, to obtain a term of L\n2\n, we repla e the whole term\nby its surrogate, whi h yields x\nf(g(f(x)))\n. We now de ne this repla ement pro ess more\nformally.\nDe nition 18. For an L-term t without surrogate variables, denote by sur\n1\n(t) the L\n1\n-term\nresulting from t when all o urren es of terms g(t\n1\n; : : : ; t\nn\n), g 2 G, that are not within the\ns ope of some g\n0\n2 G are repla ed by their surrogate variable x\ng(t\n1\n;:::;t\nn\n)\n. For a set of\nterms, put sur\n1\n( ) := fsur\n1\n(t) j t 2 g and de ne sur\n2\n(t) as well as sur\n2\n( ) a ordingly.\nDenote by sub( ) the set of subterms of terms in , and by sub\n1\n( ) the variables\no urring in as well as the subterms of alien terms (i.e., terms starting with a symbol\nfrom G) in . More formally, we an de ne\nsub\n1\n( ) := subft j x\nt\n2 var(sur\n1\n( ))g [ var( ):\nDe ne sub\n2\n( ) a ordingly.\nFor example, let f 2 F be unary and g 2 G be binary. If t = f(g(x; f(g(x; y)))), then\nsur\n1\n(t) = f(x\ng(x;f(g(x;y)))\n). Note that the restri tion \\not within the s ope of some g\n0\n2 G\"\nis there to larify that only the top-most alien subterms are to be repla ed. For the term t of this example, we have sub 1 (ftg) = fg(x; f(g(x; y))); f(g(x; y)); g(x; y); x; yg.\nNote that the Boolean operators o urring in terms are \\shared\" fun tion symbols in\nthe sense that they are alien to neither L\n1\nnor L\n2\n. Thus, sur\n1\n(f(x)^g(x; y)) = f(x)^x\ng(x;y)\nand sur\n2\n(f(x) ^ g(x; y)) = x\nf(x)\n^ g(x; y).\nOf ourse, when repla ing whole terms by variables, some information is lost. For\nexample, onsider the (in onsistent) assertion (9R\n1\n:(( 1R\n2\n)u( 2R\n2\n)))(i) and assume that\nR\n1\nis a role of one omponent of a fusion, and R\n2\na role of the other omponent. Translated\ninto abstra t des ription language syntax, the on ept des ription 9R\n1\n:(( 1R\n2\n)u ( 2R\n2\n))\nyields the term t := f\n9R\n1\n(f\n( 1R\n2\n)\n^ f\n( 2R\n2\n)\n), where f\n9R\n1\nis a fun tion symbol of L\n1\nand\nthe other two fun tion symbols belong to L\n2\n. Now, sur\n1\n(t) = f\n9R\n1\n(x ^ y), where x is the\nsurrogate for f\n( 1R\n2\n)\nand y is the surrogate for f\n( 2R\n2\n)\n. If the de ision pro edure for the\nrst ADS only sees f\n9R\n1\n(x ^ y), it has no way to know that the onjun tion of the alien\nsubterms orresponding to x and y is unsatis able. In fa t, for this pro edure x and y are arbitrary set variables, and thus x ^ y is satis able. To avoid this problem, we introdu e so- alled onsisten y set onsisting of \\types\", where a type says for ea h \\relevant\" formula whether the formula itself or its negation is supposed to hold. The sets\n1\nand\n2\nwill then\nontain additional information that basi ally ensures that their models satisfy the same\ntypes. This will allow us to merge these models into one for .\nDe nition 19. Given a nite set of L-terms, we de ne the onsisten y set C( ) of as C( ) := ft j g, where the type t determined by is de ned as\nt :=\n^\nf j 2 g ^\n^\nf: j 2 n g:\nGiven a nite set of assertions in L, we de ne sub\ni\n( ) := sub\ni\n(term( )). We abbreviate\nC\ni\n( ) := C(sub\ni\n( )), for i 2 f1; 2g.\nIn the example above, we have\nsub\n1\n(f\n9R\n1\n(f\n( 1R\n2\n)\n^ f\n( 2R\n2\n)\n) = ff\n( 1R\n2\n)\n; f\n( 2R\n2\n)\ng;\nand thus C\n1\n(fa\ni\n: f\n9R\n1\n(f\n( 1R\n2\n)\n^ f\n( 2R\n2\n)\n)g) onsists of the 4 terms\nf\n( 1R\n2\n)\n^ f\n( 2R\n2\n)\n;\nf\n( 1R\n2\n)\n^ :f\n( 2R\n2\n)\n;\n:f\n( 1R\n2\n)\n^ f\n( 2R\n2\n)\n; and\n:f\n( 1R\n2\n)\n^ :f\n( 2R\n2\n)\n:\nGiven a set of terms , an element t of its onsisten y set C( ) an indeed be onsidered as the \\type\" of an element e of the domain of an ADM w.r.t. . Any su h element e belongs to the interpretations of some of the terms in , and to the omplements of the interpretations of the other terms. Thus, if is the set of terms of to whi h e belongs, then e also belongs to the interpretation of t and it does not belong to the interpretation of any of the other terms in C( ). In this ase we say that e realizes the type t .\nWe are now ready to formulate the theorem that redu es the relativized satis ability problem in a fusion of two lo al ADSs to relativized satis ability in the omponent ADSs. A proof of this theorem an be found in the appendix.\nTheorem 20. Let S\ni\n= (L\ni\n;M\ni\n), i 2 f1; 2g, be two lo al ADSs in whi h L\n1\nis based on\nthe set of fun tion symbols F and relation symbols R, and L\n2\nis based on G and Q, and\nlet L = L\n1\nL\n2\nand M = M\n1\nM\n2\n. If is a nite set of assertions from L, then the\nfollowing are equivalent:\n1. is satis able in (L;M).\n2. There exist\n(a) a set D C\n1\n( ),\n(b) for every term t 2 D an obje t variable a\nt\n62 obj( ),\n( ) for every a 2 obj( ) a term t\na\n2 D,\nsu h that the union\n1\nof the following sets of assertions in L\n1\nis satis able in\n(L\n1\n;M\n1\n):\n(d) fa\nt\n: sur\n1\n(t) j t 2 Dg [ f> v sur\n1\n(\nW\nD)g,\n(e) fa : sur\n1\n(t\na\n) j a 2 obj( )g,\n(f) fR(a; b) j R(a; b) 2 ; R 2 Rg,\n(g) fsur\n1\n(t\n1\n) v sur\n1\n(t\n2\n) j t\n1\nv t\n2\n2 g [ fa : sur\n1\n(s) j (a : s) 2 g;\nand the union\n2\nof the following sets of assertions in L\n2\nis satis able in (L\n2\n;M\n2\n):\n(h) fa\nt\n: sur\n2\n(t) j t 2 Dg [ f> v sur\n2\n(\nW\nD)g,\n(i) fa : sur\n2\n(t\na\n) j a 2 obj( )g,\n(j) fQ(a; b) j Q(a; b) 2 ; Q 2 Qg.\nIntuitively, (2a) \\guesses\" a set D of types (i.e., elements of the onsisten y set). The idea is that these are exa tly the types that are realized in the model of (to be onstru ted when showing (2 ! 1) and given when showing (1 ! 2)). Condition (2b) introdu es for every type in D a name for an obje t realizing this type, and (2 ) \\guesses\" for every obje t variable o urring in a type from D.\nRegarding (2d) and (2h), one should note that the set of assertions fa\nt\n: t j t 2 Dg[f> v\nW\nDg states that every type in D is realized (i.e., there is an obje t in the model having this type) and that every obje t has one of the types in D. The sets of assertions (2d) and (2h) are obtained from this set through surrogation to make it digestible by the de ision pro edures of the omponent logi s.\nThe assertions in (2e) and (2i) state (again in surrogated versions) that the obje t\ninterpreting the variable a has type t\na\n. This ensures that, in the models of\n1\nand\n2\n(given when showing (2 ! 1)), the obje ts interpreting a have the same type t\na\nfrom D.\nOtherwise, these models ould not be ombined into a ommon one for .\nThe sets (2f) and (2j) are obtained from by distributing its relationship assertions\nbetween\n1\nand\n2\n, depending on the relation symbol used in the assertion.\nThe set (2g) ontains (in surrogated version) the term assertions of the form t\n1\nv t\n2\nand\nthe membership assertions of the form a : s of .\nCondition 2 is asymmetri in two respe ts. First, it guesses a subset of C\n1\n( ) rather than\na subset of C\n2\n( ). Of ourse this is arbitrary, we ould also have hosen index 2 instead\nof 1 here. Se ond, the set\n2\nneither ontains the assertions fsur\n2\n(t\n1\n) v sur\n2\n(t\n2\n) j t\n1\nv\nt\n2\n2 g nor fa : sur\n2\n(s) j (a : s) 2 g. If we added these assertions, the theorem would\nstill be true, but this would unne essarily in rease the amount of work to be done by the\nombined de ision pro edure. In fa t, sin e the other assertions in\n1\nand\n2\nenfor e a tight\noordination between the models of\n1\nand\n2\n, the fa t that the membership assertions and\nterm assertions of are satis ed in the models of\n1\nimplies that they are also satis ed in\nthe models of\n2\n(see the appendix for details).\nTo prove Theorem 17, we must show how Theorem 20 an be used to onstru t a\nde ision pro edure for relativized satis ability in S\n1\nS\n2\nfrom su h de ision pro edures for\nthe omponent systems S\n1\nand S\n2\n. For a given nite set of assertions of S\n1\nS\n2\n, the set\nC\n1\n( ) is also nite, and thus there are nitely many sets D in (2a) and hoi es of types for obje t variables in (2 ). Consequently, we an enumerate all of them and he k whether one of these hoi es leads to satis able sets\n1\nand\n2\n. By de nition of the sets\ni\nand of\nthe fun tions sur\ni\n, the assertions in\ni\nare indeed assertions of L\ni\n, and thus the satis ability\nalgorithm for (L\ni\n;M\ni\n) an be applied to\ni\n. This proves Theorem 17.\nRegarding the omplexity of the obtained de ision pro edure, the ostly step is guessing\nthe right set D. Sin e the ardinality of the set sub\n1\n( ) is linear in the size of , the\nardinality of C\n1\n( ) is exponential in the size of (and ea h element of it has size quadrati\nin ). Thus, there are doubly exponentially many di erent subsets to be hosen from. Sin e the ardinality of the hosen set D may be exponential in the size of , also the size of\n1\nand\n2\nmay be exponential in (be ause of the big disjun tion over D). From this, the\nfollowing orollary follows.\nCorollary 21. Let S\n1\nand S\n2\nbe lo al ADSs, and suppose that the relativized satis ability\nproblems for S\n1\nand S\n2\nare de idable in ExpTime (PSpa e). Then the relativized satis -\nability problem for S\n1\nS\n2\nis de idable in 2ExpTime (ExpSpa e).\nProof. Assume that has size n. Then we must onsider 2\n2\np\n1\n(n)\n(for some polynomial p\n1\n)\ndi erent sets D in (2a). Ea h su h set has size 2\np\n1\n(n)\nand thus we have of 2\n2\np\n2\n(n)\nhoi es\nin (2 ) (for some polynomial p\n2\n). Overall, this still leaves us with doubly exponentially\nmany hoi es. Now assume that the relativized satis ability problems for S\n1\nand S\n2\nare\nde idable in ExpTime. Sin e ea h all of these pro edures is applied to a set of assertions of exponential size, it may take double exponential time, say 2 2 p 3 (n) and 2 2 p 4 (n) (for polynomials p\n3\nand p\n4\n). Overall, we thus have a time omplexity of\n2\n2\np\n1\n(n)\n2\n2\np\n2\n(n)\n(2\n2\np\n3\n(n)\n+ 2\n2\np\n4\n(n)\n);\nwhi h an learly be majorized by 2\n2\np(n)\nfor an appropriate polynomial p. This shows\nmembership in 2ExpTime.\nThe argument regarding the spa e omplexity is similar. Here one must additionally take into a ount that doubly exponentially many hoi es an be enumerated using an exponentially large ounter. ❏\n4.1.2 The relativized term satisfiability problem\nThe statement of Theorem 17 itself does not imply a transfer result for the relativized term satis ability problem. The problem is that de idability of the relativized term satis ability problem in S\n1\nand S\n2\ndoes not ne essarily imply de idability of the relativized satis ability\nproblem in these ADSs, and thus the prerequisite for the theorem to apply is not satis ed. However, if we onsider the statement of Theorem 20, then it is easy to see that this theorem also yields a transfer result for the relativized term satis ability problem.\nCorollary 22. Let S\n1\nand S\n2\nbe lo al ADSs, and suppose that the relativized term satis a-\nbility problems for S\n1\nand S\n2\nare de idable. Then the relativized term satis ability problem\nfor S\n1\nS\n2\nis also de idable.\nProof. Consider the satis ability riterion in Theorem 20. If we are interested in relativized term satis ability, then is of the form fa : tg [ 0 , where 0 is a set of term assertions. In this ase, the sets of assertions\n1\nand\n2\ndo not ontain obje t assertions\ninvolving relations. Now, assume that\ni\nis of the form fa\n1\n: t\n1\n; : : : ; a\nn\n: t\nn\ng [\n0 i , where 0 i\nis a set of term assertions. Sin e two assertions of the form b : s\n1\n; b : s\n2\nare equivalent to\none assertion b : s\n1\n^ s\n2\n, we may assume that the a\ni\nare distin t from ea h other. Sin e S\ni\nis lo al, it is easy to see that the following are equivalent:\n1. fa\n1\n: t\n1\n; : : : ; a\nn\n: t\nn\ng [\n0 i is satis able in S i .\n2. fa\nj\n: t\nj\ng [\n0 i is satis able in S i for all j = 1; : : : ; n.\nSin e (1 ! 2) is trivial, it is enough to show (2 ! 1). Given models W\nj\n2 M\ni\nof fa\nj\n:\nt\nj\ng [\n0 i (j = 1; : : : ; n), their disjoint union also belongs to M i , and it is learly a model of\nfa\n1\n: t\n1\n; : : : ; a\nn\n: t\nn\ng [\n0 i .\nThe se ond ondition an now be he ked by applying the term satis ability test in S\ni\nn times. ❏\n4.1.3 Dealing with the universal role\nAs stated above (Proposition 15), ADSs orresponding to DLs with the universal role are not lo al, and thus Theorem 17 annot be applied dire tly. Nevertheless, in some ases this theorem an also be used to obtain a de idability result for fusions of DLs with the universal role, provided that both of them provide for a universal role. (We will omment on the usefulness of this approa h in more detail in Se tion 5.4).\nDe nition 23. Given an ADS S = (L;M), we denote by S\nU\nthe ADS obtained from S by\n1. extending L with two fun tion symbols f\n9U\nS\nand f\n8U\nS\n, and\n2. extending every ADM W = W;F\nW\n;R\nW\n2 M with the unary fun tions f\nW 9U\nS\nand\nf\nW 8U\nS\n, where\nf\nW 9U\nS\n(X) = ; if X = ;, and f\nW 9U\nS\n(X) =W otherwise;\nf\nW 8U\nS\n(X) =W if X =W , and f\nW 8U\nS\n(X) = ; otherwise.\nFor ADSs S orresponding to a DL L, the ADS S\nU\norresponds to the extension of L\nwith the universal role, where the universal role an only be used within value and existential restri tions. 8 There is a lose onne tion between the relativized satis ability problem in S and the satis ability problem in S U .\nProposition 24. If S is a lo al ADS, then the following onditions are equivalent:\n1. the relativized (term) satis ability problem for S is de idable,\n2. the (term) satis ability problem for S\nU\nis de idable,\n3. the relativized (term) satis ability problem for S\nU\nis de idable.\nProof. We restri t our attention to the term satis ability problem sin e the equivalen es for the satis ability problem an be proved similarly.\nThe impli ation (3! 2) is trivial, and (2! 1) is easy to show. In fa t, t is satis able in\nS relative to the term assertions fs\n1\nv t\n1\n; : : : ; s\nn\nv t\nn\ng i t^f\n8U\nS\n:((:t\n1\n_s\n1\n)^: : :^(:t\nn\n_s\nn\n))\nis satis able in S\nU\n.\nTo show (1 ! 3), we assume that the relativized term satis ability problem for S is\nde idable. Let S = (L;M) and S\nU\n= (L\nU\n;M\nU\n). In the following, we use f\nU\nas an\nabbreviation for f\n8U\nS\n. Sin e we an repla e equivalently in any term the fun tion symbol\nf\n9U\nS\nby :f\nU\n:, we may assume without loss of generality that f\n9U\nS\ndoes not o ur in terms\nof L\nU\n.\nSuppose a set = fa : sg [ from L\nU\nis given, where is a set of term assertions. We\nwant to de ide whether is satis able in some modelW 2M\nU\n. To this purpose, we trans-\nform into a set of assertions not ontaining f\nU\n. The idea underlying this transformation\nis that, given a modelW 2M\nU\n, we have f\nU\n(t)\nW\n2 fW; ;g, depending on whether t\nW\n=W\nor not. Consequently, if we repla e f\nU\n(t) a ordingly by > or ?, the evaluation of this term\nin W does not hange. However, in the satis ability test we do not have the model W (we are trying to de ide whether one exists), and thus we must guess the right repla ement.\nA term t from L\nU\nis alled a U -term i it starts with f\nU\n. The set of U -terms that\no ur (possibly as subterms) in is denoted by\nU\n. Set, indu tively, for any fun tion\n8. Note that it is not ne essary to add the universal role U to the set of relation symbols sin e an assertion\nof the form U(a; b) is trivially true. However, the use of the universal role within (quali ed) number restri tions is not overed by this extension.\n:\nU\n! f?;>g and all subterms of terms in :\nx\n:= x;\n(t\n1\n^ t\n2\n)\n:= t\n1\n^ t\n2\n;\n(t\n1\n_ t\n2\n)\n:= t\n1\n_ t\n2\n;\n(:t)\n:= :t ;\n(f(t\n1\n; : : : ; t\nn\n))\n:= f(t\n1\n; : : : ; t\nn\n) for f 6= f\nU\nof arity n;\n(f\nU\n(t))\n:= (f\nU\n(t)):\nThus, t is obtained from t by repla ing all o urren es of U -terms in t by their image under\n, i.e., by ? or >. De ne, for any su h fun tion ,\n:= ft\n1\nv t\n2\nj t\n1\nv t\n2\n2 g [ fa : s g [\nf> v t j f\nU\n(t) 2\nU\nand (f\nU\n(t)) = >g [\nfa\nt\n: :t j f\nU\n(t) 2\nU\nand (f\nU\n(t)) = ?g;\nwhere the a\nt\nare mutually distin t new obje t variables. Note that\ndoes not ontain the\nfun tion symbol f\nU\n, and thus it an be viewed as a set of assertions of S. In addition, though\nit ontains more than one membership assertion, it does not ontain assertions involving relation symbols. Consequently, the satis ability of in S an be he ked using the term satis ability test for S (see the proof of Corollary 22 above). De idability of the relativized term satis ability problem for S U then follows from the following laim:\nClaim. is satis able in a member of M\nU\ni there exists a mapping :\nU\n! f?;>g\nsu h that\nis satis able in a member of M.\nTo prove this laim, rst suppose that is satis ed under an assignment A in a member\nW = W;F\nW\n[ ff\nW U g;R W of M U . De ne by setting (f U (t)) = > if (f U (t)) W;A =\nW , and (f\nU\n(t)) = ? otherwise. Obviously, this implies that\nis satis ed under the\nassignment A in W;F\nW\n;R\nW\n, whi h is a member of M.\nConversely, suppose\nis satis able for some mapping . Take a member W =\nW;F\nW\n;R\nW\nof M and an assignment A su h su h that hW;Ai j=\n. Set W\n0\n:=\nW;F\nW\n[ ff\nW U g;R W , and prove, by indu tion, for all terms t that o ur in :\n( ) t\nW\n0\n;A\n= (t )\nW;A\n:\nThe only riti al ase is the one where t = f\nU\n(s). First, assume that (f\nU\n(s)) = (f\nU\n(s)) =\n>. Then\nontains > v s , and thus W = (s )\nW;A\n= s\nW\n0\n;A\n, where the se ond identity\nholds by indu tion. However, s\nW\n0\n;A\n=W implies (f\nU\n(s))\nW\n0\n;A\n=W = >\nW;A\n. The ase where\n(f\nU\n(s)) = (f\nU\n(s)) = ? an be treated similarly. Here the term assertion a\ns\n: :s ensures\nthat s (and thus by indu tion s) is not interpreted as the whole domain. Consequently, applying f\nU\nto it yields the empty set.\nSin e hW;Ai j=\n, the identity ( ) implies that hW\n0\n;Ai j= . This ompletes the proof\nof the laim, and thus also of the proposition. ❏\nFor normal modal logi s, the result stated in this proposition was already shown by Goranko and Passy (1992). The proof te hnique used there an, however, not be transfered\nto our more general situation sin e it strongly depends on the normality of the modal operators.\nUsing Proposition 24, we obtain the following orollary to our rst transfer theorem.\nCorollary 25. Let S\n1\n, S\n2\nbe lo al ADSs and assume that, for i 2 f1; 2g, the relativized\n(term) satis ability problem for S\ni\nis de idable. Then the relativized (term) satis ability\nproblem for S\nU 1 S U 2 is de idable.\nProof. We know by Theorem 17 (Corollary 22) that the relativized (term) satis ability problem for S\n1\nS\n2\nis de idable. Hen e, Proposition 24 yields that the relativized (term)\nsatis ability problem for (S\n1\nS\n2\n)\nU\nis de idable. But S\nU 1 S U 2 is just a notational variant\nof (S\n1\nS\n2\n)\nU\n: the fun tion symbols f\n9U\nS\n1\nand f\n9U\nS\n2\nan be repla ed by f\n9U\nS\n1\nS\n2\n(and\nanalogously for f\n8U\nS\n1\nS\n2\n) sin e all three have identi al semanti s. ❏\n4.2 Satis ability\nNote that Theorem 17 does not yield a transfer result for the unrelativized satis ability problem. Of ourse, if the relativized satis ability problems for S\n1\nand S\n2\nare de idable,\nthen the theorem implies that the satis ability problem for S\n1\nS\n2\nis also de idable (sin e\nit is a spe ial ase of the relativized satis ability problem). However, to be able to apply the theorem to obtain de idability of the satis ability problem in the fusion, the omponent ADSs must satisfy the stronger requirement that the relativized satis ability problem is de-\nidable. Indeed, the set\ni\nin Theorem 20 ontains a term assertion (namely > v sur\ni\n(\nW\nD))\neven if does not ontain any term assertions.\nThere are ases where the relativized satis ability problem is unde idable whereas the satis ability problem is still de idable. For example, Theorem 17 annot be applied for the fusion of ALCF and ALC +;Æ;t sin e the relativized satis ability problem for ALCF is already unde idable (Baader et al., 1993). However, the satis ability problem is de idable for both DLs.\n4.2.1 Covering normal terms\nBefore we an formulate a transfer result for the satis ability problem, we need to introdu e an additional notion, whi h generalizes the notion of a normal modal logi .\nDe nition 26 (Covering normal terms). Let (L;M) be an ADS and f be a fun tion symbol of L of arity n. The term t\nf\n(x) (with one variable x) is a overing normal term for\nf i the following holds for all W 2M:\nt\nW f (W ) =W\nfor all X;Y W , t\nW f (X \\ Y ) = t W f (X) \\ t W f (Y ); and\nfor all X;X\n1\n; : : : ; Y\nn\nW : X \\X\ni\n= X \\ Y\ni\nfor 1 i n implies\nt\nW f (X) \\ f W (X 1 ; : : : ;X n ) = t W f (X) \\ f W (Y 1 ; : : : ; Y n ):\nAn ADS (L;M) is said to have overing normal terms i one an e e tively determine a\novering normal term t\nf\nfor every fun tion symbol f of L.\nIntuitively, the rst two onditions state that the overing normal term behaves like a\nvalue restri tion (or box operator). Consider the term f\n8R\n(x), where f\n8R\nis the fun tion\nsymbol orresponding to the value restri tion onstru tor for the role R. Then f\n8R\n(x)\nobviously satis es the rst two requirements for overing normal terms. Note that the se ond ondition implies that the fun tion indu ed by t\nf\nis monotoni , i.e., X Y implies\nt\nW f (X) t W f (Y ). The third ondition spe i es the onne tion between the overing normal\nterm and the fun tion symbol it overs. With respe t to elements of t\nW f (X), the values\nof the fun tions f\nW\n(X\n1\n; : : : ;X\nn\n) and f\nW\n(Y\n1\n; : : : ; Y\nn\n) agree provided that their arguments\nagree on X. It is easy to see that f\n8R\n(x) is a overing normal term for the fun tion symbols\norresponding to the value, existential, and (quali ed) number restri tions on the role R\n(see Proposition 35 below).\nGiven overing normal terms t\nf\nfor the fun tion symbols f of a nite set of fun tion\nsymbols E, one an onstru t a term t\nE\nthat is a overing normal term for all the elements\nof E.\nLemma 27. Suppose the ADS (L;M) has overing normal terms and L is based on a set of fun tion symbols F . Denote by t\nf\nthe overing normal term for the fun tion symbol f ,\nfor all f 2 F . Then, for every nite set E F of fun tion symbols, the term\nt\nE\n(x) :=\n^\nf2E\nt\nf\n(x)\nis a overing normal term for all f 2 E.\n4.2.2 Corresponden e to normal modal logi s\nThe following result shows that any ADS in whi h every fun tion symbol is normal has\novering normal terms. Hen e, the notion of overing normal terms generalizes the notion\nof normality in modal logi s.\nProposition 28. Let (L;M) be an ADS, and assume that f is a normal fun tion symbol in (L;M). Then\nt\nf\n(x) := f(x;?; : : : ;?) ^ f(?; x; : : : ;?) ^ ^ f(?; : : : ;?; x)\nis a overing normal term for f . In parti ular, if f is nullary (unary), then t\nf\n(x) = >\n(t\nf\n(x) = f(x)) is a overing normal term for f .\nProof. The rst two onditions in the de nition of overing normal terms immediately follow from the de nition of normal fun tion symbols. Thus, we on entrate on the third\nondition. Assume, for simpli ity, that f is binary. SupposeW 2M andX;X\n1\n;X\n2\n; Y\n1\n; Y\n2\nW with X \\ X\ni\n= X \\ Y\ni\nfor i = 1; 2, and set F := f\nW\n. Then F (X \\ X\n1\n;X \\ X\n2\n) =\nF (X \\ Y\n1\n;X \\ Y\n2\n). Sin e F is normal, we know that\nF (X \\X\n1\n;X \\X\n2\n) = F (X;X) \\ F (X;X\n2\n) \\ F (X\n1\n;X) \\ F (X\n1\n;X\n2\n);\nF (X \\ Y\n1\n;X \\ Y\n2\n) = F (X;X) \\ F (X;Y\n2\n) \\ F (Y\n1\n;X) \\ F (Y\n1\n; Y\n2\n);\nand thus\nF (X;X) \\ F (X;X\n2\n) \\ F (X\n1\n;X) \\ F (X\n1\n;X\n2\n) =\nF (X;X) \\ F (X;Y\n2\n) \\ F (Y\n1\n;X) \\ F (Y\n1\n; Y\n2\n):\nSin e, by normality of F ,\nF (X;X) \\ F (X;X\n2\n) \\ F (X\n1\n;X) t\nW f (X);\nF (X;X) \\ F (X;Y\n2\n) \\ F (Y\n1\n;X) t\nW f (X);\nthis implies t\nW f (X) \\ F (X 1 ;X 2 ) = t W f (X) \\ F (Y 1 ; Y 2\n). ❏\n4.2.3 The transfer result\nUsing overing normal terms, we an now formulate the se ond transfer theorem, whi h is\non erned with the transfer of de idability of (non-relativized) satis ability.\nTheorem 29. Let S\n1\nand S\n2\nbe lo al ADSs having overing normal terms, and suppose\nthat the satis ability problems for S\n1\nand S\n2\nare de idable. Then the satis ability problem\nfor S\n1\nS\n2\nis also de idable.\nAs in the proof of Theorem 17, we x two lo al ADSs S\ni\n= (L\ni\n;M\ni\n), i 2 f1; 2g, in whi h\nL\n1\nis based on the set of fun tion symbols F and relation symbols R, and L\n2\nis based on G\nand Q. Let L = L\n1\nL\n2\nand M =M\n1\nM\n2\n.\nThe proof of Theorem 29 follows the same general ideas as the proof of Theorem 17.\nThere are, however, notable di eren es in the way satis ability in S\n1\nS\n2\nis redu ed to\nsatis ability in S\n1\nand S\n2\n. In Theorem 20 we had to \\guess\" a set D of types, and then\nbased on this set and some additional guesses, a pair of satis ability problems\n1\nand\n2\nin\nS\n1\nand S\n2\n, respe tively, was generated. In the proof of Theorem 29, we do not need to guess\nD. Instead, we an ompute the right set. However, this omputation requires us to solve additional satis ability problems in the fusion S\n1\nS\n2\n. Nevertheless, this yields a redu tion\nsin e the alternation depth (i.e., number of alternations between fun tion symbols of S\n1\nand S\n2\n) de reases when going from the input set to these additional mixed satis ability\nproblems.\nBefore we an des ribe this redu tion in more detail, we must introdu e some new\nnotation. In the ase of relativized satis ability, term assertions of the form > v sur\ni\n(\nW\nD)\nwere used to assert that all elements of the domain belong to sur\ni\n(\nW\nD). Now, we use\novering normal terms to \\propagate\" sur\ni\n(\nW\nD) into terms up to a ertain depth. For a\nset of fun tion symbols E, de ne the E-depth d\nE\n(t) of a term t indu tively:\nd\nE\n(x\ni\n) = 0\nd\nE\n(:t) = d\nE\n(t)\nd\nE\n(t\n1\n_ t\n2\n) = d\nE\n(t\n1\n^ t\n2\n) = maxfd\nE\n(t\n1\n); d\nE\n(t\n2\n)g\nd\nE\n(f(t\n1\n; : : : ; t\nn\n)) = maxfd\nE\n(t\n1\n); : : : ; d\nE\n(t\nn\n)g+ 1 if f 2 E\nd\nE\n(f(t\n1\n; : : : ; t\nn\n)) = maxfd\nE\n(t\n1\n); : : : ; d\nE\n(t\nn\n)g if f 62 E\nIf is a nite set of assertions, then\nd\nE\n( ) := maxfd\nE\n(t) j t 2 term( )g:\nPut, for a term t(x) with one variable x, t\n0\n(x) := x, t\nm+1\n(x) := t(t\nm\n(x)), t\n0\n(x) := x, and\nt\nm+1\n(x) := t\nm+1\n(x) ^ t\nm\n(x).\nWe are now in the position to formulate the result that redu es satis ability in the fusion\nof two lo al ADSs with overing normal terms to satis ability in the omponent ADSs.\nTheorem 30. Let S\ni\n= (L\ni\n;M\ni\n), i 2 f1; 2g, be two lo al ADSs having overing normal\nterms in whi h L\n1\nis based on the set of fun tion symbols F and relation symbols R, and\nL\n2\nis based on G and Q, and let L = L\n1\nL\n2\nand M = M\n1\nM\n2\n. Let be a nite set\nof obje t assertions from L. Put m := d\nF\n( ), r := d\nG\n( ), and let (x) (d(x)) be a overing\nnormal term for all fun tion symbols in that are in F (G).\nFor i 2 f1; 2g, denote by\ni\nthe set of all s 2 C\ni\n( ) su h that the term s is satis able in\n(L;M). Then the following three onditions are equivalent:\n1. is satis able in (L;M).\n2. There exist\nfor every t 2\n1\nan obje t variable a\nt\n62 obj( )\nfor every a 2 obj( ) a term t\na\n2\n1\nsu h that the union\n1\nof the following sets of obje t assertions is satis able in\n(L\n1\n;M\n1\n):\nfa\nt\n: sur\n1\n(t ^\nm\n(sur\n1\n(\nW\n1\n)) j t 2\n1\ng,\nfa : sur\n1\n(t\na\n^\nm\n(sur\n1\n(\nW\n1\n)) j a 2 obj( )g,\nfR(a; b) j R(a; b) 2 ; R 2 Rg,\nfa : sur\n1\n(s) j (a : s) 2 g;\nand the union\n2\nof the following sets of obje t assertions is satis able in (L\n2\n;M\n2\n):\nfa\nt\n: sur\n2\n(t ^ d\nr\n(sur\n2\n(\nW\n1\n)) j t 2\n1\ng,\nfa : sur\n2\n(t\na\n^ d\nr\n(sur\n2\n(\nW\n1\n)) j a 2 obj( )g,\nfQ(a; b) j Q(a; b) 2 ; Q 2 Qg.\n3. The same ondition as in (2) above, with\n1\nrepla ed by\n2\n.\nThe sets\ni\nin the above theorem are very similar to the ones in Theorem 20. The\nmain di eren e is that the term assertion > v sur\ni\n(\nW\nD) is no longer there. Instead,\nthe disjun tion sur\ni\n(\nW\n1\n) is dire tly \\inserted\" into the terms using the overing normals\nterms. As already mentioned above, another di eren e is that the set D, whi h had to be guessed in Theorem 20, is repla ed by the set\n1\nin (2) and\n2\nin (3). A tually, guessing the\nset D is no longer possible in this ase. In the proof of Theorem 30 we need to know that > v sur\ni\n(\nW\nD) is satis able in S\ni\n(i.e., holds in at least one model inM\ni\n). But we have no\nway to he k this e e tively sin e we do not have an algorithm for relativized satis ability\nin S\ni\n. Taking the set\ni\nensures that this property is satis ed (see the proof in the appendix\nfor details).\nBy de nition,\ni\nis the set of all s 2 C\ni\n( ) su h that the term s is satis able in (L;M).\nRe all that the term s is satis able i fa : sg is satis able in (L;M) for an arbitrary obje t variable a. Sin e the elements of C i ( ) are still mixed terms (i.e., terms of the fusion), omputing the set\ni\na tually needs a re ursive all to the de ision pro edure for\nsatis ability in (L;M). This re ursion is well-founded sin e the alternation depth de reases.\nDe nition 31. For a term s of L, denote by a\n1\n(s) and a\n2\n(s) the 1-alternation and the\n2-alternation depth of s, respe tively. That is to say, a\n1\n(s) is the length of the longest\nsequen e of the form (g\n1\n; f\n2\n; g\n3\n; : : :) su h that\ng\n1\n(: : : (f\n2\n: : : (g\n3\n: : :)))\nwith g\nj\n2 G and f\nj\n2 F appears in s. The 2-alternation depth a\n2\n(s) is de ned by ex hanging\nthe roles of F and G. Put a(s) := a\n1\n(s) + a\n2\n(s), and all this the alternation depth. For a\nnite set of terms, a( ) is the maximum of all a(s) with s 2 .\nThus, a\n1\n(s) ounts the maximal number of hanges between symbols from the rst and\nthe se ond ADS, starting with the rst symbol from S\n2\n(i.e., the rst symbol from S\n2\nounts as a hange, even if it does not o ur inside the s ope of a symbol from S\n2\n). The\n2-alternation depth is de ned a ordingly. The alternation depth sums up the 1- and the 2-alternation depth.\nLemma 32. If a(term( )) > 0, then a(C\n1\n( )) < a(term( )) or a(C\n2\n( )) < a(term( )).\nProof. We show that, if a(term( )) > 0, then we have a(sub\n1\n( )) < a(term( )) or\na(sub\n2\n( )) < a(term( )), whi h, by de nition of C\ni\n, learly implies the lemma. First\nnote that, by de nition of sub\ni\n, we have\na\ni\n(sub\nj\n( )) a\ni\n(term( )) for all i; j: ( )\nWe now make a ase distin tion as follows:\n1. a\n1\n(term( )) a\n2\n(term( )). We want to show that a\n1\n(sub\n2\n( )) < a\n1\n(term( )),\nsin e, by ( ), this implies a(sub\n2\n( )) < a(term( )). Assume to the ontrary that\na\n1\n(sub\n2\n( )) a\n1\n(term( )). Then ( ) implies a\n1\n(sub\n2\n( )) = a\n1\n(term( )). Hen e,\nthere exists a term s 2 sub\n2\n( ) and a sequen e (g\n1\n; f\n2\n; g\n3\n; : : : ) of fun tion symbols\ng\ni\n2 G; f\ni\n2 F of length a\n1\n(term( )) su h that g\n1\n(: : : (f\n2\n: : : (g\n3\n: : :))) o urs in s. By\nde nition of sub\n2\n, this implies the existen e of a term t 2 term( ) and a fun tion\nsymbol f 2 F su h that f(: : : g\n1\n(: : : (f\n2\n: : : (g\n3\n: : :)))) o urs in t. Sin e the length of\n(g\n1\n; f\n2\n; g\n3\n; : : : ) is a\n1\n(term( )), this obviously yields a\n2\n(term( )) > a\n1\n(term( )) whi h\nis a ontradi tion.\n2. a\n1\n(term( )) a\n2\n(term( )). Similar to the previous ase: just ex hange the roles of\na\n1\nand a\n2\n, F and G, and sub\n1\nand sub\n2\n.\n❏\nTo prove Theorem 29, we must show how Theorem 30 an be used to onstru t a de ision\npro edure for satis ability in S\n1\nS\n2\nfrom su h de ision pro edures for the omponent\nsystems S\n1\nand S\n2\n. Let us rst onsider the problem of omputing the sets\n1\nand\n2\n.\nIf a((term( )) = 0, then onsists of Boolean ombinations of set variables. In this\nase, C\ni\n( ) onsists of set variables, and\ni\n; i = 1; 2, an be omputed using Boolean\nreasoning. If a(term( )) > 0, then Lemma 32 states that there is an i 2 f1; 2g su h that a(C i ( )) < a(term( )). By indu tion we an thus assume that\ni\nan e e tively be\nomputed. Consequently, it remains to he k Condition (i+1) of Theorem 30 for i 2 f1; 2g.\nSin e\ni\nis nite, we an guess for every obje t variable a o urring in a type t\na\nin\ni\n. The\nsets\n1\nand\n2\nobtained this way are indeed sets of assertions of L\n1\nand L\n2\n, respe tively.\nThus, their satis ability an e e tively be he ked using the de ision pro edures for S\n1\nand\nS\n2\n. This proves Theorem 29.\nThe argument used above also shows why in Theorem 30 it was not suÆ ient to state equivalen e of (1) and (2) (as in Theorem 20). In fa t, the indu tion argument used above does not ne essarily always apply to the omputation of\n1\n. In some ases, the alternation\ndepth may not de reases for\n1\n, but only for\n2\n. It should be noted that Theorem 20 ould\nalso have been formulated in this symmetri way. We have not done this sin e it was not ne essary for proving Theorem 17.\nRegarding the omplexity of the ombined de ision pro edure, we must in prin iple also onsider the omplexity of omputing overing normal terms and the size of these terms. In the examples from DL, these terms are just value restri tions, and thus their size and the omplexity of omputing them is linear. Here, we assume a polynomial bound on both. Under this assumption, we obtain the same omplexity results as for the ase of relativized satis ability. In fa t, the omplexity of testing Condition (2) and (3) of Theorem 30 agrees with the omplexity of testing Condition (2) of Theorem 20: it adds one exponential to the\nomplexity of the de ision pro edure for the single ADSs. In order to ompute\ni\n, we need\nexponentially many re ursive alls to the pro edure. Sin e the re ursion depth is linear in the size of , we end up with at most exponentially many tests of Condition (2) and (3).\nCorollary 33. Let S\n1\nand S\n2\nbe lo al ADSs having overing normal terms, and assume\nthat these overing normal terms an be omputed in polynomial time. If the satis ability problems for S\n1\nand S\n2\nare de idable in ExpTime (PSpa e), then the satis ability problem\nfor S\n1\nS\n2\nis de idable in 2ExpTime (ExpSpa e).\nWith the same argument as in the ase of relativized satis ability, we an extend the\ntransfer result also to term satis ability.\nCorollary 34. Let S\n1\nand S\n2\nbe lo al ADSs having overing normal terms, and suppose\nthat the term satis ability problems for S\n1\nand S\n2\nare de idable. Then the term satis ability\nproblem for S\n1\nS\n2\nis also de idable.\n5. Fusions of des ription logi s\nGiven two DLs L\n1\nand L\n2\n, their fusion is de ned as follows. We translate them into the\norresponding ADSs S\n1\nand S\n2\n, and then build the fusion S\n1\nS\n2\n. The fusion L\n1\nL\n2\nof L\n1\nand L\n2\nis the DL that orresponds to S\n1\nS\n2\n. Sin e the de nition of the fusion of\nADSs requires their sets of fun tion symbols to be disjoint, we must ensure that the ADSs\norresponding to L\n1\nand L\n2\nare built over disjoint sets of fun tion symbols. For the DLs\nintrodu ed in Se tion 2, this an be a hieved by assuming that the sets of role names of L\n1\nand L\n2\nare disjoint and the sets of nominals of L\n1\nand L\n2\nare disjoint. The DL L\n1\nL\n2\nthen\nallows the use of the on ept and role onstru tors of both DLs, but in a restri ted way. Role des riptions are either role des riptions of L\n1\nor of L\n2\n. There are no role des riptions\ninvolving onstru tors or names of both DLs. Con ept des riptions may ontain on ept\nonstru tors of both DLs; however, a onstru tor of L\ni\nmay only use a role des ription of\nL\ni\n(i = 1; 2).\nLet us illustrate these restri tions by two simple examples. The fusion ALC\n+\nALC\n1\nof the two DLs ALC\n+\nand ALC\n1\nis the fragment of ALC\n+; 1\nwhose set of role names is\npartitioned into two sets N\nR\n1\nand N\nR\n2\nsu h that\nthe transitive losure operator may only be applied to names from N\nR\n1\n;\nthe inverse operator may only be applied to names from N\nR\n2\n.\nFor example, if A is a on ept name, R 2 N\nR\n1\nand Q 2 N\nR\n2\n, then 9R\n+\n:A u 8Q\n1\n::A is\na on ept des ription of ALC\n+\nALC\n1\n, but 9R\n+\n:A u 8R\n1\n::A and 9(Q\n1\n)\n+\n:A are not.\nNote that, although the two sour e DLs have disjoint sets of role names, in ALC\n+\nALC\n1\nrole names from both sets may be used inside existential and value restri tions sin e these\non ept onstru tors are available in both DLs.\nThe fusion ALCQ ALC\nR\n+ of the two DLs ALCQ and ALC\nR\n+ is the fragment of\nALCQ\nR\n+ whose set of role names N\nR\n(with transitive roles N\nR\n+ N\nR\n) is partitioned into\ntwo sets N\nR\n1\nand N\nR\n2\nwith N\nR\n+ N\nR\n2\nsu h that, inside qualifying number restri tions,\nonly role names from N\nR\n1\nmay be used. In parti ular, this means that transitive roles\nannot o ur within quali ed number restri tions.\nIn the following, we give examples that illustrate the usefulness of the transfer results proved in the previous se tion. First, we will give an example for the ase of satis ability and then for relativized satis ability. Subsequently, we will onsider a more omplex example involving so- alled on rete domains. Here, our general transfer result an be used to prove a de idability result that has only re ently been proved by designing a spe ialized algorithm for the fusion. Finally, we will give an example that demonstrates that the restri tion to lo al ADSs is really ne essary.\n5.1 De idability transfer for satis ability\nIn this subse tion, we will give an example for an appli ation of Theorem 29 where the de idability result ould not be obtained using Theorem 17.\nTheorem 29 requires the ADSs to have overing normal terms. This is, however, satis ed\nby all the DLs that yield lo al ADSs.\nProposition 35. Let L be one of the DLs introdu ed in Se tion 2, and let the orresponding ADS S = (L;M) be lo al. Then S has overing normal terms, and these terms an be\nomputed in linear time.\nProof. For all fun tion symbols f in L, the term t\nf\nhas the form f\n8R\n(x) for some role\ndes ription R. The semanti s of value restri tions implies that terms of this form satisfy\nthe rst two properties of De nition 26. This ompletes the proof for all fun tion symbols f of arity 0 sin e for these the third ondition of De nition 26 is trivially satis ed. Thus, for nullary fun tion symbols, f\n8R\n(x) for an arbitrary role name R does the job.\nIt remains to show that, for every unary fun tion symbol f 2 ff\n9R\n; f\n8R\n; f\n_\nnR\n; f\n_\nnR\ng,\nthe term f\n8R\n(x) also satis es the third property. This is an immediate onsequen e of the\nfa t that, for these fun tion symbols f , we have f\nW 8R (X) \\ f W (Y ) = f W 8R (X) \\ f W (X \\ Y )\nfor all models W 2M and X;Y W . ❏\nIn the following, we onsider the two des ription logi s ALCF and ALC\n+;Æ;t\n. Hollunder\nand Nutt (1990) show that satis ability of ALCF - on ept des riptions is de idable. The same is true for onsisten y of ALCF -ABoxes (Lutz, 1999). Note, however, that relativized satis ability of ALCF - on ept des riptions and thus also relativized ABox onsisten y in ALCF is unde idable (Baader et al., 1993). For ALC +;Æ;t , de idability of satis ability is shown by Baader (1991) and S hild (1991). 9 De idability of ABox onsisten y in ALC +;Æ;t is shown in Chapter 7 of (De Gia omo, 1995).\nThe unrestri ted ombinationALCF\n+;Æ;t\nof the two DLs is unde idable. To be more pre-\nise, satis ability ofALCF\n+;Æ;t\n- on ept des riptions (and thus also onsisten y ofALCF\n+;Æ;t\n-\nABoxes) is unde idable. This follows from the unde idability of relativized satis ability of ALCF - on ept des riptions and the fa t that the role operators in ALCF +;Æ;t an be used to internalize TBoxes (S hild, 1991; Baader et al., 1993). In ontrast to the unde idability of ALCF +;Æ;t , Theorem 29 immediately implies that satis ability of on ept des riptions in the fusion of ALCF and ALC +;Æ;t is de idable.\nTheorem 36. Satis ability of on ept des riptions and onsisten y of ABoxes is de idable in ALCF ALC +;Æ;t , whereas satis ability of ALCF +;Æ;t - on ept des riptions is already unde idable.\nTaking the fusion thus yields a de idable ombination of two DLs whose unrestri ted ombination is unde idable. The pri e one has to pay is that the fusion o ers less expres-\nsivity than the unrestri ted ombination. The on ept f\n1\n#f\n2\nu 8f\n+ 1 :C is an example of a\non ept des ription of ALCF\n+;Æ;t\nthat is not allowed in the fusion ALCF ALC\n+;Æ;t\n.\n5.2 De idability transfer for relativized satis ability\nAs an example for the appli ation of Corollary 22 (and thus of Theorem 17), we onsider the DL ALC +;Æ;u;t\nf\n. For this DL, satis ability of on ept des riptions is unde idable. However,\nan expressive fragment with a de idable relativized satis ability problem an be obtained by building the fusion of the two sublanguages ALC +;Æ;t\nf\nand ALC\n+;Æ;t;u\n.\nTheorem 37. Satis ability of ALC\n+;Æ;u;t f - on ept des riptions is unde idable.\nUnde idability an be shown by a redu tion of the domino problem (Berger, 1966; Knuth, 1973) (see, e.g., Baader & Sattler, 1999, for unde idability proofs of DLs using su h a redu tion). The main tasks to solve in su h a redu tion is that one an express the N N grid and that one an a ess all points on the grid. One square of the grid an be expressed\n9. Note that ALC\n+;Æ;t\nis a notational variant of test-free propositional dynami logi (PDL) (Fis her &\nLadner, 1979).\nby a des ription of the form 9(xÆyuyÆx):>, where x; y are features. In fa t, this des ription expresses that the \\points\" belonging to it have both an x Æ y and a y Æ x su essor, and that these two su essors oin ide. A essing all point on the grid an then be a hieved by using the role des ription (x t y) + .\nNote that this unde idability result is also losely related to the known unde idability of IDPDL, i.e., deterministi propositional dynami logi with interse tion (Harel, 1984). However, the unde idability proof for IDPDL by Harel (1984) uses the test onstru t, whi h is not available in ALC +;Æ;u;t\nf\n.\nNext, we show that relativized satis ability in two rather expressive sublanguages of\nALC\n+;Æ;u;t f is de idable.\nTheorem 38. Relativized satis ability of on ept des riptions is de idable in ALC\n+;Æ;t f and\nALC\n+;Æ;t;u\n.\nProof sket h. In both ases, TBoxes an be internalized as des ribed by S hild (1991) and Baader et al. (1993). Thus, it is suÆ ient to show de idability of (unrelativized) satis ability.\nFor ALC\n+;Æ;t f , this follows from de idability of DPDL (Ben-Ari, Halpern, & Pnueli,\n1982), the known orresponden e between PDL and ALC\n+;Æ;t\n(S hild, 1991), and the fa t\nthat non-fun tional roles an be simulated by fun tional ones in the presen e of omposition and transitive losure (Parikh, 1980).\nFor ALC\n+;Æ;t;u\n, de idability of satis ability follows from de idability of IPDL, i.e., PDL\nwith interse tion (Dane ki, 1984). ❏\nGiven this theorem, Corollary 22 now yields the following de idability result.\nCorollary 39. Relativized satis ability of on ept des riptions is de idable in the fusion ALC +;Æ;t\nf\nALC\n+;Æ;t;u\n.\n5.3 A \\ on rete\" example\nDes ription logi s with on rete domains were introdu ed by Baader and Hans hke (1991) in order to allow for the referen e to on rete obje ts like numbers, time intervals, spatial regions, et . when de ning on epts. To be more pre ise, Baader and Hans hke (1991) de ne the extension ALC(D) of ALC, where D is a on rete domain (see below). Under suitable assumptions on D, they show that satis ability in ALC(D) is de idable. One of the main problems with this extension of DLs is that relativized satis ability (and satis ability in DLs where TBoxes an be internalized) is usually unde idable (Baader & Hans hke, 1992) (though there are ex eptions, see Lutz, 2001). For this reason, Haarslev et al. (2001) introdu e a restri ted way of extending DLs by on rete domains, and show that the orresponding extension of ALCN\nHR\n+ has a de idable relativized satis ability problem.\n10\nIn\nthe following, we show that this result an also be obtained as an easy onsequen e of\n10. To be more pre ise, they even show that relativized ABox onsisten y is de idable in their restri ted\nextension of ALCN\nHR\n+\nby on rete domains. Here, we restri t ourself to satis ability of on epts\nsin e the ABoxes introdu ed by Haarslev et al. (2001) also allow for the use of on rete individuals and for predi ate assertions on these individuals, whi h is not overed by the obje t assertions for ADSs introdu ed in the present paper.\nour Theorem 17. Moreover, ALCN\nHR\n+ an be repla ed by an arbitrary lo al DL with a\nde idable relativized satis ability problem.\nDe nition 40 (Con rete Domain). A on rete domain D is a pair (\nD\n;\nD\n), where\nD\nis a nonempty set alled the domain, and\nD\nis a set of predi ate names. Ea h predi ate\nname P 2\nD\nis asso iated with an arity n and an n-ary predi ate P\nD\nn D . A on rete\ndomain D is alled admissible i (1) the set of its predi ate names is losed under negation and ontains a name >\nD\nfor\nD\n, and (2) the satis ability problem for nite onjun tions\nof predi ates is de idable.\nGiven a on rete domain D and one of the predi ates P 2\nD\n(of arity n), one an\nde ne a new on ept onstru tor 9f\n1\n; : : : ; f\nn\n:P (predi ate restri tion), where f\n1\n; : : : ; f\nn\nare\non rete features.\n11\nIn ontrast to the abstra t features onsidered until now, on rete\nfeatures are interpreted by partial fun tions from the abstra t domain\nI\ninto the on rete\ndomain\nD\n. We onsider the basi DL that allows for Boolean operators and these new\non ept onstru tors only.\nDe nition 41 (B(D)). Let N\nC\nbe a set of on ept names and N\nF\nbe a set of names for\non rete features disjoint from N\nC\n, and let D be an admissible on rete domain. Con epts\ndes riptions of B(D) are Boolean ombinations of on ept names and predi ate restri - tions, i.e., expressions of the form 9f\n1\n; : : : ; f\nn\n:P where P is an n-ary predi ate in\nD\nand\nf\n1\n; : : : ; f\nn\n2 N\nF\n.\nThe semanti s of B(D) is de ned as follows. We onsider an interpretation I, whi h\nhas a nonempty domain\nI\n, and interprets on ept names as subsets of\nI\nand on rete\nfeatures as partial fun tions from\nI\ninto\nD\n. The Boolean operators are interpreted as\nusual, and\n(9f\n1\n; : : : ; f\nn\n:P )\nI\n= fa 2\nI\nj 9x\n1\n; : : : ; x\nn\n2\nD\n:\nf\nI i (a) = x i for all 1 i n and (x 1 ; : : : ; x n ) 2 P D g:\nNote that on ept des riptions are interpreted as subsets of\nI\nand not of\nI\n[\nD\n.\nThus, if we go to the ADS orresponding to B(D), the on rete domain is not an expli it part of the orresponding ADMs. It is only used to de ne the interpretation of the fun tion symbols orresponding to predi ate restri tions. The predi ate restri tion onstru tor is translated into a fun tion symbol f\n9f\n1\n;:::;f\nn\n:P\nof arity 0, and, for an ADM W orresponding\nto a frame F, f\nW 9f\n1\n;:::;f\nn\n:P\nis de ned as (9f\n1\n; : : : ; f\nn\n:P )\nI\n;\n, where I\n;\nis the interpretation based\non F that maps all on ept names to the empty set.\nTheorem 42. Let D be an admissible on rete domain. Then, B(D) is lo al and the relativized satis ability problem for B(D)- on ept des riptions is de idable.\nProof. Given the family (W\ni\n)\ni2I\nof ADMsW\ni\norresponding to the frames F\ni\nover pairwise\ndisjoint domains\nF\ni\n(i 2 I), we rst build the union F of the frames: the domain of F is\nS\ni2I\nF\ni\nand it interprets the on rete features in the obvious way, i.e., f\nF\n(x) := f\nF\ni\n(x) if\n11. Note that the general framework introdu ed by Baader and Hans hke (1991) allows for feature hains in\npredi ate restri tions. Considering only feature hains of length one is the main restri tion introdu ed by Haarslev et al. (2001).\nx 2\nF\ni\n. LetW be the ADM indu ed by F. To prove thatW is in fa t the disjoint union of\n(W\ni\n)\ni2I\n, it remains to show that f\nW 9f\n1\n;:::;f\nn\n:P\n=\nS\ni2I\nf\nW\ni\n9f\n1\n;:::;f\nn\n:P\n. This is an easy onsequen e\nof the semanti s of the predi ate restri tion onstru tor, the interpretation of the on rete features in F, and the fa t that the domains F i are pairwise disjoint.\nDe idability of the unrelativized satis ability problem is an immediate onsequen e of the de idability results for ALC(D) given by Baader and Hans hke (1991). Sin e B(D) is a very simple DL that does not ontain any on ept onstru tors requiring the generation of abstra t individuals, it is easy to see that a B(D)- on ept des riptionC\n0\nis satis able relative\nto the TBox C\n1\nv D\n1\n; : : : ; C\nn\nv D\nn\ni it is satis able in a one-element interpretation. But\nthen the TBox an be internalized in a very simple way: C\n0\nis satis able relative to the\nTBox C\n1\nv D\n1\n; : : : ; C\nn\nv D\nn\ni C\n0\nu (:C\n1\ntD\n1\n) u : : : u (:C\nn\ntD\nn\n) is satis able. ❏\nGiven this theorem, Corollary 22 now yields the following transfer result, whi h shows that on rete domains with the restri ted form of predi ate restri tions introdu ed above an be integrated into any lo al DL with a de idable relativized satis ability problem without losing de idability.\nCorollary 43. Let D be an admissible on rete domain and L be a lo al DL for whi h relativized satis ability of on ept des riptions is de idable. Then, relativized satis ability of on ept des riptions in B(D) L is also de idable.\n5.4 Non-lo al DLs\nBy Proposition 15, DLs allowing for nominals, the universal role, or role negation are not lo al. It follows that the de idability transfer theorems are not appli able to fusions of su h DLs. In the following, we try to larify the reasons for this restri ted appli ability of the theorems.\nFirst, we show that there are DLs with de idable satis ability problem su h that their fusion has an unde idable satis ability problem. The ulprit in this ase is the universal role (or role negation).\nTheorem 44. Satis ability of on ept des riptions is de idable in ALC\nU\nand ALCF, but\nunde idable in their fusion ALC\nU\nALCF.\nProof. De idability of ALCF was shown by Hollunder and Nutt (1990) and of ALC\nU\nby\nBaader et al. (1990) and Goranko and Passy (1992). Unde idability of ALC\nU\nALCF\n(whi h is identi al to ALCF\nU\n) follows from the results by Baader et al. (1993) and the fa t\nthat the universal role an be used to simulate TBoxes (see Proposition 24). ❏\nNote that role negation an be used to simulate the universal role: just repla e 8U:C\nby 8R:C u 8R:C and 9U:C by 9R:C t 9R:C. In addition, de idability of ALC is known to be de idable (Lutz & Sattler, 2000). Consequently, the theorem also holds if we repla e ALC U by ALC .\nIt should be noted that the example given in the above theorem depends on the fa t that one of the two DLs allows for the universal role and the other be omes unde idable if the universal role is added. In fa t, Corollary 25 shows that de idability does transfer if both DLs already provide for the universal role.\nCon erning nominals, we do not have a ounterexample to the transfer of de idability in their presen e. However, we think that it is very unlikely that there an be a general transfer result in this ase. In fa t, note that for ea h DL L without nominals introdu ed in Se tion 2, its fusion withALCO is identi al to L extended with nominals. Sin e (relativized) satis ability in ALCO is de idable, a general transfer result in this ase would imply that this extension is de idable provided that L is de idable. Consequently, this would yield a general transfer result for adding nominals.\n6. Con lusion\nRegarding related work, the work that is most losely related to the one presented here is (Wolter, 1998). There, analogs of our Theorems 20 and 30 are proved for normal modal logi s within an algebrai framework. The present results extend the ones from Wolter (1998) in two dire tions. First, we have added obje t assertions, and thus an also prove transfer results for ABox reasoning. Se ond, we an show transfer results for satis ability in non-normal modal logi s as long as we have overing normal terms. This allows us to handle non-normal on ept onstru tors like quali ed number restri tions (graded modalities) in our framework.\nWe also think that the introdu tion of abstra t des ription systems (ADSs) is a ontribution in its own right. ADSs abstra t from the internal stru ture of on ept onstru tors and thus allow us to treat a vast range of su h onstru tors in a uniform way. Nevertheless, the model theoreti semanti s provided by ADSs is less abstra t than the algebrai semanti s employed by Wolter (1998). It is loser to the usual semanti s of DLs, and thus easier to omprehend for people used to this semanti s. The results in this paper show that ADSs in fa t yield a good level of abstra tion for proving general results on des ription logi s. Re ently, the same notion has been used for proving general results about so- alled E- onne tions of representation formalisms like des ription logi s, modal spatial logi s, and temporal logi s (Kutz, Wolter, & Zakharyas hev, 2001). In ontrast to fusions, in an E- onne tion the two domains are not merged but onne ted by means of relations.\nRegarding omplexity, our transfer results yield only upper bounds. Basi ally, they show that the omplexity of the algorithm for the fusion is at most one exponent higher than of the ones for the omponents. We believe that the omplexity of satis ability in the fusion of ADSs an indeed be exponentially higher than the omplexity of satis ability in the omponent ADSs. However, we do not yet have mat hing lower bounds, i.e., we know of no example where this exponential in rease in the omplexity really happens.\nNote that Spaan's results (1993) on the transfer of NP and PSpa e de idability from the omponent modal logi s to their fusion are restri ted to normal modal logi s, and that they make additional assumptions on the algorithms used to solve the satis ability problem in the omponent logi s. Nevertheless, for many PSpa e- omplete des ription logi s it is easy to see that their fusion is also PSpa e- omplete. In this sense, the general te hniques for reasoning in the fusion of des riptions logi s developed in this paper give only a rough\nomplexity estimate.\nAppendix A. Proofs\nIn this appendix, we give detailed proofs of riteria for (relativized) satis ability in the fusion of lo al ADSs. Re all that, from these riteria, the transfer theorems for de idability easily follow. We have deferred the proofs of these theorems to the appendix sin e they are rather te hni al.\nA.1 Proof of Theorem 20\nBefore we an prove this theorem, we need a te hni al lemma. In the proof of Theorem 20, we are going to merge models W\n1\n2 M\n1\nand W\n2\n2 M\n2\nby means of a bije tive fun tion b\nfrom the domain W\n1\nof W\n1\nonto the domain W\n2\nof W\n2\nin su h a way that the surrogates\nsur\ni\n(t), t 2 C\n1\n( ), are respe ted by b in the sense that\nw 2 sur\n1\n(t)\nW\n1\n;A\n1\n, b(w) 2 sur\n2\n(t)\nW\n2\n;A\n2\nfor all w 2 W\n1\nand t 2 C\n1\n( ). The existen e of su h a bije tion is equivalent to the ondi-\ntion that the ardinalities jsur\n1\n(t)\nW\n1\n;A\n1\nj of sur\n1\n(t)\nW\n1\n;A\n1\nand jsur\n2\n(t)\nW\n2\n;A\n2\nj of sur\n2\n(t)\nW\n2\n;A\n2\noin ide for all t 2 C\n1\n( ): if t 6= t\n0\nfor t; t\n0\n2 C\n1\n( ), then t ontains a onjun t whi h is\n(equivalent to) the negation of a onjun t of t\n0\n; hen e, for all su h t; t\n0\n, we have sur\ni\n(t)\nW\ni\n;A\ni\n\\\nsur\ni\n(t\n0\n)\nW\ni\n;A\ni\n= ; for i 2 f1; 2g, whi h learly yields the above equivalen e. The following\nlemma will be used to hoose models in su h a way that this ardinality ondition is satis ed. (We refer the reader to, e.g., Gr atzer, 1979 for information about ardinals.)\nLemma 45. Let (L;M) be a lo al ADS and a set of assertions satis able in (L;M). Then there exists a ardinal su h that, for all ardinals 0 , there exists a model W = W;F W ;R W 2 M with jW j = 0 and an assignment A with hW;Ai j= and js W;A j 2 f0; 0 g for all terms s.\nProof. By assumption, there exists an ADM W\n0\n= W\n0\n;F\nW\n0\n;R\nW\n0\n2 M and an as-\nsignment B = hB\n1\n;B\n2\ni in it su h that hW\n0\n;Bi j= . Let = maxf\n0\n; jW\n0\njg. We\nshow that is as required. Let\n0\n. Take\n0\ndisjoint isomorphi opies hW ;B\n1\ni,\nW = W ;F\nW\n;R\nW\n, <\n0\n, of hW\n0\n;B\n1\ni. (The rst member of the list oin ides\nwith W\n0\n.) Let W = W;F\nW\n;R\nW\nbe the disjoint union of the W , <\n0\n, and de ne\nhW;A = hA\n1\n;A\n2\nii by putting A\n2\n(a) = B\n2\n(a), for all a 2 X , and\nA\n1\n(x) =\n[\n<\n0\nB\n1\n(x);\nfor all x 2 V . Note that all obje t variables are interpreted in W\n0\n. It follows from the\nde nitions of term semanti s and disjoint unions that\ns\nW;A\n=\n[\n<\n0\ns\nW ;B\n; ( )\nfor all terms s. Hen e jW j =\n0\nand hW;Ai j= . It remains to show that js\nW;A\nj 2 f0;\n0\ng\nfor every term s. Suppose js\nW;A\nj 6= 0. Then, by ( ),\n0\njs\nW;A\nj\n0\n=\n0\n, whi h means\n0\n= js\nW;A j. ❏\nAs noted above, the disjointness of the sets sur\ni\n(t)\nW\ni\n;A\ni\nand sur\ni\n(t\n0\n)\nW\ni\n;A\ni\n(for t 6= t\n0\n)\nis required in order to ensure the existen e of the bije tion b. More pre isely, in order to merge modelsW\n1\n;W\n2\n, the sets sur\ni\n(t)\nW\ni\n;A\ni\nfor t member of some \\relevant\" subset of C\n1\n( )\nmust form a partition of W\ni\n's domain that satis es a ertain ardinality ondition. This is\nformalized by the following de nition:\nDe nition 46. Let be a ardinal. A set fX\n1\n; : : : ;X\nn\ng is alled a -partition of a set W\ni\n1. jX\ni\nj = , for all 1 i n,\n2. X\ni\n\\X\nj\n= ; whenever i 6= j, and\n3. W =\nS\n1 i n\nX\ni\n.\nfX\n1\n; : : : ;X\nn\ng is a -partition of an ADM W with domain W i it is a -partition of W .\nIn the proof, we will enfor e that Properties 1 and 3 hold by appropriate onstru tions,\nwhile Property 2 holds by de nition of C\n1\n( ).\nBefore proving Theorem 20, we repeat its formulation.\nTheorem 20. Let S\ni\n= (L\ni\n;M\ni\n), i 2 f1; 2g, be two lo al ADSs in whi h L\n1\nis based on\nthe set of fun tion symbols F and relation symbols R, and L\n2\nis based on G and Q, and\nlet L = L\n1\nL\n2\nand M = M\n1\nM\n2\n.

Let\nA = A\n1\n. To prove the impli ation from (2) to (1) of the theorem it remains to show that\nhW;Ai j= . To this end it suÆ es to prove the following laim:\nClaim. For all terms t 2 sub\n1\n( ), we have\nt\nW;A\n= sur\n1\n(t)\nW\n1\n;A\n1\n= b\n1\n(sur\n2\n(t)\nW\n2\n;A\n2\n):\nBefore we prove this laim, let us show that it implies hW;Ai j= . First note that, from the laim, we obtain\nt\nW;A\n= sur\n1\n(t)\nW\n1\n;A\n1\nfor all t 2 term( ): (1)\nThis may be proved by indu tion on the onstru tion of t 2 term( ) from terms in sub\n1\n( )\nusing the booleans and fun tion symbols from L\n1\n, only. The basis of indu tion (i.e., the\nequality for members of sub\n1\n( )) is stated in the laim and the indu tion step is straight-\nforward.\nWe now show that hW;Ai j= is a onsequen e of (1). Suppose R(a; b) 2 . Then\nR(a; b) 2\n1\nand thus hW;Ai j= R(a; b). Similarly, Q(a; b) 2 implies Q(a; b) 2\n2\nand\nhW;Ai j= Q(a; b). Suppose (a : t) 2 . Then (a : sur\n1\n(t)) 2\n1\nand so A\n1 2 (a) 2 sur 1 (t) W 1 ;A\n1\nwhi h implies, by (1), A\n1 2 (a) 2 t W;A . Hen e hW;Ai j= (a : t). If t 1 v t 2 2 , then\nsur\n1\n(t\n1\n) v sur\n1\n(t\n2\n) 2\n1\nand so, by (1), t\nW;A 1\nt\nW;A 2 . Hen e hW;Ai j= t 1 v t 2 .\nWe ome to the proof of the laim. It is proved by indu tion on the stru ture of t.\nDue to the following equalities holding for all t 2 sub\n1\n( ), it suÆ es to show that t\nW;A\n=\nsur\n1\n(t)\nW\n1\n;A\n1\n.\nsur\n1\n(t)\nW\n1\n;A\n1\n=\n[\nfsur\n1\n(s)\nW\n1\n;A\n1\n: s 2 D; t is a onjun t of sg\n=\n[\nfb\n1\n(sur\n2\n(s)\nW\n2\n;A\n2\n) : s 2 D; t is a onjun t of sg\n= b\n1\n(sur\n2\n(t)\nW\n2\n;A\n2\n)\nThe rst equality holds sin e sur\n1\n(\nW\nD)\nW\n1\n;A\n1\n= W\n1\nand, for all s 2 D, either t or :t\nis a onjun t of s. The se ond equality is true by de nition of b and the validity of the third equality an be seen analogously to the validity of the rst one by onsidering that sur\n2\n(\nW\nD)\nW\n2\n;A\n2\n=W\n2\n.\nHen e let us show t\nW;A\n= sur\n1\n(t)\nW\n1\n;A\n1\n. For the indu tion start, let t be a variable. The\nequation t\nW;A\n= sur\n1\n(t)\nW\n1\n;A\n1\nis an immediate onsequen e of the fa t that A = A\n1\n. For\nthe indu tion step, we distinguish several ases:\nt = :t\n1\n. By indu tion hypothesis, t\nW;A 1 = sur 1 (t 1 ) W 1 ;A 1 . Hen e, t W;A = W n t W;A 1 =\nW n sur\n1\n(t\n1\n)\nW\n1\n;A\n1\n= sur\n1\n(t)\nW\n1\n;A\n1\n(sin e W =W\n1\n).\nt = t\n1\n^ t\n2\n. By indu tion hypothesis, t\nW;A i = sur 1 (t i ) W 1 ;A 1 for i 2 f1; 2g. Hen e,\nt\nW;A\n= t\nW;A 1 \\ t W;A 2 = sur 1 (t 1 ) W 1 ;A\n1\n\\ sur\n1\n(t\n2\n)\nW\n1\n;A\n1\n= sur\n1\n(t)\nW\n1\n;A\n1\n.\nt = t\n1\n_ t\n2\n. Similar to the above ase.\nt = f(t\n1\n; : : : ; t\nn\n). By indu tion hypothesis, t\nW;A i = sur 1 (t i ) W 1 ;A\n1\nfor 1 i n. Hen e,\nt\nW;A\n= f\nW\n(t\nW;A 1 ; : : : ; t W;A n ) = f W (sur 1 (t 1 ) W 1 ;A\n1\n; : : : ; sur\n1\n(t\nn\n)\nW\n1\n;A\n1\n) = sur\n1\n(t)\nW\n1\n;A\n1\n(sin e f\nW\n= f\nW\n1\n).\nt = g(t\n1\n; : : : ; t\nn\n). In this ase, t\nW;A\n= b\n1\n(g\nW\n2\n(b(t\nW;A 1 ); : : : ; b(t W;A n ))). Sin e, by the\nabove equalities, sur\n1\n(t)\nW\n1\n;A\n1\n= b\n1\n(sur\n2\n(t)\nW\n2\n;A\n2\n), it remains to show that sur\n2\n(t)\nW\n2\n;A\n2\n=\ng\nW\n2\n(b(t\nW;A 1 ); : : : ; b(t W;A n )). Sin e we have sur 2 (t) W 2 ;A\n2\n= g\nW\n2\n(sur\n2\n(t\n1\n)\nW\n2\n;A\n2\n; : : : ; sur\n2\n(t\nn\n)\nW\n2\n;A\n2\n),\nthis amounts to showing that b(t\nW;A i ) = sur 2 (t i ) W 2 ;A\n2\nfor 1 i n. This, however,\nfollows by indu tion hypothesis together with the above equations.\nThis on ludes the proof of the dire tion from (2) to (1).\nIt remains to prove the dire tion from (1) to (2). Suppose hW;Ai j= , for someW 2M\nand A = hA\n1\n;A\n2\ni. Put\nD = fs 2 C\n1\n( ) : s\nW;A\n6= ;g:\nNote that the fusion of lo al ADLs is a lo al ADL again.

Then x is not a surrogate, and so A\n1 1 (x) = A 1 (x).

To ensure that\nthe merging of models su eeds, we must enfor e that the elements of\n1\n( ) and\n2\n( )\nform -partitions (for some appropriate ) of the models to be merged. For\n1\n( ), this\nis aptured by the following lemma. Expli itly stating a dual of this lemma for\n2\n( ) is\nomitted for brevity.\nLemma 47.

Sin e the fusion of two lo al ADSs is again lo al,\nthe set of models M is losed under disjoint unions. Hen e, there exists a model W\n1\nand an assignment A\n1\nsu h that s\nW\n1\n;A\n1\n6= ; for all s 2\n1\n. It follows that the set\n1\n:= fa\ns\n: s j s 2\n1\ng is satis able in (L;M).

Let F\nW\n(resp. G\nW\n) denote the restri tion of (F [G)\nW\nto the symbols\nin F (resp. G). Similarly, R\nW\nand Q\nW\nare the restri tions of (R [Q)\nW\nto the symbols in\nR and Q, respe tively.

They are similar, so we on entrate on the rst. In the proof of Theorem 20 it was possible to onstru t the required model for by merging models for\n1\nand\n2\n. The situation is di erent here. It\nis not possible to merge models for\n1\nand\n2\nin one step, sin e we do not know whether\nthey satisfy sur\n1\n(\nW\n1\n) = > and sur\n2\n(\nW\n1\n) = >, respe tively.

To merge models of this type we have to distinguish various pie es of the models and have to add new pie es as well. To de ne those pie es we need a te hni al laim.

    "abstractText" : "Fusions are a simple way of ombining logi s. For normal modal logi s, fusions have been investigated in detail. In parti ular, it is known that, under ertain onditions, deidability transfers from the omponent logi s to their fusion. Though des ription logi s are losely related to modal logi s, they are not ne essarily normal. In addition, ABox reasoning in des ription logi s is not overed by the results from modal logi s. In this paper, we extend the de idability transfer results from normal modal logi s to a large lass of des ription logi s. To over di erent des ription logi s in a uniform way, we introdu e abstra t des ription systems, whi h an be seen as a ommon generalization of des ription and modal logi s, and show the transfer results in this general setting.",
