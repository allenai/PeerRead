{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Improving Stochastic Gradient Descent with Feedback", "abstract": "In this paper we propose a simple and efficient method for improving stochastic gradient descent methods by using feedback from the objective function. The method tracks the relative changes in the objective function with a running average, and uses it to adaptively tune the learning rate in stochastic gradient descent. We specifically apply this idea to modify Adam, a popular algorithm for training deep neural networks. We conduct experiments to compare the resulting algorithm, which we call Eve, with state of the art methods used for training deep learning models. We train CNNs for image classification, and RNNs for language modeling and question answering. Our experiments show that Eve outperforms all other algorithms on these benchmark tasks. We also analyze the behavior of the feedback mechanism during the training process.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "As you noted for Figure 5 Left, sometimes it seems sufficient to tune learning rates.

Similarly, one can define d_t directly. The behaviour of d_t that you show is not extraordinary and can be parameterized.

There is no theoretical analysis of this variant, but there is an extensive empirical evaluation. A disadvantage of the proposed approach is that it has 3 parameters to tune, but the same parameters are used across experiments. Overall however, the PCs believe that this paper doesn't quite reach the level expected for ICLR and thus cannot be accepted.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "06 Feb 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer3", "TITLE": "Review", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The paper introduced an extension of Adam optimizer that automatically adjust learning rate by comparing the subsequent values of the cost function during training. The authors empirically demonstrated the benefit of the Eve optimizer on CIFAR convnets, logistic regression and RNN problems.\n\nI have the following concerns about the paper\n\n- The proposed method is VARIANT to arbitrary shifts and scaling to the cost function.  \n\n- A more fair comparison with other baseline methods would be using additional exponential decay learning scheduling between the lower and upper threshold of d_t. I suspect 1/d_t just shrinks as an exponential decay from Figure 2.\n\n- Three additional hyper-parameters: k, K, \\beta_3.\n\nOverall, I think the method has its fundamental flew and the paper offers very limited novelty. There is no theoretical justification on the modification, and it would be good for the authors to discuss the potential failure mode of the proposed method. Furthermore, it is hard for me to follow Section 3.2. The writing quality and clarity of the method section can be further improved.   \n ", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 5, "DATE": "20 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer1", "TITLE": "A learning rate tuning method for Adam", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The paper demonstrates a semi-automatic learning rate schedule for the Adam optimizer, called Eve.
