      "text" : "In this paper we study different concepts of independence for convex sets of probabilities. There will be two basic ideas for independ ence. The first is irrelevance. Two variables are independent when a change on the know ledge about one variable does not affect the other. The second one is factorization. Two variables are independent when the joint con vex set of probabilities can be decomposed on the product of marginal convex sets. In the case of the Theory of Probability, these two starting points give rise to the same defini tion. In the case of convex sets of probabil ities, the resulting concepts will be strongly related, but they will not be equivalent. As application of the concept of independence, we shall consider the problem of building a global convex set from marginal convex sets of probabilities.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nConvex sets of probabilities have been used as a model for unknown or partially known probabilities (Carro et al. 1991, Dempster 1967, Levi 1985 , Stirling and Mor re l 1991, Walley 1991). The basic idea is that if for a variable we do not have the exact values of probabilit ies, we may have a convex set of probability distribu tions. From a behavioural point of view the use of con vex sets of probabilities was justified by Walley (1991}. According to this author what distinguishes this theory from the Bayesian one is that imprecision in probab ility and utility models is admited. Strict bayesians assume that for each event there is some betting rate you consider fair: you are ready to bet on either side of the bet. This rate determines the exact value of your subjective probability of the event. Convex sets of probabilities arose by assuming that for each event\nthere is a maximum rate at which you are prepared to bet on it (determining its lower probability) and a minimum rate (determining its upper probability).\nWe consider convex sets with a finite set of extreme probabilities. This makes possible the calculations with convex sets: we have to carry out the operations for the finite set of extreme points.\nIn probability theory perhaps the most important concept is the concept of independence. The knowledge of independence relationships among a set of variables gives rise to the decomposition of the global probability in more elementary parts. This factorization is funda mental to represent and to calculate with probability distributions involving a non trivial number of vari ables (Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter 1988, Pearl 1988, Shenoy and Shafer 1990).\nThere are two main approaches to define independence:\n- Irrelevance condition. - Two variables are inde pendent if no piece of information about one of them can change our state of knowledge about the other.\n- Decomposition condition. - Two variables are in dependent if the global information about the two variables can be expressed as a combination of two pieces of knowledge, one for each variable.\nBoth approachess are equivalent in the case of Clas sical Probability Theory, but things are not so easy for convex sets of probabilities. First. these conditions can have different interpretations leading to different definitions. The irrelevance property depends on the definition of conditioning that is being used and as it is well known there are different ways of doing con ditioning in upper and lower probabilities (Moral and Campos 1991, Dubois and Prade 1994 ). Furthermore, the decomposition property can be applied to the in dividual probabilities or to the complete convex set of probabilities.\nSeveral authors have considered different concepts of\nIndependence Concepts for Convex Sets of Probabilities 109\nindependence in the literature. Amarger et al. (1991) consider the decomposition property at the level of single probabilities. That is, independence can be expressed as a factorization of all the possible prob abilities. This is called the sensitivity approach by Walley (1991). The decomposition property in terms of global convex sets has been considered by Shenoy (1994 ) and Cano et al. (1993 ). The irrelevance con dition has been considered by Walley (1991), but only under one definition of conditioning, the so called up per and lower probabilities conditioning (Moral and Campos 1991, Dubois and Prade 1994 ). Campos and Huete (1993 ) have considered the definition of inde pendence by means of the irrelevance condition with several definitions of conditioning, but they consider the model of upper and lower envelopes, a model which is more restrictive than general convex sets of probab ilities.\nThe objective of this paper is to make an extensive study of independence in convex sets of probabilit ies. Section 2 introduces the essential concepts for convex sets of probabilities. Section 3 studies the dif ferenct definitions of independence and their relation ships. Section 4 is devoted to conditional independ ence. Finally section 5 considers the problem of build ing a global convex set from marginal convex sets. This is a problem strongly related with independence, be cause the hypothesis of independence usually allows to determine an only global representation of uncertainty with the given marginals.\n2 CALCULUS WITH CONVEX SETS OF PROBABILITIES\nIn this section we describe a model for the calculation with convex sets of probabilities. Assume that we have a population !:1 and a variable X defined on !:1 and taking its values on a finite set U = { ui, ... , un }. We shall consider that our knowledge about how X takes its values is represented by a convex set of probabilities, Hx, with a finite set of extreme points Ext(Hx) = {PI, ... ,pk}. Each p; is a probability dis tribution on U and Ext(HX) are the extreme points of Hx. Before going on we need to fix some notation. Assume that h is a function from U x V onto IR and h' a function from V x W onto IR, then the multiplication of these two functions is a function, h.h', defined on U x V x W and given by, h.h'(u, v, w) = h(u, v).h'(v, w). We will interpret this definition on an extensive way. For example it will be applied also to the case in which h' is defined on V instead of V x W. Then, h.h' will be defined on U x V and we only have to drop coordin-\nate w in above expression: h.h'(u, v) = h(u, v).h'(v). Analogously if h is defined on U and h' on W, then h.h' is defined on U x W with h.h'(u, w) = h(u).h'(w). This operation is extended to convex sets of func tions. If H and H' are convex sets with Ext(H) = {hi, . .. , hk }, Ext(H' ) = {h�, ... ,h;}. Then the com bination of H and H' will be the convex set, H 120 H' given by\nH 120 H' = CH{hi .h� , .. , hi.h;, ... , hk .h�, .. , hk.h; } where CH stands for the convex hull operator (the min imum convex set containing a given set).\nIf h is a function from U x V onto IR, then the marginal of h to U is the function h·W defined on U and given by, h·W (u) = LvEV h(u, v). The marginalization on V is defined on an analogous way. This definition can be extended also to convex sets. If H is a convex set of functions on U x V, with extreme points, Ext (H) = {hi, . . . , hk }, then the marginalization of H to U is the convex set given by, H.J,U- (''H {l.j,U I W} - j li ' . .. ' lk In the following, we give the elementary concepts to work with several variables under convex sets of prob abilities. We shall assume that X and Y are variables taking values on finite sets U and V, respectively.\nIf we have a global convex set H X,Y with extreme points {PI, ... , Pk } of possible bidimensional probabil ities for variables (X, Y), then we define the marginal convex sets, Hx and HY, for variables X and Y , as follows:\nHx =(Hx,Y).J,u =CH {Piw , ... , pk.J,u }\nHy = (HX,Y ).J,�' = CH{p!'J.Ii , ... , Pk.J,V} From a global convex set H X,Y we can obtain also a conditional set, HYIX, given by\nHYIX c·'H{ 1 .J,u 1 w} = j PI PI ' . .. ' Pk Pk\nwhere the division stands for pointwise division, p;jpiW (u, v) = Pi(u, v)IPiW (u), being 010 = 0. If we start with some global set H X,Y and we calcu late the marginal set H x and the conditional set HYIX, then the initial global set can not always be recovered from H x and HYIX. In effect, if we calculate the com bination of these two sets, we will obtain the global set H'X,Y = Hx ® HYIX. However, in general, we will have that HX,Y is included into H'X,Y, but they will not be always equal. This situation is different of the case of probability theory. When we have a single probability distribution, the global probability can be obtained from a marginal and a conditional, but this is\n110 De Campos and Moral\nnot true for convex sets. H'X,Y is the biggest convex set having H X as marginal and HYIX as conditional. It is calculated by multiplying each point in H X by each point in HYIX and then taking the convex hull. The elements of Hx are the marginal probabilities of the probabilities in H X,Y. Analogously, the elements of HYIX are the conditional probabilities. The difference with H'X,Y is that in HX,Y we do not have necessarily the combination of all the marginal functions on H X and all the conditional functions in HYIX. What we know is that for every marginal in H x there is at least one conditional in HYIX, such that their product is in H X,Y and that for every conditional in HYIX there is at least one marginal in H X, with the product of the two in HX,Y.\nThis problem has some relationship with the determin ation of causal relationships between variables. In gen eral, when X is a cause of Y, the determination of the marginal probability in X and the conditional probab ility of Y given X should be independent (Spirtes et al. 1993 ). In such a case, if H X,Y is a global convex set for X and Y , we should have HX,Y = Hx 0HYIX. Taking this idea as basis, but without pretending to character ize causal relationships, we will say that X is a cause of Y under HX,Y if and only if HX,Y = Hx ® HYIX. Now, we consider the problem of conditioning in the sense of focusing (Dubois and Prade 1994 ), that is when we incorporate observations for a particular case to general probabilistic knowledge. First we shall con sider the definition of conditioning proposed by Moral and Campos (1991).\nAssume a convex set for variable X: H X CH{p1, . .. , Pk} and that we have observed 'X belongs to A', then the result of conditioning is the convex set, XI H 1A, generated by points {p1.lA, . . . ,pk.lA} where lA is the likelihood associated with set A (lA(u) = 1, if u E A;lA(u) = 0, otherwise). That is HxhA = Hx 0 {lA} It is important to remark that Hx hA is a convex set of differently normalized functions. If we call r = l:uEU p ( u) .lA ( u) = p (A), then by calculating (p.lA)/r (when r -=/= 0) we get the conditional probab ility distribution p ( .lA). The set H X 12A = {p( .lA) : p E H,p(A)-=/= 0} was propossed by Dempster (1967) as the set of conditioning, and has been widely used. However by considering only this set, we loose informa tion. The reason being that, by normalizing each prob ability, we forget the normalization values, r = p (A), which are a likelihood induced by the observation on the set of possible probability distributions.\nIf H1 and Hz are two convex sets of non-necessarily normalized functions we will consider that they are equivalent if and only if there is an a > 0 such that\nCH(H1 U{h0}) = CH(H2U {h0} ) .a, where h0 is the null function: h0 (u) = 0, VuE U. Reasons for this equival ence are given by Cano et al. (1991). The underlying idea is that multiplying all the functions of the convex set by the same real number we get an equivalent set. It says also that the presence of the null function does not change our state of belief.\nThese two definitions can be extended to the case in which lis a general likelihood function, l : U--+ [0, 1]. Hxl1 l is equal to Hx 0 {l} and Hxlzl is defined as {p.lfr : p E Hx, r = l:uEU p.l (u), r-=/= 0}. If we have variables X and Y taking values on U and V respectively and HX,Y is a global convex set of prob abilities for these two variables, then by H xI ! (Y E B) we will denote the Moral and Campos conditioning of HX,Y to the set U x B and the marginalization of the result to U. That is, Hxh(Y E B) = (HX,YhU x B)W. Analogously, for the Dempster conditioning we will consider HxJ2(Y E B)= (HX.YJzU x B)W. If B = { v }, then Hx J;(Y E B) will be denoted as Hxi;(Y = v) (i = 1, 2). If ly is a likelihood function about Y, ly : V --+ [0, 1], then H x h ly, will denote the Moral and Campos con ditioning of HX,Y to the likelihood on U x V given by l ( u, v) = ly ( v) and the marginalization of the result to U. That is Hxhly = (HX,Y 0 {ly }).1-u. On the same way, H X l2ly will denote the Dempster conditioning of H X,Y to l and the posterior marginalization to U.\n3 INDEPENDENCE\nAssume that we have a two-dimensional variable (X, Y) taking values on the cartesian product U x V. In this section we shall consider the conditions under which variables X and Y can be considered as inde pendent, when the global information about these vari ables is given by a convex set of probabilities. Previ ously we will recall the definition of independence for a single probability distribution.\nDefinition 1 We say that X and Y are independent under global probability p, if and only if one of the following equivalent conditions is verified\n1. p (u, v) = p.).U (u).p.).V (v), V(u, v) E U x V 2. p (uJv) =pW (u),V(u,v) with p.i.V (v) > 0\nwhere p (uJv) = p (u, v)jp.).V (v) is the conditional prob ability.\nA first definition of independence when we have more than an only probability distribution is to assume that all the possible probabilities verify above condition. However this condition is too strong if we want to work\nIndependence Concepts for Convex Sets of Probabilities 111\nwith convex sets, as it is shown by the following the orem.\nTheorem 1 Assume that HX,Y is a non-empty con vex set of probabilities defined on U x V, then if HX,Y � {p.p1 : p E Hx,p1 E Hy} we have that some of the marginal sets Hx or HY is trivial in the sense that it contains only one probability distribution.\nTo extend this definition of independence on a non trivial way to the case of imprecise probabilities, we propose two alternatives: the first is to define inde pendence for general sets ( without assuming that the knowledge is always represented by means of a convex set) ; the second is to impose the condition of independ ence only for the extreme points of the convex set.\nDefinition 2 (Type-1) If H is a set of joint probab ility distributions (non necessarily convex) for (X, Y), then we say that X and Y are type-1 independ ent, which will be denoted as h (X, Y), if and only if for every p E H it is verified: p ( u, v) p.J.U (u).p.J.V (v), V(u, v) E U x V\nDefinition 3 (Type-2) If HX,Y is a convex set of probability distributions for (X, Y), then we say that X and Y are type-2 independent, which will be denoted as h(X, Y), if and only if for every p E Ext(HX,Y) it is verified: p (u,v) =p.J.U(u).p.J.V(v),'v'(u,v) E U x V\nType-1 independence is called by Walley ( 1991) the sensitivity analysis approach to independence. Al though these definitions look as a very natural exten sion of independence they have severe inconvenients as the following example shows.\nExample.- Consider U = {u1,u2}, V = {v1,v2} and the probabilities Pl and P2, on U x V given by\npl (u1,v1) = 1, Pl (u;,vj) = 0, otherwise P2(u2, v2) = 1, P2 (u;, Vj) = 0, otherwise\nIf H = {Pl, P2}, we obtain that X and Y are type-1 independent. However, this is not very intuitive: un der H there is functional dependence between X and Y. The only possible pairs are ( u1, vl) and ( u2, v2). Therefore, if we know that X = u1 then we obtain that Y = v1 and if X = u2 we have Y = v2. Things are very similar if we assume that we have the convex set generated by these two probabilities: CH(H) . We have type-2 independence and the same functional dependence between the variables •\nThe problem with above example is that each single probability distribution determines an independent re-\nlationship between the variables, but the two probabil ities at the same time determine a functional relation ship. In general, independence is very related with de composition. But the appropriate way of defining inde pendence in terms of decomposition is not by assuming that every probability is decomposable, but by assum ing that the global set is decomposable. This idea was proposed by Shenoy ( 1994) for the case of general ab stract valuations and it is applied to the particular case of convex set of probabilities in the following definition.\nDefinition 4 (Type-3) If HX,Y is a global convex set of probabilities for (X, Y), we say that X and Y are type-3 independent, h(X, Y), if and only if,\nHX,Y = Hx ® HY\nwhere H X and HY are the marginal sets of H X,Y on U and V respectively\nIn the case of the example it is clear that there is not type-3 independence. It is also immediate to show the following proposition.\nProposition 1 If I3 (X, Y), then h(X, Y).\nOne of the most intuitive ways of defining independence is by means of the concept of irrelevance (Walley 1991, Campos and Huete 1993) : if nothing that can be learnt about Y can change our state of knowledge about X. The way of introducing an observation about Y is by means of conditioning. As there are two main ways of conditioning in convex sets of probabilities, then taking as basis this idea, we get two concepts of independence.\nDefinition 5 (Type-4) We say that variable X is type-4 independent of variable Y , I4(X, Y), under con vex set H X,Y if and only if for every likelihood ly defined on V, we have that H x l1ly is equivalent to Hx or to 0.\nDefinition 6 (Type-5) We say that variable X zs type-5 independent of variable Y, h(X, Y), under convex set HX,Y if and only if for every likelihood ly defined on V, we have that H X l2ly = H X or Hxl2ly = 0.\nThe following proposition is immediate from the defin itions of type-4 , type-5 independence and conditioning.\nProposition 2 If I4(X, Y) then Is(X, Y).\nOn the contrary to the case of a single probability, for type-4 and type-5 independence the equality of the marginal and the conditional information to the events [ Y = v] is not sufficient to assure the equality of the marginal and the conditional to an arbitrary likelihood on Y: ly.\n112 De Campos and Moral\nExample.- Assume that U { u1, u2}, V { v1, v2, v3} and the convex set H X,Y with the extreme points, Pl, P2, P3, P4, given by:\n(u1, v!) (u1, v2) (u1, va) (u2, v!) (u2,v2) (u2, va) P1 1/3 0 0 2/3 0 0 P2 1/4 0 0 3 /4 0 0 P3 0 0. 1 0. 2 0 0.3 0. 4 P4 0 0. 15 2/15 0 0. 4 5 4 /15\nIn this case, it is easy to show that 'Vv E V, H x = H x 12 (Y = v). However, if we calculate the condi tiona! information to the likelihood, ly, given by\nly (vl) = O, ly(v2) = 1, ly(v3) = 1 then we obtain a different convex set.\nFor the case of type-4 independence, above example is valid too. All the conditional sets H xI I(Y = v) are equivalent to H X, but the conditional set to likelihood ly gives rise to a non-equivalent convex set. •\nType-4 and Type-5 independences do not imply type-2 independence as the following example shows.\nExample.- Consider U = { u1, u2}, V = { v1 , v2}, and the convex set H X,Y with extreme points, P1, P2, p3, given by\nPl 0. 24 P2 0. 15 P3 0. 15\n0. 5 6 0. 3 5 0.5 6\n0. 06 0. 15 0. 15\n0. 14 0. 3 5 0. 14\nIn these conditions, we have I4(X, Y) and I5(X, Y), but P3 is an extreme point which is not decomposable as product of its marginal probability distributions.\nThis example shows also that type-4 and type-5 inde pendences are not symmetrical. In fact, we have that X is type-4 (and type-5 ) independent of Y , but Y is neither type-4 nor type-5 independent of X. •\nThere is a relationship between type-4 , type-5 inde pendences and type-2 independence. In fact, in both cases we can prove the following theorem, which says that although not all the single extreme probabilities show independence between X and Y there are neces sarily some extreme probabilities under which there is X,Y independence.\nTheorem 2 - If I4(X, Y ) then Hx ® Hy � Hx,Y - If h(X, Y) then 'Vp E Ext (HY), 3q E Hx, such\nthat p.q E HX,Y\nUnder type-4 independence, we do not have necessar ily the equality Hx ® HY = HX,Y, as was shown in above example. To get the decomposition of type-:3 in dependence, we should add some additional condition\nto type-4 independence. The combination of type-4 and type-2 independence is appropriate for this purpose.\nTheorem 3 h(X, Y) if and only if I2(X, Y) and I4(X, Y).\nUnder type-2 independence type-4 and type-5 inde pendence are symmetrical concepts and we do not need to specify which variable is independent of the other.\nWe have determined another properties which are al ways verified under type-3 independence and not under type-4 independence, as the following one: for all con vex set of probabilities for variables X, Y, and Z, such that X, Y has HX,Y as marginal information and such that X, Y is a cause of Z, we have that X is a cause of Z and Y is a cause of Z. In other words, for every convex set about the three variables H X,Y,Z, if this set can be decomposed as HX,Y ® HZIX,Y, then the marginal on X, Z, Hx,z can be decomposed as Hx ®HZIX and the marginal on Y, Z, decomposed as, HY,Z = HY ®HZIY_ This is a very natural property under independence of X and Y , which is verified under type-3 independence, but not under type-4 independence. However, we have not proved yet, whether this property together with type-4 independence is equivalent to type-3 independ ence.\nThere is also an strong relationship between type-2 and type-5 independence.\nTheorem 4 If h(X, Y), then h(X, Y) if and only zf 'Vp E Hx, 'Vv E V, if3p' E HY with p' (v) > 0, we have that 3p\" E Hy with p\"(v) > 0 and p.p\" E HX,Y\nMost of the differences among the different notions of independence come from the correlations which can ex ist between marginal and conditional probabilities in a global convex set H X, Y. In fact, if X is a cause of Y (or vice versa) all the different independencies for con vex sets are equivalent.\nTheorem 5 If X is a cause of Y under HX,Y, that is HX,Y = Hx ® HYIX, then I2 (X, Y) <=> h(X, Y) <=> I4(X, Y) <=> h(X, Y)\n4 CONDITIONAL INDEPENDENCE\nThe concept of independence reaches a big degree of expressiveness when one can talk about conditional in dependence. X and Y are conditionally independent given Z, when they are independent under a perfect knowledge of the value of Z. First we give a precise meaning of this concept in the case of classical prob ability theory. It will be assumed that X, Y, and Z are three variables taking values on U , V, and W, respect ively.\nIndependence Concepts for Convex Sets of Probabilities 113\nDefinition 7 We say that variables X andY are con ditionally independent given Z under global probability p, if and only if one of the following equivalent condi tions is verified\n1. p(u, vlw) = p.).UxW (ulw) .p.).VxW (vlw), 'v' ( u, v, w) with p.). w ( w) > 0 2. p(u, v, w) = p.).VxW (v, w).p.).UxW (ulw), 'v'(u, v, w) with p.).W (w) > 0\nFor the case of imprecise probabilities, the definitions of marginal independence can be extended to the case of conditional independence.\nDefinition 8 (Type-1) If H is a set of joint prob ability distributions (non necessarily convex) for (X, Y, Z), then we say that X and Y are type-1 condi tionally independent given Z, which will be denoted as It (X, Y IZ), if and only if Definition 7 is verified for every p E H.\nDefinition 9 (Type-2) If HX,Y,Z is a convex set of probability distributions for (X, Y, Z), then we say that X andY are type-2 conditionally independent given Z, h (X, Y I Z), if and only if Definition 7 is verified for every p E Ext (HX,Y,z).\nDefinition 10 (Type-3) If HX,Y,Z is a global con vex set of probabilities for (X, Y, Z), we say that X and Y are type-3 conditionally independent given Z, Is(X, YIZ), if and only if,\nHX,Y,Z = Hl ® H2\nwhere H1 is a convex set of functions on U x W and H 2 is a convex set of functions on V x W .\nLet us remark that in above definition there is no neces sity that H1 or H2 is a marginal or conditional convex set obtained from H X,Y,Z. In fact in some occasions only it is only possible a decompostion in which H1 contains the conditional probabilities of X given Z and a part of the marginal information about Z. To obtain a marginal distribution about Z, we have to multiply this part with the one in the other convex set H2. That was not the case of unconditional independence. If a bidimensional convex H x, Y, is decomposed as product of a convex set on U and a convex set about V, we can always assume that these convex sets are the marginal sets of HX,Y.\nDefinition 11 (Type-4) We say that variable X is type-4 conditionally independent of variable Y given Z, /4(X, YIZ), under convex set HX,Y,Z if and only if for every likelihood ly defined on V and every w E W we have that H X h (ly, Z = w) is equivalent to H x h (Z = w) or to0.\nDefinition 12 (Type-5) We say that variable X lS type-5 conditional independent of variable Y given Z, h(X, YIZ) , under convex set HX,Y,Z if and only lf for every likelihood [y defined on V and every w E W , we have that Hxl2(ly,Z = w) = Hxi2(Z = w) or Hxl2(ly,Z=w)=0.\nTheorem 6 If H X,Y,Z is a global convex set for van abies X, Y, Z, then we have the following implicatwns,\nI3(X, YIZ) ==> I2 (X , YIZ), I4(X, YIZ)\nI4(X, YIZ) ==> I5(X, YIZ)\nOn the contrary to the case of unconditional independ ence, we can have type-2 and type-4 conditional inde pendence without having type-3 independence.\nExample.- Assume that W = {0, 1} and that H X,Y,Z is the convex hull generated by points: Pl (u, v, w) Pl (ulw).p(w).p�(vlw),P2(u, v, w) P2 (ulw).p(w).p�(vlw), where for w = 0 we have that pl (.IO) = P2(.IO), p� (.IO) # p� (.IO) and for w = 1 we have p� ( . l l) = p�(.ll),pl(.ll) -# P2(.11). In these conditions, there is type-2 and type-4 condi tional independence but not type-3 independence. •\nWe can obtain interesting results when we mix condi tional independence with causal relationships.\nTheorem 7 If H X,Y.Z is a global convex set, such that one of the following conditions is verified:\na) Z is a cause of X, Y b) X,Z is a cause ofY c) Y, Z is a cause of X\nthen I2(X, YIZ) {::} I3(X, YIZ) {::} I4(X, YIZ) <:::> h(X, YIZ). Furthermore if there is conditional independence, we have the following decompositions in each one of the cases:\na) Hx,Y,Z =Hz ® HXIZ@ HYIZ b) HX,Y,Z = HX,Z ® HYIZ c) HX,Y,Z = HY,Z@ HXIZ\n5 THE MARGINAL PROBLEM\nIn this section and as an application of the concept of independence, we consider the following problem: as sume that we have three variables, X, Y , and Z and that we have two convex sets of probabilities, H 1, about variables X, Z and H2, about variables Y, Z. The question is how to build on a reasonable way a global set HX,Y,Z from this marginal information.\n114 De Campos and Moral\nFor the case of a single probability distribution, if P1 is a marginal probability for variables X, Z and pz is a marginal probability for variables Y, Z, then the prob lem is solved in two steps:\n1. We check the compatibility of the two marginal distributions. That is, whether PTw = P!w. 2. In the case of compatibility, we fix a criterion allowing us to determine an unique probability among all those p on U x V x W having P1 and pz as marginals. The most usual hypothesis is to assume that X andY are conditional independent given Z. Then, we obtain the probability:\np(u, v, w) = P1(u, w).pz(v, w)/PTw (w) For convex sets of probabilities, the steps are:\n1. Make H1 and Hz consistent, by transforming them into H� and H� given by,\nH� = {p E H1 : p.J.W E H�w } H� = {p E Hz : p.J.W E Hfw }\nIf H� = H� = 0 then we have inconsistency. In other case, H'Tw = H'!w =J 0 and we have been able of reaching consistency.\n2. In the case of consistency, we have to assume a condition on X, Y, and Z, allowing to determine an unique convex set of probabilities, H, defined on U x V x W, with H� and H� as marginals. This problem is not as easy as in the case of a single probability distribution. An initial diffi culty is clear: we have several definitions of in dependence. The rest of the section is devoted to give a reasonable answer to this question.\nWe consider that H1 and Hz are two compatible con vex sets, that is, Hfw = H�w =J 0. To determine a global convex set under an assumption of independ ence, the firsts thing that we can observe is that not always we can assume type-:3 conditional independence. Type-3 independence is the strongest condition we have studied and it is a first candidate to be considered as hypothesis to fix a global H. The reason is that this definition is directly related with the idea of decompos ition. However, the following example shows that we can have two compatible H 1 and Hz for which there is no global set H having H1 and Hz as marginals with type-3 conditional independence.\nExample.- Assume U = V = W = { 0, 1}. Let H1 be the convex set on U x W given by extreme points:\nPi(O, 1) = 0. 99, pi{1, 0) = O.Ol,pi(u, w) = 0, otherwise p�(l, 1) = 1, p�( u, w) = 0, otherwise\nAnd Hz the convex set on V x W given by: pr(O, 1) = 0. 99, pi( 1, 0) = 0.01,pi(v, w) = 0, otherwise\np�(l , 1) = l,p�(v, w) = 0, otherwise\nIn this case, there is an only convex set with type-2 independence and with H1 and Hz as marginal sets, the one given by the extreme probabilities p1 and P2 on U x V x W defined by:\n1 2 Pi(u, v, w) =Pi (u, w).pi (vlw), i = 1,:2\nHowever with this convex set we do not have type-3 independence. •\nGiven the definitions, there seems more difficult to work with type-4 and type-5 independence. So the natural candidate is to impose type-2 independence as hypothesis. There is another difficulty with this hy pothesis. There is not always an unique convex set compatible with given marginals and verifying type2 independence. As example, consider that H1 = CH ({pi, PH) and Hz = CH ({pi , PD) in such a way that Pi.J.W p�.J.W = Pi.J.W = p�.J.W In this case we have compatibility between H1 and Hz, but there are several convex sets having H 1 and H 2 as mar ginal sets and verifying type-2 conditional independ ence of X with respect to Y given Z. Among them, we could consider the convex set generated by points: 1 2/ z.J.W 1 z; z.J.W. th t d P1 -P1 p1 , Pz ·Pz Pz , or e convex se generate\nby points: Pi-PVP�.J.W ,p� .pifpr.J.W However, there is always a least specific convex set verifying type-2 conditional independence (in the sense that it contains every other convex set verifying this hypothesis) . In this case, this convex set is given by,\n1Z 1Z 1 2 1Z HX,Y,Z = CH ({P1·P1 Pz·Pz P1·Pz Pz·P1 }) z.J.W , z.J.W , z.J.W , z.J.W P1 Pz Pz P1\nIn general we can prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 8 If H1 is a convex set of probabilities on U x W and H 2 is a convex set of probabilities on V x W, such that Hfw = H�w , then the convex set, H X,Y,Z, on U x V x W, given by XYZ C ({Pl·P2 .J.W .J.W }) H ' ' = H � : Pl E H 1, Pz E H 2, P1 = Pz Pz\nverifies the following properties,\n1. (HX,Y,Z ).J.UxW = H1, (HX,Y,Z ) .J.VxW = H2 2. lz(X, Y IZ) under HX,Y,Z 3. Every convex set of probabilities H on U x V x W\nverifying 1 and 2, is included in H X,Y,Z\nThis will be our proposal for the construction of a global convex set from compatible marginal sets, H1 and H2. The global convex set, HX,Y,Z built in above theorem will be denoted as H 1 0 H 2. There is another result justifying this selection: if there is a global set under which there is type-3 conditional independence\nIndependence Concepts for Convex Sets of Probabilities 115\nthen HX,Y,Z will coincide with this set. This is stated in the following theorem.\nTheorem 9 If If H1 is a convex set of probabilities on U x W and H2 is a convex set of probabilities on V x W, such that Htw = H�w, and H is a global convex set on U x V x W, verifying:\n1. HiUxW = Hl, H�YxW = H2 2. Is(X,YIZ) underH.\n6 CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper we have studied different concepts of inde pendency for convex sets of probabilities. The situation here is different than in the case of a single probabil ity distribution. Several generalizations of the concept of independence are possible. There is one which is the strongest of all the definitions we have proposed: type-3 independence. Our feeling is that this is the most appropriate definition of independence and that the other definitions consider only partial aspects of the concept of independence. However, some of then can be useful in other situations as the case of type-2 independence in the marginal problem.\nThe main differences among the different definitions come from the correlation that may exists among the probabilities governing the variables. For example, in type-2 independence if we fix a probability, we have in dependence, but the problem is that the determination of the probability can establish a strong relationship between the values of the variables.\nSome aspects of the concept of independence have not been studied by the space limitations of this paper. Among others to check whether graphoid axioms are verified and to study other applications of the concept of independence as the learning of causal networks from data (Pearl 1988). Of special interest is for us the study of the relationships between decomposition properties of convex sets and the determination of causal relation ships.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work has been supported by the DGICYT under Project n.

Two variables are independent when a change on the know­ ledge about one variable does not affect the other. The second one is factorization. Two variables are independent when the joint con­ vex set of probabilities can be decomposed on the product of marginal convex sets. In the case of the Theory of Probability, these two starting points give rise to the same defini­ tion. In the case of convex sets of probabil­ ities, the resulting concepts will be strongly related, but they will not be equivalent. As application of the concept of independence, we shall consider the problem of building a global convex set from marginal convex sets of probabilities.",
