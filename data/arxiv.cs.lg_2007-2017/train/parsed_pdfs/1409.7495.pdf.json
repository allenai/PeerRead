      "text" : "Deep feed-forward architectures have brought impressive advances to the state-of-the-art across a wide variety tasks within computer vision and beyond. At the moment, however, these leaps in performance emerge only when a large amount of labeled training data is available. At the same time, for problems lacking labeled data, it may be still possible to obtain training sets that are big enough for training large-scale deep models, but that suffer from the shift in data distribution from the actual data encountered at “test time”. One particularly important example is synthetic or semi-synthetic imagery, which may come in abundance and fully labeled, but which inevitably look different from real data [13, 20, 23, 21].\nLearning a discriminative classifier or other predictor in\nthe presence of a shift between training and testing distributions is known as domain adaptation (DA). A number of approaches to domain adaptation has been suggested in the context of shallow learning, e.g. in the situation when data representation/features are given and fixed. The proposed approaches then build the mappings between the source (training-time) and the target (test-time) domains, so that the classifier learned for the source domain can also be applied to the target domain, when composed with the learned mapping between domains. The appeal of the domain adaptation approaches is the ability to learn a mapping between domains in the situation when the target domain data are either fully unlabeled (unsupervised domain annotation) or have few labeled samples (semi-supervised domain adaptation). Below, we focus on the harder unsupervised case, although the proposed approach can be generalized to the semi-supervised case rather straightforwardly.\nUnlike most papers previous papers on domain adaptation that worked with fixed feature representations, we focus on combining domain adaptation and deep feature learning within one training process (deep domain adaptation). Our goal is to embed domain adaptation into the process of learning representation, so that the final classification decisions are made based on features that are both discriminative and invariant to the change of domains, i.e. have the same or very similar distributions in the source and the target domains. In this way, the obtained feed-forward network can be applicable to the target domain without being hindered by the shift between the two domains.\nWe thus focus on learning features that combine (i) discriminativeness and (ii) domain-invariance. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the underlying features as well as two discriminative classifiers operating on these features: (i) the label predictor that predicts class labels and is used at test time and (ii) the domain classifier that discriminates between the source and the target domains during training. While the parameters of the classifiers are optimized in order to minimize their error on the training set, the parameters of the underlying deep feature mapping are optimized in order to minimize the loss of the label classifier and to maximize the loss of the domain classifier. The\n1\nar X\niv :1\n40 9.\n74 95\nv1 [\nst at\n.M L\n] 2\n6 Se\np 20\n14\nlatter encourages domain-invariant features to emerge in the course of the optimization.\nCrucially, we show that all three training processes can be embedded into an appropriately composed deep feedforward network (Figure 1) that uses standard layers and loss functions, and can be trained using standard backpropagation algorithms based on stochastic gradient descent or its modifications (e.g. momentum). Our approach is generic as it can be used to add domain adaptation to any existing feed-forward architecture that is trainable by backpropagation. In practice, the only non-standard component of the proposed architecture is a rather trivial gradient reversal layer that leaves the input unchanged during forward propagation and reverses the gradient by multiplying it by a negative scalar during the backpropagation.\nBelow, we detail the proposed approach to domain adaptation in deep architectures, and present prelimenary results on traditional deep learning datasets (such as MNIST [12] and SVHN [14]) that clearly demonstrate the unsupervised domain adaptation ability of the proposed method."

      "text" : "A large number of domain adaptation methods have been proposed over the recent years, and here we focus on the most related ones. Multiple methods perform unsupervised domain adaptation by matching the feature distributions in the source and the target domains. Some approaches perform this by reweighing or selecting samples from the source domain [3, 11, 7], while others seek an explicit feature space transformation that would map source distribution into the target ones [16, 10, 2]. An important aspect of the distribution matching approach is the way the (dis)similarity between distributions is measured. Here, one popular choice is matching the distribution means in the kernel-reproducing Hilbert space [3, 11], whereas [8, 5] map the principal axes associated with each of the distributions. Our approach also attempts to match feature space distributions, however this is accomplished by modifying the feature representation itself rather than by reweighing or geometric transformation. Also, our method uses (implicitly) a rather different way to measure the disparity between distributions based on their separability by a deep discriminatively-trained classifier.\nSeveral approaches perform gradual transition from the source to the target domain [10, 8] by a gradual change of the training distribution. Among these methods, [17] does this in a “deep” way by the layerwise training of a sequence of deep autoencoders, while gradually replacing source-domain samples with target-domain samples. This improves over a similar approach of [6] that simply trains a single deep autoencoder for both domains. In both approaches, the actual classifier/predictor is learned in a separate step using the feature representation learned by au-\ntoencoder(s). In contrast to [6, 17], our approach performs feature learning, domain adaptation and classifier learning jointly, in a unified architecture, and using a single learning algorithm (backpropagation). We therefore argue that our approach is much simpler (both conceptually and in terms of its implementation).\nWhile the above approaches perform unsupervised domain adaptation, there are approaches that perform supervised domain adaptation by exploiting labeled data from the target domain. In the context of deep feed-forward architectures, such data can be used to “fine-tune” the network trained on the source domain [24, 15, 1]. Our approach does not require labeled target-domain data. At the same time, it can easily incorporate such data when they are available.\nThe work that is most related to ours is the recent (and concurrent) technical report [9] on adversarial networks. While their goal is quite different (building generative deep networks that can synthesize samples), the way they measure and minimize the discrepancy between the distribution of the training data and the distribution of the synthesized data is very similar to the way our architecture measures and minimizes the discrepancy between feature distributions for the two domains."

      "heading" : "3.1. The model",
      "text" : "We now detail the proposed model for the domain adaptation. We assume that the model works with input samples x ∈ X , where X is some input space (e.g. images of a certain size) and certain labels (output) y from the label space Y . Below, we assume classification problems where Y is a finite set (Y = {1, 2, . . . L}), however our approach is generic and can handle any output label space that other deep feed-forward models can handle. We further assume that there exist two distributions S(x, y) and T (x, y) on X ⊗ Y , which will be referred to as the source distribution and the target distribution (or the source domain and the target domain). Both distributions are assumed complex and unknown, and furthermore similar but different (in other words, S is “shifted” from T by some domain shift).\nOur ultimate goal is to be able to predict labels y given the input x for the target distribution. At training time, we have an access to a large set of training samples {x1,x2, . . . ,xN} from both the source and the target domains distributed according to the marginal distributions S(x) and T (x). We denote with di the binary variable (domain label) for the ith example, which indicates whether xi come from the source distribution (xi∼S(x) if di=0) or from the target distribution (xi∼T (x) if di=1). For the examples from the source distribution (di=0) the corresponding labels yi ∈ Y are known at training time. For the examples from the target domains, we do not know the labels\nat training time, and we want to predict such labels at test time.\nWe now define a deep feed-forward architecture that for each input x predicts its label y ∈ Y and its domain label d ∈ {0, 1}. We decompose such mapping into three parts. We assume that the input x is first mapped by a mapping Gf (a feature extractor) to a D-dimensional feature vector f ∈ RD. The feature mapping may also include several feed-forward layers and we denote the vector of parameters of all layers in this mapping as θf , i.e. f = Gf (x; θf ). Then, the feature vector f is mapped by a mapping Gy (label predictor) to the label y, and we denote the parameters of this mapping with θy . Finally, the same feature vector f is mapped to the domain label d by a mapping Gd (domain classifier) with the parameters θd (Figure 1).\nDuring the learning stage, we aim to minimize the label prediction loss on the annotated part (i.e. the source part) of the training set, and the parameters of both the feature extractor and the label predictor are thus optimized in order to minimize the empirical loss for the source domain samples. This ensures the discriminativeness of the features f and the overall good prediction performance of the combination of the feature extractor and the label predictor on the source domain.\nAt the same time, we want to make the features f domain-invariant. That is, we want to make the distributions S(f) = {Gf (x; θf ) |x∼S(x)} and T (f) = {Gf (x; θf ) |x∼T (x)} to be similar. Under the covariate shift assumption, this would make the label prediction ac-\ncuracy on the target domain to be the same as on the source domain [18]. Measuring the dissimilarity of the distributions S(f) and T (f) is however non-trivial, given that f is high-dimensional, and that the distributions themselves are constantly changing as learning progresses. One way to estimate the dissimilarity is to look at the loss of the domain classifierGd, provided that the parameters θd of the domain classifier have been trained to discriminate between the two feature distributions in an optimal way.\nThis leads us to our idea. At training time, in order to obtain domain-invariant features, we seek the parameters θf of the feature mapping that maximize the loss of the domain classifier (by making the two feature distributions as similar as possible), while simultaneously seeking the parameters θd of the domain classifier that minimize the loss of the domain classifier. In addition, we seek to minimize the loss of the label predictor.\nMore formally, we consider the functional:\nE(θf , θy, θd) = ∑ i=1..N di=0 Ly ( Gy(Gf (xi; θf ); θy), yi ) −\nλ ∑ i=1..N Ld ( Gd(Gf (xi; θf ); θd), yi ) =\n= ∑ i=1..N di=0 Liy(θf , θy)− λ ∑ i=1..N Lid(θf , θd) (1)\nHere, Ly(·, ·) is the loss for label prediction (e.g. multinomial), Ld(·, ·) is the loss for the domain classification (e.g.\nlogistic), while Liy and L i d denote the corresponding loss functions evaluated at the ith training example. Based on our idea, we are seeking the parameters θ̂f , θ̂y, θ̂d that deliver a saddle point of the functional (1):\n(θ̂f , θ̂y) = arg min θf ,θy E(θf , θy, θ̂d) (2)\nθ̂d = arg max θd E(θ̂f , θ̂y, θd) . (3)\nAt the saddle point, the parameters θd of the domain classifier θd minimize the domain classification loss (since it enters into (1) with the minus sign) while the parameters θy of the label predictor minimize the label prediction loss. The feature mapping parameters θf minimize the label prediction loss (i.e. the features are discriminative), while maximizing the domain classification loss (i.e. the features are domain-invariant). The parameter λ controls the trade-off between the two objectives that shape the features during learning.\nBelow, we demonstrate that standard stochastic gradient solvers (SGD) can be adapted for the search of the saddle point (2)-(3)."

      "heading" : "3.2. Optimization with backpropagation",
      "text" : "A saddle point (2)-(3) can be found as a stationary point of the following stochastic updates:\nθf ←− θf − µ ( ∂Liy ∂θf − λ∂L i d ∂θf ) (4)\nθy ←− θy − µ ∂Liy ∂θy\n(5)\nθd ←− θd − µ ∂Lid ∂θd\n(6)\nwhere µ is the learning rate (which can vary over time). The updates (4)-(6) are very similar to stochastic gradient descent (SGD) updates for a feed-forward deep model that comprises feature extractor fed into the label predictor and into the domain classifier. The difference is the−λ factor in (4) (the difference is important, as without such factor, stochastic gradient descent would try to make features dissimilar across domains in order to minimize the domain classification loss). Although direct implementation of (4)- (6) as SGD is not possible, it is highly desirable to reduce the updates (4)-(6) to some form of SGD, since SGD (and its variants) is the main learning algorithm implemented in most packages for deep learning.\nFortunately, such reduction can be accomplished by introducing a special gradient reversal layer (GRL) defined as follows. The gradient reversal layer has no parameters associated with it (apart from the meta-parameter λ, which\nis not updated by backpropagation). During the forward propagation, GRL acts as an identity transform. During the backpropagation though, GRL takes the gradient from the subsequent level, multiplies it by −λ and passes it to the preceding layer. Implementing such layer using existing object-oriented packages for deep learning is thus as simple as defining a new layer can be, as defining procedures for forwardprop (identity transform), backprop (multiplying by a constant), and parameter update (nothing) is trivial.\nThe GRL as defined above is inserted between the feature extractor and the domain classifier, resulting in the architecture depicted in Figure 1. As the backpropagation process passes through the GRL, the partial derivatives of the loss that is downstream the GRL (i.e. Ld) w.r.t. the layer parameters that are upstream the GRL (i.e. θf ) get multiplied by −λ, i.e. ∂Ld∂θf is effectively replaced with −λ ∂Ld ∂θf\n. Therefore, running SGD in the resulting model implements the updates (4)-(6) and converges to a saddle point of (1).\nMathematically, we can formally treat the gradient reversal layer as a “pseudo-function” Rλ(x) defined by two (incompatible) equations describing its forward- and backpropagation behaviour:\nRλ(x) = x (7) dRλ dx = −λI (8)\nwhere I is an identity matrix. We can then define the objective “pseudo-function” of (θf , θy, θd) that is being optimized by the stochastic gradient descent within our method:\nẼ(θf , θy, θd) = ∑ i=1..N di=0 Ly ( Gy(Gf (xi; θf ); θy), yi ) +\n∑ i=1..N Ld ( Gd(Rλ(Gf (xi; θf )); θd), yi ) (9)\nRunning SGD for (9) thus leads to the emergence of features that are domain-invariant and discriminative at the same time. After the learning, the label predictor y(x) = Gy(Gf (x; θf ); θy) can be used to predict labels for samples from the target domain (as well as from the source domain).\nThe simple learning procedure outlined above can be rederived/generalized along the lines suggested in [9] (see Appendix)."

In each case, we train on the source dataset and test on a different target domain dataset, with considerable shifts between domains (see Figure 2). Overall, we have six datasets involved into the experiments that are described below.\nThe first four datasets are the well-known MNIST dataset [12] and its modifications. The modifications include:\n• MNIST (D): Binary dilation with a 3×3 all-ones structuring element. This operation makes strokes thicker and may fill small holes thereby introducing additional challenge to the classification task.\n• MNIST (max, BG): Blending white digits over the patches randomly extracted from photos (BSDS500). While leaving meaningful pixels as they are, this modification adds strong background clutter.\n• MNIST (|∆|, BG): Difference-blending digits over the patches randomly extracted from photos (BSDS500). This operation is formally defined for two images I1, I2 as Ioutijk = |I1ijk − I2ijk|, where i, j are the coordinates of a pixel and k is a channel index. In other words, an output sample is produced by taking a patch\nfrom a photo and inverting its pixels at positions corresponding to the pixels of a digit. For a human the classification task becomes only slightly harder compared to the original dataset (the digits are still clearly distinguishable) whereas for a CNN trained on MNIST this domain is quite distinct: the background and the strokes are no longer constant.\nThe last two datasets is the well-known Street View House Number (SVHN) dataset [14] and a new synthetic dataset Syn. Numbers of 500,000 images generated by ourselves from Windows fonts by varying the text (that includes different one-, two-, and three-digit numbers), positioning, orientation, background and stroke colors, and the amount of blur.

We detail the protocol for the use of SA further below.\nThe SA algorithm has one important free parameter, namely the number of principal components.

Although samples from these domains have significant background clutter, our approach succeeded at intermixing the features (Figure 4), which led to very successful adaptation results (considering that the adaptation is unsupervised).

As SVHN is more diverse, a model trained on\nSVHN is expected to be more generic and to perform reasonably on the MNIST dataset. This, indeed, turns out to be the case and is supported by the appearance of the feature distributions. We observe a quite strong separation between the domains when we feed them into the CNN trained solely on MNIST, whereas for the SVHN-trained network the features are much more intermixed. This difference probably explains why our method succeeded in improving the performance by adaptation in the SVHN → MNIST scenario (see Table 1) but not in the opposite direction (SA is not able to perform adaptation in this case either).

Similarly to many previous shallow and deep DA techniques, the adaptation is achieved through aligning the distributions of features across the two domains. However, unlike previous approaches, the alignment is accomplished through standard backpropagation training. The approach is therefore rather scalable, and can be implemented using any deep learning package.\nIn the experiments with digit image classification, the approach demonstrated its efficiency, significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art unsupervised DA method. Further evaluation on larger-scale tasks constitutes the immediate future work. It is also interesting whether the approach can benefit from a good initialization of the feature extrac-\nMNIST→ MNIST (max, BG): top feature extractor layer\ntor. For this, a natural choice would be to use deep autoencoder/deconvolution network trained on both domains (or on the target domain) in a similar vein to [6, 17], effectively using [6, 17] as an initialization to our method."

In the absence of labeled data for a certain task, domain adaptation often provides an attractive option given that labeled data of similar nature but from a different domain (e.g. synthetic images) are available. Here, we propose a new approach to domain adaptation in deep architectures that can be trained on large amount of labeled data from the source domain and large amount of unlabeled data from the target domain (no labeled target-domain data is necessary). As the training progresses, the approach promotes the emergence of “deep” features that are (i) discriminative for the main learning task on the source domain and (ii) invariant with respect to the shift between the domains. We show that this adaptation behaviour can be achieved in almost any feed-forward model by augmenting it with few standard layers and a simple new gradient reversal layer. The resulting augmented architecture can be trained using standard backpropagation. Overall the whole approach can be implemented with little effort using any of the deep-learning packages.",
