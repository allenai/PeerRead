      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "There have been many works and models to estimate the distributed representations of words, i.e. the word embeddings for a corpus (Bengio et al., 2003; Mnih & Hinton, 2007; 2009; Collobert et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2012; Mikolov, 2012; Mikolov et al., 2013b;a;c; Pennington et al., 2014; Bojanowski et al., 2016). Benefiting from the works, high quality word embeddings can be estimated efficiently nowadays.\nWord embeddings are reported useful and improve the performance of the machine learning algorithms for many natural language processing tasks such as name entity recognition and chunking (Turian et al., 2010), text classification (Socher et al., 2012; Le & Mikolov, 2014; Kim, 2014; Joulin et al., 2016), topic extraction (Das et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016), and machine translation (Zaremba et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014).\nNevertheless, there is still room for improvement. For example, for the fine-grained sentiment analysis tasks such as predicating the number of stars of a review, the reported accuracy is much lower than the other text classification tasks (Joulin et al., 2016). It indicates the needs of word representations that embed the semantic information more efficiently.\nBojanowski et al. (2016) attempt to improve word embeddings by involving character level information. There is a big improvement on syntactic questions in the word analogical reasoning task introduced by Mikolov et al. (2013a). However, the accuracy for the semantic part is not improved in the reported results.\nSome works (Yu & Dredze, 2014; Xu et al., 2014; Faruqui et al., 2015; Bollegala et al., 2016) try to estimate better word embeddings by using a lexicon or an ontology. The idea is simple: because a lexicon or an ontology contains well-defined relations about words, word embeddings of high quality can be learned from it, or we can refine trained word embeddings using the lexicon or the ontology.\nHowever, a problem is not well addressed in the previous works using lexicons to learn word embeddings: For a polysemantic word or utterance, its paraphrase in a lexicon or an ontology is not always its paraphrase in different contexts. For example, we can replace the word “Earth” in the sentence “Earth goes around the sun” with its paraphrase “Terra”, however the same word “Earth” in the sentence “I fill the hole with earth” cannot be replaced with “Terra”. Henceforth, the lexicon or the ontology is sometimes unreliable and deteriorates the learning of word embeddings for the polysemantic words and utterances.\nIn this paper, we propose a method to learn word embeddings using both a corpus and a lexicon that is able to alleviate the bad effect of polysemants, by estimating the degree of truth of each paraphrase in the lexicon. Our method for estimating is simple, efficient and easy to be combined with the previous learning algorithms on the basis of co-occurrences of words. The experimental results show that our method is efficient and outperforms the previous works."

      "heading" : "2.1 WORKS ON LEARNING WORD EMBEDDINGS FOR A CORPUS",
      "text" : "The first approaches learning word embeddings use n-gram model (Bengio et al., 2003; Collobert et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2012) and recurrent neural networks (Mikolov, 2012). Recently, more efficient methods like continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) model and skip-gram (SG) model (Mikolov et al., 2013b;a), also called word2vec, provide a more efficient way to learn word embeddings based on the local co-occurrences of words in a corpus. Continuous bag-of-words tries to maximize the log probability of a word given its context, while skip-gram tries to maximize the log probability of the words in the context given a word. Negative sampling is an efficient algorithm to train them, that approximately maximizes the log probability for the targets by doing a logistic regression to discriminate the target word from noise randomly drawn from a noise distribution.\nBojanowski et al. (2016) extend word2vec using character-level information. They achieve a considerable improvement for rare words and the syntactic part of the word analogical reasoning task (Mikolov et al., 2013a). However, they fail to improve the performance for the semantic part of the task.\nOther works attempt to train word embeddings via global information (Huang et al., 2012; Pennington et al., 2014) and report improvement than the other works that use only local information. However the global information is still limited by the corpus. Some other works follow another approach that uses a lexicon or an ontology to improve the word embeddings."

      "heading" : "2.2 WORKS ON LEARNING WORD EMBEDDINGS USING LEXICONS",
      "text" : "The models proposed by Yu & Dredze (2014), and Bollegala et al. (2016) jointly learn word embeddings from a corpus and a semantic lexicon. The method proposed by Yu & Dredze (2014) called jointRCM improves word representations by maximizing the similarity of the word representations of the paraphrase pairs in the lexicon jointly with word2vec. The works by Bollegala et al. (2016) also improve the word embeddings by minimizing the distance of the word representations of related words. But they use not only the synonyms, but also the global information in corpus and other relationships such as antonyms and hypernyms.\nXu et al. (2014) propose models called R-Net and C-Net. R-Net, for a triplet of words (head, relation, tail) in a knowledge graph, minimizes the distance of the embedding vector of the tail word, from the sum of the vectors of the head word and the relation. On the other hand, C-Net makes a word less similar than the other words share the same category if the size of the category is large. They jointly train the R-Net and C-Net with skip-gram.\nFaruqui et al. (2015) concentrate on refining pre-trained word embeddings using semantic lexicons. However, as also pointed out by Bollegala et al. (2016) as incompatibilities between the corpus and the lexicon, some features extracted from the corpus that are not contained in the corpus, such as those from idioms or new words not contained in the lexicon, are improperly removed."

      "heading" : "2.3 A NOT WELL ADDRESSED TRAP IN LEARNING WORD REPRESENTATIONS USING LEXICONS",
      "text" : "In most of the previous works using lexicons to learn word representations, weight coefficients are used to control the input from the lexicon. These coefficients are manually optimized with a separated dataset. However, it cannot address the problem that the reliability of the paraphrases in a lexicon depends on different words and different contexts because a word or an utterance can have several meanings. For example, though “Terra” is the paraphrase of “Earth” in “Earth goes around the sun”, but obviously not its paraphrase in “I fill the hole with earth”."

      "heading" : "3.1 LEARNING WORD EMBEDDINGS WITH FUZZY PARAPHRASES",
      "text" : "Our method is based on two ideas. The first, if the meanings of word j and word k are ideally the same, they can replace each other in a text without changing the meaning and all the other implicit features of the text. Further, when we train word embeddings by predicating a word i by the context containing word j like word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013b;a), the probability of word i keeps unchanged in that case even though word j is replaced by word k. Henceforth, we can learn word embeddings using both a corpus and a lexicon by learning the original texts and those that some words are replaced with their paraphrases at the same time in the ideal case.\nThe second, as described in section 1 and 2, the paraphrases of a word in a lexicon are not always the paraphrases in a certain text but depend on the contexts because of polysemantic words and utterances. Henceforth, if we simply consider all the paraphrases of a word in the lexicon fully the paraphrases for the whole corpus, they deteriorate the word embeddings of some words and texts. To avoid that, we consider each paraphrase of a word in the lexicon not fully included in the paraphrase set, but a fuzzy member with a grade of membership (i.e. a degree of truth). Then we reject some paraphrases for some contexts subject to their membership.\nFor a text T , denote wi the ith word in T , c the context window, wj a word in the context window, Lwj the paraphrase set of wj in the lexicon L, wk the kth fuzzy paraphrase in Lwj , and xjk the membership of wk for wj , based on the CBOW model (Mikolov et al., 2013a) and the two ideas, we\npropose a model called continuous bag-of-fuzzy-paraphrases (CBOFP) to train word embeddings using both a corpus and a lexicon, by maximizing not only the probability of a word for a given context, but also the probability after some of the words in the context are replaced by their paraphrases randomly subject to a function of the membership of each paraphrase:\nT ∑\nwi∈T\n∑\n(i−c)≤j≤(i+c)\n\nlog p(wi|wj) +\nLwj ∑\nwk∈Lwj\nf(xjk) log p(wi|wk)\n\n (1)\nThe function f(xjk) of the membership xjk returns 1 or 0 for different paraphrases of different contexts and reduces the probabilities of the bad replacements that deteriorate the word embeddings by returning 0 more for the paraphrases that have lower grades of membership. The model can be considered as a revised CBOW model with an additional layer whose output is weighted by f(xjk) as shown in Figure 1."

      "heading" : "3.2 MEMBERSHIP ESTIMATION",
      "text" : "If we want the control function f(xjk) to reject bad replacements perfectly, f(xjk) or the membership xjk should consider all of the contexts because the similarity of the paraphrases depends on not only themselves but also the other contexts. However, it is not easy to train such a function.\nLooking for a control function that is easy to train, we notice that if two words are more often to be translated to the same word in another language, the replacement of them are less likely to change the meaning of the original sentence. Thus, we use a function of the bilingual similarity (denoted as Sjk) as the membership function without considering the other contexts:\nxjk = g(Sjk) (2)\nThere have been works about calculating the similarity of words using such bilingual information and a lexicon called the paraphrase database (PPDB) provides scores of the similarity of paraphrases (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013; Pavlick et al., 2015b;a) on the basis of bilingual features. We scale the similarity score of the paraphrase wk to [0, 1] in PPDB2.0 as the membership, and draw the values of f(xjk) from a Bernoulli distribution subject to the membership calculated in this way. Denote Sjk the similarity score of word wj and wk in PPDB2.0, the value of f(xjk) is drawn from the Bernoulli distribution:\nf(xjk) ∼ Bernoulli(xjk) (3)\nxjk = Sjk\nmax j∈T,k∈L\nSjk (4)\nWe find the control function defined above is efficient in the experiments as described later in section 4."

For word X and word Y , the different relationships of them defined in PPDB2.0 are shown in Table 1. We see that they are far more than we need as some of them are not the conventional “paraphrases” that can replace each other. Only the paraphrases of equivalence, forward entailment and reverse entailment are used in our method. For each word in the vocabulary, the paraphrases equal to it or entailed by it are put into its paraphrase set for learning. For example, denote each paraphrase in PPDB2.0 as (headword, tailword, relationship), for word A, B, C, D, E, if there are paraphrases (A,B,Equivalence), (A,C, ForwardEntailment), (D,A,ReverseEntailment), (A,E, Independent), the paraphrase set for A is (B,C,D), and E is discarded."

We also compare our method with the other works using a lexicon to improve word embeddings, which are jointRCM (Yu & Dredze, 2014), jointReps (Bollegala et al., 2016), RC-Net (Xu et al., 2014), and the method to retrofit pre-trained word embeddings using a lexicon (Marked as Retro) (Faruqui et al., 2015).\n1http://mattmahoney.net/dc/enwiki9.zip 2https://github.com/huajianjiu/Bernoulli-CBOFP\nWe used the public online available source code of word2vec3, word2vec enriched with subword information4, GloVe5, jointRCM6, jointReps7,and Retro8 to build them for the experiments.

Given a quaternion of words (wA, wB , wC , wD) that wA and wB have the similar relationship with that of wC and wD, the objective is to predict wD on the basis of wA, wB and wC . Given the word embedding vA, vB and vC for wA, wB and wC , it can be solved by finding the word whose word embedding is the closest to vB − vA + vC . The dataset is separated into two parts: the semantic part and the syntactic part. The semantic part is about analogical reasoning via semantic relationships, such as predicting the capital of a country. The syntactic part is about syntactic relationships, such as predicting the adverb form for an adjective.\nIn Table 2, we compare our method with the works using only corpus to train word embeddings. Our method gets the best overall accuracy and the best for the semantic part. For the syntactic part, our method fails to outperform the word2vec enriched with character-level subword information that is reported powerful for the syntactic part.\nIn Table 3, we compare our method with the previous works using the lexicon to improve the word embeddings. The numbers in the brackets are the differences from the accuracies achieved by the models they base on. For our method and jointRCM, it is CBOW. For jointReps, it is GloVe. For RC-Net, it is SG. For Retro, we report the results retrofitting the word embeddings trained by CBOW and SG, respectively.\n3https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/ 4https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText 5https://github.com/stanfordnlp/GloVe 6https://github.com/Gorov/JointRCM 7https://github.com/Bollegala/jointreps 8https://github.com/mfaruqui/retrofitting 9http://wacky.sslmit.unibo.it\nWe see that while the other works perform worse in the semantic part than the model they base on, ours outperform CBOW and outperform the other works in the semantic part.

Then we propose a method to avoid the trap: We treat the lexicon as a fuzzy set, approximately estimate the membership of the paraphrases, and learn word embeddings using both a corpus and a lexicon by replacing the words in the context with the paraphrases randomly subject to their grades of membership.\nBy comparison with the previous works in the word analogical reasoning task, it has been shown that our method overcomes the weakness of the previous related works in extracting the semantic features, outperforms the previous works and keeps fast.\nThe results using corpora in different sizes show that the proposed method works better with a larger corpus but less effectively with a small corpus. We are looking for another robust method to control the replacements of the paraphrases that keeps efficient for small corpora."

Thus, we propose an approach to address the problem that considers each paraphrase of a word in a lexicon not fully a paraphrase, but a fuzzy member (i.e., fuzzy paraphrase) in the paraphrase set whose degree of truth (i.e., membership) depends on the contexts. Then we propose an efficient method to use the fuzzy paraphrases to learn word embeddings. We approximately estimate the local membership of paraphrases, and train word embeddings using a lexicon jointly by replacing the words in the contexts with their paraphrases randomly subject to the membership of each paraphrase. The experimental results show that our method is efficient, overcomes the weakness of the previous related works in extracting semantic information and outperforms the previous works of learning word representations using lexicons.",
