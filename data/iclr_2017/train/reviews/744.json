{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Learning Identity Mappings with Residual Gates", "abstract": "We propose a layer augmentation technique that adds shortcut connections with a linear gating mechanism, and can be applied to almost any network model. By using a scalar parameter to control each gate, we provide a way to learn identity mappings by optimizing only one parameter. We build upon the motivation behind Highway Neural Networks and Residual Networks, where a layer is reformulated in order to make learning identity mappings less problematic to the optimizer. The augmentation introduces only one extra parameter per layer, and provides easier optimization by making degeneration into identity mappings simpler. Experimental results show that augmenting layers provides better optimization, increased performance, and more layer independence. We evaluate our method on MNIST using fully-connected networks, showing empirical indications that our augmentation facilitates the optimization of deep models, and that it provides high tolerance to full layer removal: the model retains over 90% of its performance even after half of its layers have been randomly removed. In our experiments, augmented plain networks -- which can be interpreted as simplified Highway Neural Networks -- outperform ResNets, raising new questions on how shortcut connections should be designed. We also evaluate our model on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using augmented Wide ResNets, achieving 3.65% and 18.27% test error, respectively.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "The paper presents a layer architecture where a single parameter is used to  gate the output response of layer to amplify or suppress it. It is shown that such an architecture can ease optimization of a deep network as it is easy to learn identity mappings in layers helping in better gradient propagation to lower layers (better supervision). \n\nUsing an introduced SDI metric it shown that gated residual networks can most easily learn identity mappings compared to other architectures. \n\nAlthough good theoretical reasoning is presented the observed experimental evidence of learned k values does not seem to strongly support the theory given that learned  k values are mostly very small and not varying much across layers.

This result suggests that an extensive study on different gating mechanisms for Highway Neural Networks can be extremely fruitful, once the original design is equivalent to a Highway Net with scalar gates.

The authors claim that this approach will improve the training Residual Networks.\n\nIt seems the authors could get competitive performance on CIFAR-10 to state of art models with only Wide Res Nets. Wide Gated ResNet requires much more parameters than DenseNet (and other Res Net variants) for obtaining a little improvement over Dense Net.  More importantly, the authors state that they obtained the best results on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 but the updated version of DenseNet (Huang et al. (2016b)) has new results for a version called DenseNet-BC which outperforms all of the results that authors reported (3.46 for CIFAR-10 and 17.18 for CIFAR-100 with 25.6M parameters, DenseNet-BC still outperforms with 15.3M parameters which is much less that 36.5M). The Res Net variants papers with state of art results report result for Image Net. Therefore the empirical results need also the Image Net to demonstrate that improvement claimed is achieved.\n\nThe proposed trick adopts Highway Neural Networks and Residual Networks with an intuitive motivation. It is not sufficiently novel and the empirical results do not prove sufficient effectiveness of this incremental approach.\n\n", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 5, "DATE": "20 Dec 2016 (modified: 23 Jan 2017)", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 5}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer3", "TITLE": "A simple gating mechanism", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "This paper proposes to learn a single scalar gating parameter instead of a full gating tensor in highway networks. The claim is that such gating is easier to learn and allows a network to flexibly utilize computation.\n\nThe basic idea of the paper is simple and is clearly presented. It is a natural simplification of highway networks to allow easily \"shutting off\" layers while keeping number of additional parameters low. However, in this regard the paper leaves out a few key points. Firstly, it does not mention that the gates in highway networks are data-dependent which is potentially more powerful than learning a fixed gate for all units and independent of data. Secondly, it does not do a fair comparison with highway networks to show that this simpler formulation is indeed easier to learn.\n\nDid the authors try their original design of u = g(k)f(x) + (1 - g(k))x where f(x) is a plain layer instead of a residual layer? Based on the arguments made in the paper, this should work fine. Why wasn't it tested? If it doesn't work, are the arguments incorrect or incomplete?\n\nFor the MNIST experiments, since the hyperparameters are fixed, the plots are misleading if any dependence on hyperparameters exists for the different models. This experiment appears to be based on Srivastava et al (2015). If it is indeed designed to test optimization at aggressive depths, then apart from doing a hyperparameter search, the authors should not use regularization such as dropout or batch norm, which do not appear in the theoretical arguments for the architecture.\n\nFor CIFAR experiments, the obtained improvements compared to the baseline (wide resnets) are very small and therefore it is important to report the standard deviations (or all results) in both cases. It's not clear that the differences are significant.\n\nSome questions regarding g(): Was g() always ReLU? Doesn't this have potential problems with g(k) becoming 0 and never recovering? Does this also mean that for the wide resnet in Fig 7, most residual blocks are zeroed out since k < 0?", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 5, "DATE": "17 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 5}, {"TITLE": "Revision", "OTHER_KEYS": "Pedro Savarese", "comments": "In the recent revisions of our work, we have performed the following main changes:\n\n- Run complex models on CIFAR-10 and on CIFAR-100, achieving 3.65% and 18.27% test error, respectively.
