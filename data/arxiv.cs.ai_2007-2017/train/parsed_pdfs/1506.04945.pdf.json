      "text" : "paradigm aimed at (declaratively) specifying and solving real-world problems related to geometric and qualitative spatial representation and reasoning [4]. A particular manifestation of this paradigm is the constraint logic programming based CLP(QS) spatial reasoning system [4, 33, 34] (Section 2).\n. Relational Algebraic Qualitative Spatial Reasoning The state of the art in qualitative spatial reasoning using relational algebraic methods [24] has resulted in prototypical algorithms and black-box systems that do not integrate with KR languages, such as those dealing with semantics and conceptual knowledge necessary for handling background knowledge, action & change, relational learning, rule-based systems etc. Furthermore, relation algebraic qualitative spatial reasoning (e.g. LR [25]), while efficient, is incomplete in general [22, 23, 24].4 Alternatively, constraint logic programming based systems such as CLP(QS) [4] and others (see [9, 10, 18, 20, 28, 29]) adopt an analytic geometry approach where spatial relations are encoded as systems of polynomial constraints;5 while these methods are sound and complete (see Section 2.2), they have prohibitive computational complexity, O(cc n 2\n1 ) in the number of polynomial variables n, meaning that even relatively simple problems are not solved within a practical amount of time via “naive” or direct encodings as polynomial constraints, i.e. encodings that lack common-sense knowledge about spatial objects and relations. On the other hand, highly efficient and specialised geometric theorem provers (e.g. [12]) and geometric constraint solvers (e.g. [17, 27]) exist. However, these provers exhibit highly specialised and restricted spatial languages6 and lack (a) the direct integration with more general AI methods and (b) the capacity for incorporating modular common-sense rules about space in an extensible domain- and context-specific manner. The aims and contributions of the research presented in this paper are two-fold:\n1. to further develop a KR-centered declarative spatial reasoning paradigm such that spatial reasoning capabilities are available and accessible within AI programs and applications areas, and may be seamlessly integrated with other AI methods dealing with representation, reasoning, and learning about non-spatial aspects\n4 Incompleteness refers to the inability of a spatial reasoning method to determine whether a given network of qualitative spatial constraints is consistent or inconsistent in general. Relation-algebraic spatial reasoning (i.e. using algebraic closure based on weak composition) has been shown to be incomplete for a number of spatial languages and cannot guarantee consistency in general, e.g. relative directions [23] and containment relations between linearly ordered intervals [22], Theorem 5.9. 5 We emphasise that this analytic geometry approach that we also adopt is not qualitative spatial reasoning in the relation algebraic sense; the foundations are similar (i.e. employing a finite language of spatial relations that are interpreted as infinite sets of configurations, determining consistency in the complete absence of numeric information, and so on) but the methods for determining consistency etc. come from different branches of spatial reasoning. 6 Standard geometric constraint languages of approaches including [12, 17, 27] consist of points, lines, circles, ellipses, and coincidence, tangency, perpendicularity, parallelism, and numerical dimension constraints; note the absence of e.g. mereotopology and “common-sense” relative orientation relations [35].\nSpatial Symmetry Driven Pruning 3\n2. to demonstrate that in spite of high computational complexity in a general and domain-independent case, the power of analytic geometric —in particular polynomial systems for encoding the semantics of spatial relations– can be exploited by systematically utilising commonsense knowledge about spatial object and relationships at the qualitative level.\nWe present a new algorithm that drastically improves analytic spatial reasoning performance within KR-based declarative spatial reasoning approaches by identifying and pruning spatial symmetries that form equivalence classes (based on affine transformations) at the qualitative spatial level. By exploiting symmetries our approach utilises powerful underlying, but computationally expensive, polynomial solvers in a significantly more effective manner. Our algorithm is simple to implement, and enables spatial reasoners to solve problems that are otherwise unsolvable using analytic or relation algebraic methods. We emphasise that our approach is independent of any particular polynomial constraint solver; it can be similarly applied over a range of solvers such as CLP(R), SMTs, and specialised geometric constraint solvers that have been integrated into a KR framework. In addition to AI / commonsense reasoning applications areas such as design, GIS, vision, robotics [3, 5, 6, 7], we also address application into automating support for proving the validity of theorems in mereotopology, orientation, shape, etc. (e.g. [8, 36]). Building on such foundational capabilities, another outreach is in the area of computer-aided learning systems in mathematics (e.g. at a highschool level). For instance, consider Proposition 9, Book I of Euclid’s Elements, where the task is to bisect an angle using only an unmarked ruler and collapsable compass. Once a student has developed what they believe to be a constructive proof, they can employ declarative spatial reasoners to formally verify that their construction applies to all possible inputs (i.e. all possible angles) and manipulate an interactive sketch that maintains the specified spatial relations (i.e. dynamic geometry [17]). A further area of interest is verifying the entries of composition tables that are used in relation algebraic qualitative spatial reasoning [30]: given spatial objects a, b, c ∈ U , composition “look up” tables are indexed by pairs of (base) relations R1ab , R2bc and return disjunctions of possible (base) relations R3ac . For each entry, the task is to prove ∃a, b, c ∈ U ( R1ab ∧ R2bc ∧ R3ac ) for only those base relations R3 in the entry’s disjunction."

      "text" : "With a focus on spatial question-answering, the CLP(QS) spatial reasoning system [4, 33, 34] provides a practical manifestation of certain aspects of the declarative spatial reasoning paradigm in the context of constraint logic programming (CLP). 7 CLP(QS) utilises a high-level language of spatial relations and commonsense knowledge about how various spatial domains behave. Such relations describe sets of object configurations, i.e. qualitative spatial relations such as coincident, left of, or partially overlapping. Through this deep integration of spatial reasoning with KR-based frameworks, the long-term research agenda is to seamlessly provide spatial reasoning in other AI tasks such as planning, non-monotonic reasoning, and ontological reasoning [4]. What follows is a brief illustration of the spatial Q/A capability supported by CLP(QS). EXAMPLE A. Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) Grade 3 Mathematics (2009), Question 12. Put a square and two rightangled triangles together to make a rectangle. (1) Put the shapes T1, T2, S illustrated in Figure 1(d) together to make a rectangle. (2) Put the shapes T1, T2, S in Figure 1(d) together to make a quadrilateral that is not a rectangle. CLP(QS) represents right-angle triangles as illustrated in Figure 1(b). Figures 1(a) and 1(c) present the CLP(QS) solutions.\nGrade 3 Mathematics (2013), Question 17. (1) How many copies of T1 illustrated in Figure 1(d) are needed to completely fill the region R illustrated in Figure 2(a) without any of them overlapping? As presented in Figure 2, CLP(QS) solves both the geometric definition and a variation where the dimensions of the rectangle and triangles are not given. EXAMPLE B. Qualitative Spatial Reasoning with Complete Unknowns In this example CLP(QS) reasons about spatial objects based solely on given qualitative spatial relations, i.e. without any geometric information. Define three cubes A,B,C. Put B inside A, and make B disconnected from C. What spatial relations can possibly hold between A and C? CLP(QS) determines that A must be disconnected from C and provides the inferred corresponding geometric constraints, as illustrated in Figure 3."

Specifically, the system of polynomial (in)equalities over variablesX is satisfiable if there exists a real number assignment for each x ∈ X such that the (in)equalities are true. Partial geometric information (i.e. a combination of numerical and qualitative spatial information) is utilised by assigning the given real numerical values to the corresponding object parameters. Thus, we can integrate spatial reasoning and logic programming using Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) [19]; this system is called CLP over qualitative spatial domains. CLP(QS), provides a suitable framework for expressing a d proving first-order spatial theorems. Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) [13] is a prominent sound and complete algorithm for deciding satisfiability of a general system of polynomial constraints over reals and has time complexity O(cc n 2\n1 ) in th number of free variables [2]. Thus, a key focus within analytic spatial reasoning has been methods for managing this inherent intractibility.8 More efficient refinements of the original CAD algorithm include partial CAD [14]. Symbolic methods for solving systems of multivariate equations include the Gröbner basis method [11] and Wu’s characteristic set method [40]. In the QUAD-CLP(R) system, the authors improve solving performance by using linear approximations of quadratic constraints and by identifying geometric equivalence classes [28]. Ratschan employs pruning methods, also at the polynomial level, in the rsolve system [31, 32].\n8 Important factors in determining the applicability of various analytic approaches are the degree of the polynomials (particularly the distinction between linear and nonlinear) and whether both equality and inequalities are permitted in the constraints.\nSpatial Symmetry Driven Pruning 7\nConstructive and iterative (i.e. Newton and Quasi-Newton iteration) methods solve spatial reasoning problems by “building” a solution, i.e. by finding a configuration that satisfies the given constraints [27]. If a solution is found, then the solution itself is the proof that the system is consistent – but what if a solution is not found within a given time frame? In general these methods are incomplete for spatial reasoning problems encoded as nonlinear equations and inequalities of arbitrary degree.9"

      "text" : "Information about objects and their spatial relations is formally expressed as a constraint graph G = (N,E), where the nodes N of the graph are spatial objects and the edges between nodes specify the relations between the objects. Objects belong to a domain, e.g. points, lines, squares, and circles in 2D Euclidean space, and cuboids, vertically-extruded polygons, spheres, and cylinders in 3D Euclidean space. We denote the object domain of node i as Ui (spatial domains are typically infinite). A node may refer to a partially ground, or completely geometrically ground object, such that Ui can be a proper subset of the full domain of that object type. Each element i′ ∈ Ui is called an instance of that object domain. A configuration of objects is a set of instances {i′1, . . . , i′n} of nodes i1, . . . , in respectively. A binary relation Rij between nodes i, j distinguishes a set of relative configurations of i, j; relation R is said to hold for those configurations, Rij ⊆ Ui×Uj . In general, an n-ary relation for n ≥ 1 distinguishes a set of configurations between n objects: Ri1,...,in ⊆ Ui1 × · · · × Uin . An edge between nodes i, j is assigned a logical formula over relation symbols R1, . . . , Rm and logical operators ∨,∧,¬. Given an interpretation i′, j′, the formula for edge e is interpreted in the standard way, denoted e(i′, j′):\n– R1 ≡ (i′, j′) ∈ R1ij – (R1 ∨R2) ≡ (i′, j′) ∈ R1ij ∪R2ij – (R1 ∧R2) ≡ (i′, j′) ∈ R1ij ∩R2ij – (¬R1) ≡ (i′, j′) ∈ (Ui × Uj) \\R1ij\nAn edge between i, j is satisfied by a configuration i′, j′ if e(i′, j′) is true (this is generalised to n-ary relations). A spatial constraint graph G = (N,E) is consistent or satisfiable if there exists a configuration s of N that satisfies all edges in E, denoted G(s); this is referred to as the consistency task. Graph G′ is a consequence of, or implied by, G if every spatial configuration that satisfies G also satisfies G′. This is the sufficiency task (or entailment) that we commonly apply to constructive proofs, where the task is to prove that objects and relations in G are sufficient for ensuring that particular properties hold in G′. Given graph G, two key questions are (1) how to give meaning, or interpret, the spatial relations in G, and (2) how to efficiently determine consistency and produce instantiations of G. That is, we need to adopt a method for spatial reasoning. 9 That is, constructive methods may fail in building a consistent solution, and iterative root finding methods may fail to converge."

      "text" : "A key insight is that spatial configurations form equivalence classes over qualitative relationships based on certain affine transformations. For example, consider the spatial task of determining whether five same-sized spheres can be mutually touching. Suppose we are given a specific numerically defined configuration of four mutually touching spheres as illustrated in Figure 4(a), and we prove that it is impossible to add an additional mutually touching sphere to this configuration. That is, let s1, . . . , s4 be unit spheres (radius 1), centred on points p1 = (0, 0, 0), p2 = (2, 0, 0), p3 = (1, √ 3, 0), p4 = (1, √ 1 3 , √ 8 3 ), respectively. According to Equation 1, s1, . . . , s4 are mutually touching. We prove that a fifth same-sized, mutually touching sphere cannot be added to this configuration by determining that the corresponding system of polynomial constraints is unsatisfiable (the system consists of four constraints with three free variables xs5 , ys5 , zs5 , by reapplying Equation 1 between s5 and each other sphere, e.g. s1 touches s5 is x2s5 + y 2 s5 + z 2 s5 = 4).\nNow consider that we apply an affine transformation to the original configuration such as rotation, translation, scaling, or reflection, as illustrated in Figures 4(b) and 4(c). After having applied the transformation, it is still impossible to add a fifth mutually touching sphere, because the relevant qualitative (topological) relations are preserved under these transformations. Thus, when we proved that it was impossible to add a fifth same-sized mutually touching sphere to the original given configuration, in fact we proved it for a class of configurations, specifically, the class of configurations that can be reached by applying an affine transformation to the original configuration. Now, when determining consistency of graphs of qualitative spatial relations, we are not given any specific spatial configurations to work with (i.e. complete absence of numerical information), and instead need to prove consistency over all possible configurations. The key is that, each time we ground and constrain variables, we are eliminating a spatial symmetry from our partially defined configuration. If we maintain knowledge about symmetries that certain object types have (e.g. spheres have complete rotational symmetry) then we can judiciously “trade” symmetries for unbound variables in our polynomial encoding at a purely symbolic level. Importantly, rather than having to compute symmetries or undertake any complex symmetry detection procedure, we are instead building knowledge about space and spatial properties of objects into the spatial solver at a declarative level. Thus, we are able to efficiently reason over an infinite set of possible configurations by incrementally pruning spatial symmetries based on commonsense\nSpatial Symmetry Driven Pruning 9\nknowledge about space, and this pruning is exploited by eliminating and constraining variables in the underlying polynomial encoding."

A fundamental property of affine transformations is that they preserve (a) point coincidence (e.g. line intersections), (b) parallelism between straight lines, and (c) proportions of distances between points on parallel lines [26]. For example, consider the configuration of points pa, pb, pc, pd and lines l1, l2, l3 in Figure 5: (a) we cannot introduce new points of coincidence between lines by applying transformations such as translation, scaling, reflection, and rotation.

      "text" : "Theorem 1 The following qualitative spatial relations are preserved under translation, scale, rotation, and reflection (applied to the embedding space): topology, mereology, coincidence, collinearity, line parallelism.\nProof. By definition, affine transformations preserve parallelism with respect to qualitative line orientation, and point coincidence. Due to preservation of point coincidence and proportions of collinear distances by affine transformations, it follows that mereological part of and topological contact relations between regions are preserved, i.e. if a mereological or topological relation changes between regions a, b, then by definition there exists a point p coincident with a such that the coincidence relation between p and b has changed; but this cannot occur as point coincidence is maintained with affine transformations by definition, therefore mereological and topological relations are also maintained.\nThe interaction between spatial relations and transformations is richer than we have space to elaborate on here, i.e. not all qualitative spatial relations are preserved under all affine transformations; orientation is not preserved under reflection (e.g. Figure 5(b) gives a counter example), distance is not preserved under non-uniform scaling. To summarise, we formalise the following knowledge as modular commonsense rules in CLP(QS): point-coincidence, line parallelism, topological and mereological relations are preserved with all affine transformations. Relative orientation changes with reflection, and qualitative distances and perpendicularity change with non-uniform scaling. Spheres, circles, and rectangles are not preserved with non-uniform scaling, with the exception of axisaligned bounding boxes.\n“Trading” Transformations Symmetries are used to eliminate object variables. As a metaphor, unbound variables are replaced by constant values in “exchange” for transformations. We start with a set of transformations that can be applied to a configuration: translation, scaling, arbitrary rotation, and horizontal and vertical reflection. We can then “trade” each transformation for an elimination of variables. Each transformation can only be “spent” once. Theorem 2 presents an instance of such a pruning case. Table 2 presents a variety of different pruning cases for position variables and the associated combination of transformations, as illustrated in Figure 6.11 Some cases require more than one distinct set of parameter restrictions to cover the set of all position variables due to point coincidence being preserved by affine transformations. For example, consider case (f): all pairs of points p1, p2 can be transformed into any other pair of points pi, pj by translation, rotation, and scaling, iff p1 = p2 ↔ pi = pj . Thus, to cover all pairs of possible points, we need to consider two distinct parameter restrictions: pi = pj and pi 6= pj ; we refer to these as subcases. Many further pruning cases are identifiable. For example, a version of case (i) can be defined without reflection by requiring more sub-cases where c4 > c2 and c4 < c2. Case (i) can be extended so that all six coordinates of three points are grounded if we also “exchange” the skew transformation (e.g. applicable to object domains like triangles or points). 11 All cases have been verified using Reduce as presented in Theorem 2.\nSpatial Symmetry Driven Pruning 13\nTheorem 2 Any pair of object position variables (x1, y1), (x2, y2) can be transformed into any given position constants (c1, c2), (c3, c2) such that (c1 = c3 ↔ (x1 = x2 ∧ y1 = y2)) by applying: an xy-translation, a rotation about the origin in the range (0, 2π), and an x-scale.\nProof. The corresponding expression has been verified using the Reduce system (Redlog quantifier elimination) [15]; all variables are quantified over reals. ∀c1∀c2∀c3∀x1∀y1∀x2∀y2 (c1 = c3 ↔ (x1 = x2 ∧ y1 = y2))↔ ∃tx∃ty∃dx∃dy∃sx\n( (0 < sx) ∧ (d2x + d2y = 1) ∧ letS = ( sx 0 0 1 ) ∧ letR = ( dx − dy dy dx ) ∧ letT = ( tx ty ) ∧(\nc1 c2\n) = SR ( x1 y1 ) + T ∧ ( c3 c2 ) = SR ( x2 y2 ) + T ) ≡ >\nWe can use this pruning case on any spatial constraint graph G where the graph’s spatial relations are preserved by translation, rotation, and scaling. Given graph G = (N,E), the following Algorithm applies the pruning case, with selected constants c1 = 0, c2 = 0, and c3 = 1 or c3 = 0:\n1. select object position variables p1, p2 from nodes in N 2. copy G to create G1, G2 3. in G1 set p1 = (0, 0), p2 = (1, 0) (case c1 6= c3) 4. in G2 set p1 = (0, 0), p2 = (0, 0) (case c1 = c3) 5. if the task is:\n(a) consistency of G then solve ∨2 i=1 ∃s Gi(s)\n(b) sufficiency, G→ G′, then solve∧2 i=1 ¬∃s(Gi(s) ∧ ¬G′(s))\nIn Step 1 any pair of objects can be selected for which their position variables will be grounded; we also employ policies that target computationally costly subgraphs (for example, pairs of non-equal circles that share a boundary point are often good candidates for this pruning case). Having eliminated free variables from the system of polynomial constraints, the constraints are significantly more simple to solve. Due to the double exponential complexity O(cc n 2\n1 ) reducing n has a significant impact on performance; the system may even collapse from nonlinear constraints to linear (solvable in O(cn)) or constants."

Cases for pruning position parameters.\nIn such cases we can reapply spatial symmetry pruning in each independent sub-graph; this commonsense spatial knowledge is modularly formalised within CLP(QS). For example, consider Proposition 22 of Book I of Euclid’s Elements (Figure 7):\nConstructing a triangle from three segments. Given three line segments lab, lcd, lef , draw a line through four collinear points p1, . . . , p4 such that |(p1, p2)| = |lab|, |(p2, p3)| = |lcd|, |(p3, p4)| = |lef |. Draw circle ca centred on p2, coincident with p1. Draw circle cb centred on p3 coincident with p4. Draw p5 coincident with ca and cb. The triangle p2, p3, p5 has side lengths such that |(p2, p3)| = |lcd|, |(p3, p5)| = |lef |, |(p5, p2)| = |lab|.\nIn this example, the three segments lab, lcd, lef and the remaining objects are only related by the distances between their end points. That is, the relative position and orientation of lab, lcd, lef is not relevant to the consistency of the spatial graph; we only need to explore all combinations of segment lengths. Thus the solver decomposes the graph into four sub-graphs: (1) lab (2) lcd (3) lef , and (4) p1, . . . , p5, ca, cb. In subgraphs (1),(2),(3) it “trades” translation and rotation to ground pa = pc = pe = (0, 0), and yb = yd = yf = 0 and keeps x-scale to cover all possible combinations of segment lengths, i.e. xb, xd, xf are free variables. In subgraph (4) CLP(QS) applies the pruning case of Theorem 2 by grounding p1, p4.\nSpatial Symmetry Driven Pruning 15\nCase Parameter restrictions Traded transformations a x1 = c1 x-translate b x1 = c1, y1 = c2 xy-translate c x1 = c1, x2 = c2, (i) c1 6= c2 (ii) c1 = c2 x-translate, rotate π, x-scale d x1 = c1, y2 = c2 xy-translate e x1 = c1, y1 = c2, x2 = c3, xy-translate, rotate π, x-scale\n(i) c1 6= c3 (ii) c1 = c3 f x1 = c1, y1 = c2, x2 = c3, y2 = c2, xy-translate, rotate (0, 2π), x-scale\n(i) c1 6= c3 (ii) c1 = c3 g x1 = c1, x2 = c2, y3 = c3 xy-translate, rotate π, x-scale\n(i) c1 6= c2 (ii) c1 = c2 h ∗ x1 = c1, y1 = c2, x2 = c3, y3 = c4 xy-translate, rotate π, xy-scale,\n(i) c1 6= c3 ∧ c2 6= c4 (ii) c1 = c3 ∧ c2 6= c4 y-reflect (iii) c1 6= c3 ∧ c2 = c4 (iv) c1 = c3 ∧ c2 = c4\ni ∗ x1 = c1, y1 = c2, x2 = c3, y2 = c2, y3 = c4 xy-translate, rotate (0, 2π), xy-scale, (i) c1 6= c3 ∧ c2 6= c4 (ii) c1 6= c3 ∧ c2 = c4 y-reflect (iii) c1 = c3 ∧ c2 = c4\nTable 2.

To summarise, we formalise the following knowledge as modular commonsense rules in CLP(QS): point-coincidence, line parallelism, topological and mereological relations are preserved with all affine transformations. Relative orientation changes with reflection, and qualitative distances and perpendicularity change with non-uniform scaling. Spheres, circles, and rectangles are not preserved with non-uniform scaling, with the exception of axis-aligned bounding boxes. Our algorithm is simple to implement, and is easily extended to handle more pruning cases. Theoretical and empirical results show that our method of pruning yields an improvement in performance by orders of magnitude over standard polynomial encodings without loss of soundness, thus increasing the horizon of spatial problems solvable with any polynomial constraint solver. Furthermore, the declaratively formalised knowledge about pruning strategies is available to be utilised in"

    "abstractText" : "Declarative spatial reasoning denotes the ability to (declaratively) specify and solve real-world problems related to geometric and qualitative spatial representation and reasoning within standard knowledge representation and reasoning (KR) based methods (e.g., logic programming and derivatives). One approach for encoding the semantics of spatial relations within a declarative programming framework is by systems of polynomial constraints. However, solving such constraints is computationally intractable in general (i.e. the theory of real-closed fields). We present a new algorithm, implemented within the declarative spatial reasoning system CLP(QS), that drastically improves the performance of deciding the consistency of spatial constraint graphs over conventional polynomial encodings. We develop pruning strategies founded on spatial symmetries that form equivalence classes (based on affine transformations) at the qualitative spatial level. Moreover, pruning strategies are themselves formalised as knowledge about the properties of space and spatial symmetries. We evaluate our algorithm using a range of benchmarks in the class of contact problems, and proofs in mereology and geometry. The empirical results show that CLP(QS) with knowledgebased spatial pruning outperforms conventional polynomial encodings by orders of magnitude, and can thus be applied to problems that are otherwise unsolvable in practice.",
