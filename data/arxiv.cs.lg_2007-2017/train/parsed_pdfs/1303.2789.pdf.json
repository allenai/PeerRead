Although femtocells offer significant benefits to both the operator and the user, several challenges have to be solved to fully reap these benefits. One of the most daunting challenges is their interference on macro-users and other femtocells [1], [2]. Typically, femtocells are installed by the end user and hence, their number and positions are random and unknown to the network operator a priori. Adding to this the typical dynamics of the wireless environment, a centralized approach to handle the interference problem can not be feasible which, in turn, calls for a distributed interference management strategies.\nBased on these observations, in this paper, we focus on closed access femtocells [3] working in the same bandwidth with macrocells (i.e. cognitive femtocells), where the femtocells will be the secondary users who try to perform power control to maximize their own performance while maintain the macrocell capacity at certain level. In order to handle the interference generated by the femtocells on the macrocell users, we will use a distributed reinforcement learning [4] technique called multi-agent Q-learning [5] and [6]. In our\ncontext, a prior model of the environment cannot be achieved due to 1) the unplanned placement of the femtocells, 2) the typical dynamics of the wireless enshrinement. In such context, Q-Learning offers significant advantages to achieve optimal decision policies through realtime learning of the environment [7].\nIn the literature, Q-learning has been used several times to perform power allocation in femtocell networks. In [8], authors used independent learning (IL) Q-learning to perform power allocation in order to control the interference generated by the femtocells on the macrocell user. In [7], authors introduced a new concept called docitive femtocells where a new femtocell can fasten its learning process by learning the policies acquired by the already deployed femtocells, instead of learning from scratch. The policies are shared by Q-table exchange between the femtocells. However, after the Q-tables are exchanged, all the femtocells take their actions (powers) independently, which may generate an oscillating behavior in the system. In [9], we developed a distributed power allocation algorithm called distributed power control using Q-learning (DPC-Q). In DPC-Q, two different learning paradigms were proposed: independent learning (IL) and cooperative learning (CL). It was shown that both paradigms achieves convergence. Moreover, the CL paradigm outperforms the IL one through achieving higher aggregate femtocells capacity and better fairness (in terms of capacity) among the learning femtocells.\nHowever, in [9] we did not evaluate the performance of DPC-Q against the networks dynamics, specially after convergence. Also, we did not have any benchmarking algorithm to compare the performance of DPC-Q to. Thus, the contribution of this paper can be summed up as follows:\n• we propose two new Q-learning based power allocation algorithms: namely, centralized power control using Qlearning (CPC-Q) and partially distributed power control using Q-learning (PDPC-Q). CPC-Q is used for benchmarking purposes, where a central controller, which has all the information about the system (channel gains of all femtocells, system noise, · · · ), is responsible for calculating the optimal powers that the femtocells should use. PDPC-Q, which is an agent based power control algorithm, is proposed as: 1) it gives the operator the flexibility to work on a global base (e.g. aggregate femtocell capacity instead of subcarrier based femtocell\ncapacity as in DPC-Q), 2) it makes DPC-Q comparable to CPC-Q. • we evaluate the robustness and scalability of DPC-Q, in both IL and CL paradigms, against two of the dynamics that typically exist in the wireless environment: namely, the random activity of femtocells (when new femtocells are deployed in the system during the learning process) and the density of the femtocells in the macrocell coverage area (the number of femtocells that are interfering on the macro users). • we compare our proposed DPC-Q in both IL and CL paradigms to the idea of docitive femtocells presented in [7].\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section II, the system model is described. Section III presents a brief background about multi-agent Q-learning. In section IV, the proposed Q-learning based power allocation algorithms are presented. The simulation scenario and the results are discussed in section V. Finally the conclusions are drawn in section VI."

      "text" : "The scenario of distributed cognitive femtocells can be mathematically formulated using stochastic games [10], where the learning process of each femtocell is described by a task defined by the quintuple {N,S,A, P,R(s,~a)}, where:\n• N = {1, 2, · · · , Nf} is the set of agents (i.e. femtocells). • S = {s1, s2, · · · , sm} is the set of possible states that\neach agent can occupy, where m is the number of possible states. • A = {a1, a2, · · · , al} is the set of possible actions that each agent can perform for each task, where l is the number of possible actions. • P is the probabilistic transition function that defines the probability that an agent transits from one state to another, given the joint action performed by all agents. • R(s,~a) is the reward function that determines the reward fed back to an agent n by the environment when the joint action ~a is performed in state s ∈ S.\nIn the distributed cognitive femtocells scenario, P can not be deduced due to the dynamics of the wireless environment. Thus, one of the most famous techniques that calculates optimal policies without any prior model of the environment is Q-learning . Q-learning assigns each task of each agent a Q-table whose entries are known as Q-values Q(sm, al), for each state sm ∈ S and action al ∈ A. Thus, the dimension of this table is m × l. The Q-value Q(sm, al) is defined to be the expected discounted reward over an infinite time when action al is performed in state sm, and an optimal policy is followed thereafter [5]. The learning process of each agent n at time t can be described as follows: 1) the agent senses the environment and observes its current state snm ∈ S, 2) based on snm, the agent selects its action a n l randomly with probability ǫ or according to: anl = argmaxa∈A Q t n(s n m, a) with probability 1− ǫ, where Qtn(sm, a) is the row of the Qtable of agent n that corresponds to state snm at time t, and ǫ is an exploration parameter (a random number) that guarantees that all the state-action pairs of the Q-table is visited at least once, 3) the environment makes a transition to a new state snm′ ∈ S and the agent receives a reward r t n = R(s n m,~a) due to this transition, 4) the Q-value is updated using equation 3 and the process is repeated.\nQt+1n (s n m, a n l ) :=(1− α)Q t n(s n m, a n l )+\nα(rtn + γmax a ′∈A Qtn(s n m′ , a\n′ )) (3)\nwhere α is called the learning rate and 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1 is the discount factor that determines how much effect the future rewards have on the decisions at each moment. It should be noticed that the reward rtn depends on the joint action ~a of all agents not on the individual action al. This is the main difference between the multi-agent scenario described here and the single-agent one (when Nf = 1). In the single-agent case, one of the conditions needed to guarantee that the Qvalues converges to the optimal ones is that: the reward of the\nagent must be dependent only on its individual actions (i.e. the reward function is stationary for each state-action pair) [5], [11]. However, for the multi-agent scenario, the reward function is not stationary from the agent point of view, since it now depends on the actions of other agents. Thus, the convergence proof used for the single-agent case can not be used in the multi-agent one."

      "text" : "DPC-Q is a distributed algorithm where multiple agents (i.e: femtocells) aim at learning a sub-optimal decision policy (i.e: power allocation) by repeatedly interacting with the environment. The DPC-Q algorithm is proposed in two different learning paradigms:\n• Independent learning (IL): In this paradigm, each agent learns independently from other agents (i.e: ignores other agents’ actions and considers other agents as part of the environment). Although, this may lead to oscillations and convergence problems, the IL paradigm showed good results in many applications [8]. • Cooperative learning (CL): In this paradigm, each agent shares a portion of its Q-table with all other cooperating agents1, aiming at enhancing the femtocells’ performance. CL is performed as follows: each agent shares the row of its Q-table that corresponds to its current state with all other cooperating agents (i.e. femtocells in the same range). Then, each agent n selects its action anl according to the following equation:\nanl = argmax a∈A\n( ∑\n1≤n′≤Nf\nQn′(s n′ , a)) (4)\nThe main idea behind this strategy is explained in details in [9]. In terms of overhead, if the number of femtocells is Nf , then the total overhead needed is Nf .(Nf − 1) messages (each of size l) per unit time (i.e. the overhead is quadratic in the number of cooperating femtocells).\nDPC-Q is an agent and subcarrier based algorithm (i.e. the capacities, states, actions, reward functions are defined for each agent over each subcarrier) [9]:\n• Agents: FBSn, ∀1 ≤ n ≤ Nf • States: At time t for femtocell n on subcarrier k, the\nstate is defined as: sn,kt = {I k t ,P n t } where I k t ∈ {0, 1} indicates the level of interference measured at the macrouser on subcarrier k at time t:\nIkt =\n{\n1, C (k) o < Γo 0, C (k) o ≥ Γo\n(5)\nwhere Γo is the target capacity determining the QoS performance of the macrocell. We assume that the macrocell\n1We assume that the shared row of the Q-table is put in the control bits of the packets transmitted between the femtocells. The details of the exact protocol lie out of the scope of this paper.\nreports the value of C(k)o to all FBSs through the backhaul connection. Pnt defines the power levels used to quantize the total power FBS n is using for transmission at time t:\nPnt =\n\n \n \n0, ∑K k=0 p n,k t < (P f max −A1) 1, (P fmax −A2) ≤ ∑K k=0 p n,k t ≤ P f max 2, ∑K\nk=0 p n,k t > P f max\n(6)\nwhere A1 and A2 are arbitrary selected thresholds (several values for A1 and A2 as well as more power levels were tried through the simulations and the performance gain between these values was marginal). • Actions: The action here is scalar, where the set of actions available for each FBS is defined as the set of possible powers that a FBS can use for transmission on each subcarrier. In the simulations, a range from −20 to P fmax dBm with step of 2 dBm is used. • Reward Functions: The reward fed back to agent n on subcarrier k at time t is defined as:\nr n,k t =\n{\ne−(C (k) o −Γ o)2 − e−C (k) n , ∑K k=0 p n,k t ≤ P f max −2, ∑K\nk=0 p n,k t > P f max\n(7) The rationale behind this reward function is that each femtocell will aim at maximizing its own capacity while: 1) maintaining the capacity of the macrocell around the target capacity Γo (convergence is assumed to be within a range of ±1 bits/sec/Hz from Γo), 2) not exceeding the allowed P fmax. This reward function was compared to the reward function defined in [9]:\nr n,k t =\n{\ne−(C (k) o −Γ o)2 , ∑K k=0 p n,k t ≤ P f max −1, ∑K\nk=0 p n,k t > P f max\n(8)\nwhere it was shown that both reward functions maintain the capacity of the macrocell within the convergence range. However, reward function 7 was able to achieve higher aggregate femtocell capacity. In this paper, we show another advantage for reward function 7, which is: it learns (explores or reacts to network dynamics) better than reward function 8 even when the exploration parameter ǫ is not used. This mainly depends on the initial value of the Q-values. In this paper, we initially set all the Q-values to zero. Thus, when ǫ is not used, using reward function 8 will always feed the agent back with a positive reward (given that P fmax is not exceeded). Thus, if initially agent n was in state sn,kt on subcarrier k and took action pn,kt , the Q-value of this action Qn(s\nn,k, pn,k) will be updated using a positive valued reward, thus this Q-value will increase with time, and agent n will keep using the same action forever (since the action is chosen according to the maximum Q-value). Thus, using ǫ with reward function 8 is a must to have better exploration behavior. On the other hand, using reward function 7 may feed the agent back with positive or negative valued rewards (e−(C (k) o −Γ o)2 could be smaller than e−C (k) n ). Thus, given the same initial conditions, agent n could\nreceive a negative valued reward after taking action pn,kt , leading to the decrease of its Q-value with time. Once the Q-value decreases below zero, the agent will take another action whose Q-value is greater than the decreased one. Thus, reward function 7 learns (explores) better than reward function 8.\nIn this paper, we also evaluate the robustness and scalability of DPC-Q, in both IL and CL paradigms. We believe that the CL paradigm is much more robust and scalable against the network dynamics compared to the IL paradigm. The reason is that after sharing the row of the Q-table, each femtocell will know the states that all other cooperating femtocells are occupying, and since a state at a certain moment can be defined as: how the agent sees the environment at that moment, each femtocell can implicitly know 1) how all other femtocells can react to the network dynamics, 2) what actions other femtocells are going to take. However, if the femtocells took their actions independently (i.e. IL paradigm), even after knowing the states of each other, oscillating behaviors that may not reach convergence may be generated. One way to overcome this problem is to force the femtocells to make use of the information shared while taking their actions (i.e. taking the actions cooperatively: equation 4). This could decrease the oscillations in the system, making the femtocells more robust towards the increase of the number of deployed femtocells, and towards the sudden effect caused by any new deployed femtocell."

      "heading" : "B. Numerical Results",
      "text" : "Figure 1(a) shows the aggregate femtocells capacity (as a function of the number of femtocells) using CPC-Q and PDPC-Q with R1 in both IL and CL paradigms. It can be observed that CL is much better than IL, where from the figure it can be shown that the aggregate capacity gain of CPC-Q over PDPC-Q in case of CL is marginal. Since CPC-Q is considered the single agent version of DPC-Q, it should converge to the global optimal values. This is shown in the figure at small number of femtocells (Nf = 1 and 2). The optimal values are calculated using exhaustive search over all possible actions, where the optimal value is defined to be the maximum aggregate capacity the system can achieve while maintaining the capacity of the macrocell in the convergence range (±1 bits/sec/Hz from βo). However, starting from Nf = 3, CPC-Q begins to be infeasible since the size of the possible actions set A becomes very large (at Nf = 5: |A| = 320, 000, 0). So, besides the computational problems, the condition of visiting all state-action pair becomes infeasible. Thus, getting the optimal value is also not feasible (that’s why we stopped CPC-Q at Nf = 4). Note also that we stopped the exhaustive search at Nf = 5 due to complexity and memory problems, while PDPC-Q is shown at Nf = 6 and 7 just to illustrate the continuity of our algorithm.\nFigures 2 and 3 show the robustness of the proposed DPCQ algorithm. In these figures, we started with Nf = 5, then we added a new femtocell after every 4000 iterations3to reach\nNf = 29 at the 96000th iteration. Finally, we add another femtocell at the 99000th iteration. The figures show how DPCQ using the CL paradigm is more robust to the deployment of new femtocells compared to the IL paradigm. Moreover, in these figures we compare the performance of DPC-Q to the docitive idea presented in [7]. We investigated two cases: 1) the already deployed femtocells share their Q-tables with the new femtocells when they first join the system (suffixed with share on the figure), 2) the new deployed femtocells starts with a zero initialized Q-tables (suffixed with scratch on the figure). Figure 2 shows the macrocell convergence on a certain subcarrier using DPC-Q with R1 in both IL and CL paradigms, where it can be observed that the CL paradigm maintains the macrocell capacity within the range of convergence (6 ± 1 bits/sec/Hz) and reacts well to the effect of the new deployed femtocells, without the need to have a learning phase again every time a new femtocell is deployed, which is a very interesting observation. It can also be observed that our proposed CL paradigm converges to the same value regardless the already deployed femtocells shared its Q-tables with the new ones or not. So, sharing could be ignored, thus decreasing the overall overhead. On the other hand, the IL paradigm showed a very bad reaction to the network dynamics, where 1) convergence is not attained (i.e. an oscillating behavior is generated), 2) as Nf increases, IL paradigm may push the macrocell capacity out of the convergence range when the network becomes more dense. Thus, CL is more scalable than IL. However, it can be noticed that the docitive idea is useful in the IL paradigm, where sharing the Q-tables of the already deployed femtocells with the new ones is much better (in terms of the value that the macrocell capacity oscillates around) than beginning with zero-initialized (scratch) Q-tables. In terms of speed of convergence, it can be noticed that, although the learning process may need large number of iterations initially, CL decreases the dynamics of the learning process, and hence, making it faster. This can be noticed from the figure, where\nCL converged almost at the 300th iteration, which is much earlier than the IL paradigm. Also, after the deployment of each new femtocell, CL took less than 10 iterations only - around 0.01 seconds - to re-achieve convergence.\nFigure 3 shows the aggregate femtocells capacity over the learning iterations. It can be noticed that using the CL paradigm, the aggregate capacity increases as more femtocells are deployed in the network, while in the IL paradigms, since convergence is already not maintained, the aggregate capacity behavior has a sporadic behavior, which indicates clearly that IL is not efficient to react to the network dynamics. However, in the CL paradigm from the 64000th to the 72000th iteration(640th to 720th according to figure’s scale), it can be noticed that the aggregate capacity decreases. The reason is that as more femtocells are being deployed, the network becomes very dense and since using the CL paradigm makes the cooperating femtocells use the same powers, this may force the macrocell capacity to violate the range of convergence. Thus, all the femtocells will have to decrease the power used to maintain again the macrocell capacity within the range of convergence leading to the decrease of their aggregate capacity. Note that at the 64000th and 72000th iterations, ǫ is already removed, which proves that R1 learns well even when ǫ is removed.\nFinally, in order to compare the aggregate capacity the CL paradigm achieves, after the incremental deployment of femtocells, to the ideal value, we used the small scale problem again. This is shown in figure 1(b), where we started with Nf = 2 and added an extra femtocell at the 8000th, 12000th and 13500th iterations4. Again, it can be observed that CL achieves aggregate capacity that is very close to the optimal one while the IL paradigm is far from it.\n3In figures 2 and 3, ǫ is removed at the 50000th iteration and the figures were drawn with step = 100 in order to achieve better resolution.\n4In figure 1(b), ǫ is removed at the 12000th iteration and the figure was drawn with step = 10 in order to achieve better resolution."

    "abstractText" : "In this paper, we address the problem of distributed interference management of cognitive femtocells that share the same frequency range with macrocells (primary user) using distributed multi-agent Q-learning. We formulate and solve three problems representing three different Q-learning algorithms: namely, centralized, distributed and partially distributed power control using Q-learning (CPC-Q, DPC-Q and PDPC-Q). CPCQ, although not of practical interest, characterizes the global optimum. Each of DPC-Q and PDPC-Q works in two different learning paradigms: Independent (IL) and Cooperative (CL). The former is considered the simplest form for applying Qlearning in multi-agent scenarios, where all the femtocells learn independently. The latter is the proposed scheme in which femtocells share partial information during the learning process in order to strike a balance between practical relevance and performance. In terms of performance, the simulation results showed that the CL paradigm outperforms the IL paradigm and achieves an aggregate femtocells capacity that is very close to the optimal one. For the practical relevance issue, we evaluate the robustness and scalability of DPC-Q, in real time, by deploying new femtocells in the system during the learning process, where we showed that DPC-Q in the CL paradigm is scalable to large number of femtocells and more robust to the network dynamics compared to the IL paradigm.",
