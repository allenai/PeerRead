      "text" : "Large efforts are spent in our community on developing new state-of-the-art approaches. To document that those approaches are better, they are applied to unseen data and the obtained performance score is compared to previous approaches. In order to make results comparable, a provided split\nThis paper is published in the proceedings of EMNLP 2017.\n1https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06799 2https://github.com/UKPLab/\nemnlp2017-bilstm-cnn-crf\nbetween train, development and test data is often used, for example from a former shared task.\nIn recent years, deep neural networks were shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance for a wide range of NLP tasks, including many sequence tagging tasks (Ma and Hovy, 2016), dependency parsing (Andor et al., 2016), and machine translation (Wu et al., 2016). The training process for neural networks is highly non-deterministic as it usually depends on a random weight initialization, a random shuffling of the training data for each epoch, and repeatedly applying random dropout masks. The error function of a neural network is a highly non-convex function of the parameters with the potential for many distinct local minima (LeCun et al., 1998; Erhan et al., 2010). Depending on the seed value for the pseudo-random number generator, the network will converge to a different local minimum.\nOur experiments show that these different local minima have vastly different characteristics on unseen data. For the recent NER system by Ma and Hovy (2016) we observed that, depending on the random seed value, the performance on unseen data varies between 89.99% and 91.00% F1-score. The difference between the best and worst performance is statistically significant (p < 10−4) using a randomization test3. In conclusion, whether this newly developed approach is perceived as state-of-the-art or as mediocre, largely depends on which random seed value is selected. This issue is not limited to this specific approach, but potentially applies to all approaches with non-deterministic training processes.\nThis large dependence on the random seed value creates several challenges when evaluating new\n31 Million iterations. p-value adapted using the Bonferroni correction to take the 86 tested seed values into account.\nar X\niv :1\n70 7.\n09 86\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 3\n1 Ju\nl 2 01\n7\napproaches:\n• Observing a (statistically significant) improvement through a new non-deterministic approach might not be the result of a superior approach, but the result of having a more favorable sequence of random numbers.\n• Promising approaches might be rejected too early, as they fail to deliver an outperformance simply due to a less favorable sequence of random numbers.\n• Reproducing results is difficult.\nTo study the impact of the random seed value on the performance we will focus on five linguistic sequence tagging tasks: POS-tagging, Chunking, Named Entity Recognition, Entity Recognition4, and Event Detection. Further we will focus on Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) Networks (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997b), as those demonstrated state-of-the-art performance for a wide variety of sequence tagging tasks (Ma and Hovy, 2016; Lample et al., 2016; Søgaard and Goldberg, 2016).\nFixing the random seed value would solve the issue with the reproducibility, however, there is no justification for choosing one seed value over another seed value. Hence, instead of reporting and comparing a single performance, we show that comparing score distributions can lead to new insights into the functioning of algorithms.\nOur main contributions are:\n1. Showing the implications of non-deterministic approaches on the evaluation of approaches and the requirement to compare score distributions instead of single performance scores.\n2. Comparison of two recent, state-of-the-art systems for NER and showing that reporting a single performance score can be misleading.\n3.

      "text" : "Validating and reproducing results is an important activity in science to manifest the correctness of previous conclusions and to gain new insights into the presented approaches. Fokkens et al. (2013) show that reproducing results is not always straightforward, as factors like preprocessing (e.g. tokenization), experimental setup (e.g. splitting data), the version of components, the exact implementation of features, and the treatment of ties can have a major impact on the achieved performance and sometimes on the drawn conclusions.\nFor approaches with non-deterministic training procedures, like neural networks, reproducing exact results becomes even more difficult, as randomness can play a major role in the outcome of experiments. The error function of a neural network is a highly non-convex function of the parameters with the potential for many distinct local minima (LeCun et al., 1998; Erhan et al., 2010). The sequence of random numbers plays a major role to which minima the network converges during the training process. However, not all minima generalize equally well to unseen data. Erhan et al. (2010) showed for the MNIST handwritten digit recognition task that different random seeds result in largely varying performances. They noted further that with increasing depth of the neural network, the probability of finding poor local minima increases.\nAs (informally) defined by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997a), a minimum can be flat, where the error function remains approximately constant for a large connected region in weight-space, or it can be sharp, where the error function increases rapidly in\na small neighborhood of the minimum. A conceptual sketch is given in Figure 1. The error functions for training and testing are typically not perfectly synced, i.e. the local minima on the train or development set are not the local minima for the held-out test set. A sharp minimum usually depicts poorer generalization capabilities, as a slight variation results in a rapid increase of the error function. On the other hand, flat minima generalize better on new data (Keskar et al., 2016). Keskar et al. observe for the MNIST, TIMIT, and CIFAR dataset, that the generalization gap is not due to over-fitting or over-training, but due to different generalization capabilities of the local minima the networks converge to.\nA priori it is unknown to which type of local minimum a neural network will converge. Some methods like the weight initialization (Erhan et al., 2010; Glorot and Bengio, 2010) or small-batch training (Keskar et al., 2016) help to avoid bad (e.g. sharp) minima. Nonetheless, the non-deterministic behavior of approaches must be considered when they are evaluated."

      "text" : "Two recent, state-of-the-art systems for NER are proposed by Ma and Hovy (2016)5 and by Lample et al. (2016)6. Lample et al. report an F1-score of 90.94% and Ma and Hovy report an F1-score of 91.21%. Ma and Hovy draw the conclusion that their system achieves a significant improvement over the system by Lample et al.\nWe re-ran both implementations multiple times, each time only changing the seed value of the random number generator. We ran the Ma and Hovy system 86 times and the Lample et al. system, due to its high computational requirement, for 41 times. The score distribution is depicted as a violin plot in Figure 2. Using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov significance test (Massey, 1951), we observe a statistically significant difference between these two distributions (p < 0.01). The plot reveals that the quartiles for the Lample et al. system are above those of the Ma and Hovy system. Further it reveals a smaller standard deviation σ of the F1-\n5https://github.com/XuezheMax/ LasagneNLP\n6https://github.com/glample/tagger\nscores for the Lample et al. system. Using a BrownForsythe test, the standard deviations are different with p < 0.05. Table 1 shows the minimum, the maximum, and the median performance for the test performances.\nBased on this observation, we draw the conclusion that the system by Lample et al. outperforms the system by Ma and Hovy, as their implementation achieves a higher score distribution and shows a lower standard deviation.\nIn a usual setup, approaches would be compared on a development set and the run with the highest development score would be used for unseen data, i.e. be used to report the test performance. For the Lample et al. system we observe a Spearman’s rank correlation between the development and the test score of ρ = 0.229. This indicates a weak correlation and that the performance on the development set is not a reliable indicator. Using the run with the best development score (94.44%) would yield a test performance of mere 90.31%. Using the second best run on development set (94.28%), would yield state-of-the-art performance with 91.00%. This difference is statistically significant (p < 0.002). In conclusion, a development set will not necessarily solve the issue with bad local minima.\nThe main difference between these two approaches is in the generation of character-based representations: Ma and Hovy uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (LeCun et al., 1989), while Lample et al. uses an LSTM-network. As our experiments in section 6.4 show, both approaches perform comparably if all other parameters were kept the same. Further, we could only observe a\nstatistically significant improvement for the tasks POS, Chunking and Event Detection. For NER and Entity Recognition, the difference was statistically not significant given the number of tested hyperparameters.\nIn the next step, we evaluated the impact of the random seed value for the five sequence tagging tasks described in section 4. We sampled randomly 1830 different configurations, for example different numbers of recurrent units, and ran the network twice, each time with a different seed value. The results are depicted in Table 2.\nThe largest difference was observed for the ACE 2005 Entities dataset: Using one seed value, the network achieved an F1 performance of 82.5% while using another seed value, the network achieved a performance of only 74.3%. Even though this is a rare extreme case, the median difference between different weight initializations is still large. For example for the CoNLL 2003 NER dataset, the median difference is at 0.38% and the 95th percentile is at 1.08%.\nIn conclusion, if the fact of different local minima is not taken care of and single performance scores are compared, there is a high chance of drawing false conclusions and either rejecting promising approaches or selecting weaker approaches due to a more or less favorable sequence of random numbers."

      "text" : "In order to find LSTM-network architectures that perform robustly on different tasks, we selected five classical NLP tasks as benchmark tasks: Partof-Speech tagging (POS), Chunking, Named Entity Recognition (NER), Entity Recognition (Entities) and Event Detection (Events).\nFor Part-of-Speech tagging, we use the benchmark setup described by Toutanova et al. (2003). Using the full training set for POS tagging would hinder our ability to detect design choices that are consistently better than others. The error rate for this dataset is approximately 3% (Marcus et al., 1993), making all improvements above 97% accuracy likely the result of chance. A 97.24% accuracy was achieved by Toutanova et al. (2003). Hence, we reduced the training set size from over 38.000 sentences to the first 500 sentences. This decreased the accuracy to about 95%.\nFor Chunking, we use the CoNLL 2000 shared task setup. For Named Entity Recognition (NER), we use the CoNLL 2003 setup. The ACE 2005 entity recognition task annotated not only named entities, but all words referring to an entity, e.g. the phrase U.S. president. We use the same data split as Li et al. (2013). For the Event Detection task, we use the TempEval3 Task B setup. There, the smallest extent of text, usually a single word, that expresses the occurrence of an event, is annotated.\nFor the POS-task, we report accuracy and for the other tasks we report the F1-score."

We evaluate the BIO and IOBES schemes for tagging segments.\nDropout. We compare no dropout, naive dropout, and variational dropout (Gal and Ghahramani, 2016). Naive dropout applies a new dropout mask at every time step of the LSTM-layers. Variational dropout applies the same dropout mask for all time steps in the same sentence. Further, it applies dropout to the recurrent units. We evaluate the dropout rates {0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5}.\nClassifier.

      "text" : "We have shown in section 3 that re-running nondeterministic approaches multiple times and comparing score distributions is essential to draw correct conclusions. However, to truly understand the capabilities of an approach, it is interesting to test the approach with different sets of hyperparameters for the complete network.\nTraining and tuning a neural network can be time consuming, sometimes taking multiple days to train a single instance of a network. A priori it is hard to know which hyperparameters will yield the best performance and the selection of the parameters often makes the difference between mediocre and state-of-the-art performance (Hutter et al., 2014). If an approach yields good performance only for a narrow set of parameters, it might be difficult to adapt the approach to new tasks, new domains\nor new languages, as a large range of possible parameters must be evaluated, each time requiring a significant amount of training time. Hence it is desirable, that the approach yields stable results for a wide range of parameters.\nIn order to find approaches that result in high performance and are robust against the remaining parameters, we decided to randomly sample several hundred network configurations from the set described in section 4.2. For each sampled configuration, we compare different options, e.g. different options for the last layer of the network. For example, we sampled in total 975 configurations and each configuration was trained with a Softmax classifier as well as with a CRF classifier, totaling to 1950 trained networks.\nOur results are presented in Table 3. The table shows that for the NER task 232 configurations were sampled randomly and for 210 of the 232 configurations (90.5%), the CRF setup achieved a better test performance than the setup with a Softmax classifier. To measure the difference between these two options, we compute the median of the absolute differences: Let Si be the test performance (F1-measure) for the Softmax setup for configuration i and Ci the test performance for the CRF setup. We then compute ∆F1 = median(S1 − C1, S2 −C2, . . . , S232 −C232). For the NER task, the median difference was ∆F1 = −0.66%, i.e. the setup with a Softmax classifier achieved on average an F1-score of 0.66 percentage points below that of the CRF setup.\nWe also evaluated the standard deviation of the F1-\nscores to detect approaches that are less dependent on the remaining hyperparameters and the random number generator. The standard deviation σ for the CRF-classifier is with 0.0060 significantly lower (p < 10−3 using Brown-Forsythe test) than for the Softmax classifier with σ = 0.0082."

For the NER task it further achieves a 27% lower standard deviation (statistically significant with p < 10−3), indicating that it is less sensitive to the remaining configuration of the network.\nThe CRF classifier only fails for the Event Detection task. This task has nearly no dependency between tags, as often only a single token is annotated as an event trigger in a sentence.\nWe studied the differences between these two classifiers in terms of number of LSTM-layers. As Figure 3 shows, a Softmax classifier profits from a deep LSTM-network with multiple stacked layers. On the other hand, if a CRF classifier is used, the effect of additional LSTM-layers is much smaller."

Not only were the medians for these three optimizers higher, but also the standard deviation was with 0.0096, 0.0091, and 0.0092 roughly 35% smaller in comparison to Adagrad. A large standard deviation indicates that the optimizer is sensitive to the hyperparameters as well as to the random initialization and bears the risk that the optimizer produces subpar results.\nThe best result was achieved by Nadam. For 453 out of 882 configurations (51.4%), it yielded the highest performance out of the six tested optimizers. For the NER task, it produced on average a 0.82 percentage points better performance than Adagrad.\nBesides test performance, the convergence speed is important in order to reduce training time.

This is quite surprising, as both approaches have fundamentally different properties: The CNN approach from Ma and Hovy (2016) takes only trigrams into account. It is also position independent, i.e. the network will not be able to distinguish between trigrams at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of a word, which can be crucial information for some tasks. The BiLSTM approach from Lample et al. (2016) takes all characters of the word into account.

Based on the published performance scores, Ma and Hovy draw the conclusion of a significant improvement over the approach of Lample et al. Re-executing the provided implementations with different seed values however showed that the implementation of Lample et al. results in a superior score distribution generalizing better to unseen data.\nComparing score distributions reduces the risk of rejecting promising approaches or falsely accepting weaker approaches. Further it can lead to new insights on the properties of an approach. We demonstrated this for ten design choices and hyperparameters of LSTM-networks for five tasks.\nBy studying the standard deviation of scores, we estimated the dependence on hyperparameters and on the random seed value for different approaches. We showed that SGD, Adagrad and Adadelta have a higher dependence than RMSProp, Adam or Nadam. We have shown that variational dropout also reduces the dependence on the hyperparameters and on the random seed value. As future work, we will investigate if those methods are either less dependent on the hyperparameters or are less dependent on the random seed value, e.g. if they avoid converging to bad local minima.\nBy testing a large number of configurations, we showed that some choices consistently lead to superior performance and are less dependent on the remaining configuration of the network. Thus, there is a good chance that these configurations require less tuning when applied to new tasks or domains."

We demonstrate for common sequence tagging tasks that the seed value for the random number generator can result in statistically significant (p < 10−4) differences for state-of-the-art systems. For two recent systems for NER, we observe an absolute difference of one percentage point F1-score depending on the selected seed value, making these systems perceived either as state-of-the-art or mediocre. Instead of publishing and reporting single performance scores, we propose to compare score distributions based on multiple executions. Based on the evaluation of 50.000 LSTMnetworks for five sequence tagging tasks, we present network architectures that produce both superior performance as well as are more stable with respect to the remaining hyperparameters. The full experimental results are published in (Reimers and Gurevych, 2017).1 The implementation of our network is publicly available.2",
