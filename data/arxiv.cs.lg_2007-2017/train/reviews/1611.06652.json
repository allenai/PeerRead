The most commonly used and studied variant maintains a diagonal matrix approximation to second order information by accumulating past gradients which are used to tune the step size adaptively. In certain situations the full-matrix variant of AdaGrad is expected to attain better performance, however in high dimensions it is computationally impractical. We present Ada-LR and RadaGrad two computationally efficient approximations to full-matrix AdaGrad based on randomized dimensionality reduction. They are able to capture dependencies between features and achieve similar performance to full-matrix AdaGrad but at a much smaller computational cost. We show that the regret of Ada-LR is close to the regret of full-matrix AdaGrad which can have an up-to exponentially smaller dependence on the dimension than the diagonal variant. Empirically, we show that Ada-LR and RadaGrad perform similarly to full-matrix AdaGrad. On the task of training convolutional neural networks as well as recurrent neural networks, RadaGrad achieves faster convergence than diagonal AdaGrad.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Nov 2016 05:15:50 GMT  (437kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06652v1", "To appear in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 29 (NIPS 2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 29 (NIPS 2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["gabriel krummenacher", "brian mcwilliams", "yannic kilcher", "joachim m buhmann", "nicolai meinshausen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.06652"}
