      "text" : "E-commerce recommender systems aim to present items with high utility to the consumers [20]. Utility may be decomposed into form utility: the item is desired as it is manifested, and time utility: the item is desired at the given point in time [30]; recommender systems should take both types of utility into account. Economists define items to be either durable goods or nondurable goods based on how long they are intended to last before being replaced [29]. A key characteristic of durable goods is the long duration of time between successive purchases within item categories whereas this duration for nondurable goods is much shorter, or even negligible. Thus, durable and nondurable goods have differing time utility characteristics which lead to differing demand characteristics.\nAlthough we have witnessed great success of collaborative filtering in media recommendation, we should be careful when expanding its application to general e-commerce recommendation involving both durable and nondurable goods due to the following reasons:\n1. Since media such as movies and music are nondurable goods, most users are quite receptive to buying or renting them in rapid succession. However, users only purchase durable goods when the time is right. For instance, most users will not buy televisions the day after they have already bought one. Therefore, recommending an item for which a user has no immediate demand can hurt user experience and waste an opportunity to drive sales.\nar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n06 34\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n1 Fe\nb 20\n2. A key assumption made by matrix factorization- and approximation-based collaborative filtering algorithms is that the underlying rating matrix is of low-rank since only a few factors typically contribute to an individual’s form utility [5, 34]. However, a user’s demand is not only driven by form utility, but is the combined effect of both form utility and time utility. Hence, even if the underlying form utility matrix is of low-rank, the overall purchase intention matrix is usually of high-rank, and thus cannot be directly recovered by existing approaches. To see this, we construct a toy example with 50 users and 100 durable goods. Following the low-rank assumption, we assume the form utility matrix Z ∈ R50×100 is generated by UV>, where U ∈ R50×10 and V ∈ R100×10 are both Gaussian random matrices with mean 1 and standard deviation 0.5. As discussed above, user i’s purchase intention of item j is mediated by a time utility factor hij . We assume this factor is sampled from a rectified Gaussian distribution with mean 1 and standard deviation 0.5.1 Then the purchase intention matrix B ∈ R50×100 is given by B = Z−H, where H ∈ R50×100 is the time utility factor matrix. Figure 1 shows the distributions of singular values for matrices Z and B. We observe that although the form utility matrix Z is of low-rank, the purchase intention matrix B is a full-rank matrix since all its singular values are greater than 0. This simple example illustrates that considering users’ demands can make the underlying matrix no longer of low-rank, thus violating the key assumption made by many collaborative filtering algorithms.\nAn additional challenge faced by many real-world recommender systems is the one-sided sampling of implicit feedback [17, 25]. Unlike the Netflix-like setting that provides both positive and negative feedback (high and low ratings), in many e-commerce systems no negative feedback is available. For example, a user might not purchase an item because she does not derive utility from it, or just because she was simply unaware of it or plans to buy it in the future. In this sense, the labeled training data only draws from the positive class, and the unlabeled data is a mixture of positive and negative samples, a problem usually referred to as positive-unlabeled (PU) learning [11, 22, 15].\n1We use a rectified Gaussian distribution to ensure non-negative time utility factors. As introduced in Section 3, hij is a function of item j’s inter-purchase duration d and the time gap t of user i’s most recent purchase within the item j’s category. If d and t are Gaussian random variables, then hij = max(0, d− t) follows a rectified Gaussian distribution.\nTo address these limitations, we study the problem of demand-aware recommendation. Given purchase triplets (user, item, time) and item categories, the objective is to make recommendations based on users’ overall predicted combination of form utility and time utility.\nWe denote purchases by the sparse binary tensor P . To model implicit feedback, we assume that P is obtained by thresholding an underlying real-valued utility tensor to a binary tensor Y and then revealing a subset of Y’s positive entries. The key to demand-aware recommendation is defining an appropriate utility measure for all (user, item, time) triplets. To this end, we quantify purchase intention as a combined effect of form utility and time utility. Specifically, we model a user’s time utility for an item by comparing the time t since her most recent purchase within the item’s category and the item category’s underlying inter-purchase duration d; the smaller the value of t− d, the less likely she needs this item. In contrast, t ≥ d may indicate that the item needs to be replaced, and she may be open to related recommendations. Therefore, the hinge loss h = max(0, d− t) can be employed to measure the time utility factor for a (user, item) pair. Then the purchase intention for a (user, item, time) triplet is given by x − h, where x denotes the user’s form utility. This observation allows us to cast demand-aware recommendation as the problem of learning users’ form utility tensor X and items’ inter-purchase durations vector d given the binary tensor P .\nAlthough the learning problem can be naturally formulated as a tensor nuclear norm minimization problem, the high computational cost significantly limits its application to large-scale recommendation problems. To address this limitation, we first relax the problem to a matrix optimization problem with a class-dependent loss. We note that the problem after relaxation is still non-trivial to solve since it is a highly non-smooth problem with nested hinge losses. More severely, the optimization problem involves mnl entries, where m, n, and l are the number of users, items, and time slots, respectively. Thus a naive optimization algorithm will take at least O(mnl) time, and is intractable for large-scale recommendation problems. To overcome this limitation, we develop an efficient alternating minimization algorithm and show that its time complexity is only approximately proportional to the number of nonzero elements in the purchase records tensor P . Since P is usually very sparse, our algorithm is extremely efficient and can scale up to problems with millions of user and items. For instance, our synthetic study shows that the proposed algorithm is able to make demand-aware recommendations for a trillion (user, item) pairs in less than 2 hours.\nCompared to existing recommender systems, our work has the following contributions and advantages: (i) to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that makes demand-aware recommendation by considering inter-purchase durations for durable and nondurable goods; (ii) the proposed algorithm is able to simultaneously infer items’ inter-purchase durations and users’ real-time purchase intentions, which can help e-retailers make more informed decisions on inventory planning and marketing strategy; (iii) by effectively exploiting sparsity, the proposed algorithm is extremely efficient and able to handle problems with a huge number of users and items."

      "text" : "Our contributions herein relate to three different areas of prior work: consumer modeling from a microeconomics and marketing perspective [6], time-aware recommender systems [4, 31, 9, 21], and PU learning [22, 10, 15, 16, 25, 2]. The extensive consumer modeling literature is concerned with descriptive and analytical models of choice rather than prediction or recommendation, but nonetheless forms the basis for our modeling approach. A variety of time-aware recommender systems have been proposed to exploit time information, but none of them explicitly consider the notion of time utility derived from inter-purchase durations in item categories. Much of the PU learning literature is focused on the binary classification problem, e.g. [22, 10], whereas we are in the collaborative filtering setting. For the papers that do examine collabo-\nrative filtering with PU learning or learning with implicit feedback [16, 25, 2], they mainly focus on media recommendation and overlook users’ demands, thus are not suitable for durable goods recommendation.\nTemporal aspects of the recommendation problem have been examined in a few ways: as part of the cold-start problem [3], to capture dynamics in interests or ratings over time [19, 8, 31], and as part of the context in context-aware recommenders [1]. However, the problem we address in this paper is different from all of those aspects, and in fact could be combined with the other aspects in future solutions. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing work that tries to take inter-purchase durations into account to better time recommendations as we do herein."

Scalars such as entries of tensors, matrices, and vectors are denoted by lowercase letters, e.g., a. In particular, the (i, j, k) entry of a third-order tensor A is denoted by aijk.\nGiven a set of m users, n items, and l time slots, we construct a third-order binary tensor P ∈ {0, 1}m×n×l to represent the purchase history. Specifically, entry pijk = 1 indicates that user i has purchased item j in time slot k. We denote ‖P‖0 as the number of nonzero entries in tensor P . Since P is usually very sparse, we have ‖P‖0 mnl. Also, we assume that the n items belong to r item categories, with items in each category sharing similar inter-purchase durations.2 We use an n-dimensional vector c ∈ {1, 2, . . . , r}n to represent the category membership of each item. Given P and c, we further generate a tensor T ∈ Rm×r×l where ticjk denotes the number of time slots between user i’s most recent purchase within item category cj until time k. If user i has not purchased within item category cj until time k, ticjk is set to +∞."

      "text" : "In this work, we formulate users’ utility as a combined effect of form utility and time utility. To this end, we use an underlying third-order tensor X ∈ Rm×n×l to quantify form utility. In addition, we employ a nonnegative vector d ∈ Rr+ to measure the underlying inter-purchase duration times of the r item categories. It is understood that the inter-purchase durations for durable good categories are large, while for nondurable good categories are small, or even zero. In this study, we focus on items’ inherent properties and assume that the inter-purchase durations are user-independent. The problem of learning personalized durations will be studied in our future work.\nAs discussed above, the demand is mediated by the time elapsed since the last purchase of an item in the same category. Let dcj be the inter-purchase duration time of item j’s category cj , and let ticjk be the time gap of user i’s most recent purchase within item category cj until time k. Then if dcj > ticjk, a previously purchased item in category cj continues to be useful, and thus user i’s utility from item j is weak. Intuitively, the greater the dcj − ticjk, the weaker the utility. On the other hand, dcj < ticjk indicates the item is nearing the end of its lifetime and the user may be open to recommendations in category cj . We use a hinge loss h(i, cj , k) = max(0, dcj−ticjk) to model such time utility. The overall utility can be obtained by comparing form utility and time utility. In more detail, we model a binary utility indicator tensor Y ∈ {0, 1}m×n×l as\n2To meet this requirement, the granularity of categories should be properly selected. For instance, the category ‘Smart TV’ is a better choice than the category ‘Electrical Equipment’, since the latter category covers a broad range of goods with different durations.\nbeing generated by the following thresholding process:\nyijk = 1[xijk − h(i, cj , k) > τ ], (1)\nwhere 1(·) : R→ {0, 1} is the indicator function, and τ > 0 is a predefined threshold. Note that the positive entries of Y denote high purchase intentions, while the positive entries of P denote actual purchases. Generally speaking, a purchase only happens when the utility is high, but a high utility does not necessarily lead to a purchase. This observation allows us to link the binary tensors P and Y : P is generated by a one-sided sampling process that only reveals a subset of Y’s positive entries. Following the setting of PU learning [11, 22, 15], we assume that the positive entries of P are uniformly sampled from positive entries of Y .\nIt is impossible to directly recover tensor X from P ,3 but fortunately, we need not recover X to make recommendations. Instead, we only need to infer the binary tensor Y whose entries yijk can be obtained by comparing xijk − h(i, cj , k) to τ . In this sense, our goal becomes learning a tensor Z ∈ Rm×n×l such that the binary tensors obtained by thresholding Z and X to be the same. We note that tensor Z should be of low-rank to capture temporal dynamics of users’ interests, which are generally believed to be dictated by a small number of latent factors [24].\nIn addition, since P is generated by Y via a one-sided sampling process, we follow [15] and include an asymmetric margin loss with a parameter η trading the relative cost of positive and unlabeled samples [28]:\nL(Z,P)= η ∑\nijk: pijk=1\nmax[1− (zijk −max(0, dcj − ticjk)), 0] 2 + (1− η) ∑ ijk: pijk=0 l(zijk, 0),\nwhere l(x, c) = (x− c)2 denotes the squared loss. By combining asymmetric sampling and the low-rank property together, we recover the tensor Z and the inter-purchase duration vector d by solving the following tensor nuclear norm minimization (TNNM) problem:\nmin Z∈Rm×n×l, d∈Rr+\nη ∑\nijk: pijk=1\nmax[1− (zijk −max(0, dcj − ticjk)), 0] 2\n+ (1− η) ∑\nijk: pijk=0\nz2ijk + λ ‖Z‖∗, (2)\nwhere ‖Z‖∗ denotes the tensor nuclear norm, a convex combination of nuclear norms of Z’s unfolded matrices [23]. Given the learned Ẑ and d̂, the underlying binary tensor Y can be recovered by\nyijk = 1[ẑijk −max(0, d̂cj − ticjk) > τ ].\nWe note that although the TNNM problem (2) can be solved by optimization techniques such as block coordinate descent [23] or ADMM [12], they suffer from high computational cost since they need to be solved iteratively with multiple SVDs at each iteration. An alternative way to solve the problem is tensor factorization [18]. However, this also involves iterative singular vector estimation, and is thus not scalable enough. As a typical example, recovering a rank 10 tensor of size 500× 500× 500 takes the state-of-the-art tensor factorization algorithm TenALS 4 more than 20, 000 seconds on an Intel Xeon 2.40 GHz processor with 32 GB main memory.\n3To see this, consider a tensor X with all entries equaling ρ, which leads to an all one tensor Y if ρ > τ + φ, where φ is the upper bound of h(i, cj , k) As is apparent, ρ cannot be uniquely identified by just observing Y .\n4http://web.engr.illinois.edu/˜swoh/software/optspace/code.html"

      "text" : "In this subsection, we discuss how to significantly improve the scalability of the proposed demand-aware recommendation model. To this end, we assume that an individual’s form utility does not change over time, an assumption widely-used in many collaborative filtering methods [27]. Under this assumption, the tensor Z is a repeated copy of its frontal slice Z::1, i.e.,\nZ = Z::1 ◦ e, (3)\nwhere e is an l-dimensional all-one vector and the symbol ◦ represents the outer product operation. In this way, we can relax the problem of learning a third-order tensor Z to the problem of learning its frontal slice, which is a second-order tensor (matrix). For notational simplicity, we use a matrix Z to denote the frontal slice Z::1, and use zij to denote the entry (i, j) of the matrix Z.\nSince Z is a low-rank tensor, its frontal slice Z should be of low-rank as well. With the assumption, the minimization problem (2) simplifies to:\nmin Z∈Rm×n\nd∈Rr\nη ∑\nijk: pijk=1\nmax[1− (zij −max(0, dcj − ticjk)), 0] 2\n+ (1− η) ∑\nijk: pijk=0\nz2ij + λ ‖Z‖∗ := f(Z,d), (4)\nwhere ‖Z‖∗ stands for the matrix nuclear norm, the convex surrogate of the matrix rank function.

In Section 4, we discuss how to efficiently optimize the problem (4) to make demand-aware recommendations for a huge number of users and items."

If no purchase is predicted within the item category, we set the error be the total number of time slots l. Ideally, good recommendations should have both small item rankings and small time errors. Thus we adopt the top percentages, i.e., ranking / n× 100% and error / l × 100%, as the evaluation metrics of item and purchase time prediction tasks, respectively. The algorithms M3F, PMF, and WR-MF are excluded from the purchase time prediction task since they are static models.\nFigure 3 displays the predictive performance of the seven recommendation algorithms. Compared to all the baseline algorithms, DAROSS, the proposed demand-aware recommendation algorithm yields the best performance for both datasets and tasks. As expected, we also observe that DAROSS achieves better performance on Tmall than Amazon Review. We conjecture that this is because the time stamps of Amazon Review reflect the review time instead of purchase time, and inter-reviewing durations could be different from inter-purchase durations. Table 2 reports the inter-reviewing durations of Amazon Review estimated by our algorithm DAROSS. Although they may not reflect the true inter-purchase durations, the estimated durations still make sense since they clearly distinguished between durable good categories, e.g., automotive, musical instruments, and non-durable good categories, e.g., instant video, apps, and food. Apparently, these categories are relatively coarse and may contain multiple sub-categories with different durations. By choosing a more proper category granularity (which is unfortunately not supported by Amazon Review), we expect to achieve more accurate duration estimations and also better recommendation performance. We do not report the estimated durations of Tmall herein since its item categories are anonymized.\nWe finally test our algorithm on the full set of Amazon Review8 to evaluate its performance on large-scale real-world data. After removing duplicate items, the data set contains more than 72 million product reviews from 19.8 million users and 7.7 million items that belong to 24 item categories. The collected reviews span a long range of time, i.e., from May 1996 to July 2014, which leads to 6, 639 time slots in total. Comparing to the small subset we evaluated earlier, the full set is a much more challenging data set both due to its much larger size and much lower sampling rate, i.e., many reviewers only provided a few reviews, and many items were only reviewed a few times. Indeed, most of our baseline algorithms fail to handle such a large data set and we only obtain the predictive performance of three algorithms DAROSS, WR-MF, and PMF. Their average item ranking percentages are 17.4%, 21.9%, and 38.6%, respectively. In addition, it only takes our algorithm 10 iterations and 37 minutes to find out the optimal solution. All these results clearly validate the scalability and effectiveness of our proposed algorithm."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion",
      "text" : "In this paper, we examine the problem of demand-aware recommendation in settings when inter-purchase duration within item categories affects users’ purchase intention in combination with intrinsic properties\n8http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/\nof the items themselves. Also accounting for the one-sided sampling from implicit feedback present in ecommerce, we formulate a TNNM problem that seeks to learn the form utility tensor and estimate a vector of inter-purchase durations jointly.\nThe TNNM formulation does not scale to large realistic problem sizes, and thus we develop a tractable matrix optimization relaxation that we solve via an alternating minimization scheme. We show that such an approach converges to a stationary point and, despite challenging subproblems, has tractable time complexity dominated by the number of purchases in the data rather than the cardinalities of users, items, and time slots.\nOur empirical studies show that the proposed approach can yield perfect recovery of duration vectors in noiseless settings; it is robust to noise and scalable as analyzed theoretically. On two real-world datasets, Tmall and Amazon Review, we show that our algorithm outperforms five state-of-the-art recommender systems on both metrics of our interest: item prediction and purchase time prediction. Thus overall, the algorithm proposed in this paper ought to be considered for practical deployment in e-commerce recommendation of durable goods both due to its accuracy and its scalability."

The demand for items is a combined effect of form utility and time utility, i.e., a product must both be intrinsically appealing to a consumer and the time must be right for purchase. In particular for durable goods, time utility is a function of inter-purchase duration within product category because consumers are unlikely to purchase two items in the same category in close temporal succession. Moreover, purchase data, in contrast to ratings data, is implicit with non-purchases not necessarily indicating dislike. Together, these issues give rise to the positive-unlabeled demand-aware recommendation problem that we pose via joint lowrank tensor completion and product category inter-purchase duration vector estimation. We further relax this problem and propose a highly scalable alternating minimization approach with which we can solve problems with millions of users and items. We also show superior prediction accuracies on multiple real-world data sets.",
