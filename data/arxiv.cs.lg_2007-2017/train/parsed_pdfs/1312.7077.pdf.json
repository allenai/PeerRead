      "text" : "Language modeling is the task of estimating the probability of sequences of words in a language and is an important component in, among other applications, automatic speech recognition (Rabiner and Juang, 1993) and machine translation (Koehn, 2010). The predominant approach to language modeling is the n-gram model, wherein the probability of a word sequence P (w1, . . . , w`) is decomposed using the chain rule, and then a Markov assumption is made: P (w1, . . . , w`) ≈∏` i=1 P (wi|w i−1 i−n+1). While this assumption substantially reduces the modeling complexity, parameter estimation remains a major challenge. Due to the power-law nature of language (Zipf, 1949), the maximum likelihood estimator massively overestimates the probability of rare events and assigns zero probability to legitimate word sequences that happen not to have been observed in the training data (Manning and Schütze, 1999).\nMany smoothing techniques have been proposed to address the estimation challenge. These reassign probability mass (generally from overestimated events) to unseen word sequences, whose probabilities are estimated by interpolating with or backing off to lower order n-gram models (Chen and Goodman, 1999).\nSomewhat surprisingly, these widely used smoothing techniques differ substantially from techniques for coping with data sparsity in other domains, such as collaborative filtering (Koren et al., 2009; Su and Khoshgoftaar, 2009) or matrix completion (Candès and Recht, 2009; Cai et al., 2010). In these areas, low rank approaches based on matrix factorization play a central role (Lee and Seung, 2001; Salakhutdinov and Mnih, 2008; Mackey et al., 2011). For example, in recommender systems, a key challenge is dealing with the sparsity of ratings from a single user, since typical users will have rated only a few items. By projecting the low rank representation of a user’s (sparse) preferences into the original space, an estimate of ratings for new items is obtained. These methods are attractive due to their computational efficiency and mathematical well-foundedness.\nIn this paper, we introduce power low rank ensembles (PLRE), in which low rank tensors are used to produce smoothed estimates for n-gram probabilities. Ideally, we would like the low rank structures to discover semantic and syntactic relatedness among words and n-grams, which are used to produce smoothed estimates for word sequence probabilities. In contrast to the few previous low rank language modeling approaches, PLRE is not orthogonal to n-gram models, but rather a general framework where existing n-gram smoothing methods such as Kneser-Ney smoothing are special cases. A key insight is that PLRE does not compute low rank approximations of the original\nar X\niv :1\n31 2.\n70 77\nv2 [\ncs .C\nL ]\n3 O\nct 2\n01 4\njoint count matrices (in the case of bigrams) or tensors i.e. multi-way arrays (in the case of 3-grams and above), but instead altered quantities of these counts based on an element-wise power operation, similar to how some smoothing methods modify their lower order distributions.\nMoreover, PLRE has two key aspects that lead to easy scalability for large corpora and vocabularies. First, since it utilizes the original n-grams, the ranks required for the low rank matrices and tensors tend to be remain tractable (e.g. around 100 for a vocabulary size V ≈ 1 × 106) leading to fast training times. This differentiates our approach over other methods that leverage an underlying latent space such as neural networks (Bengio et al., 2003; Mnih and Hinton, 2007; Mikolov et al., 2010) or soft-class models (Saul and Pereira, 1997) where the underlying dimension is required to be quite large to obtain good performance. Moreover, at test time, the probability of a sequence can be queried in time O(κmax) where κmax is the maximum rank of the low rank matrices/tensors used. While this is larger than Kneser Ney’s virtually constant query time, it is substantially faster than conditional exponential family models (Chen and Rosenfeld, 2000; Chen, 2009; Nelakanti et al., 2013) and neural networks which require O(V ) for exact computation of the normalization constant. See Section 7 for a more detailed discussion of related work.\nOutline: We first review existing n-gram smoothing methods (§2) and then present the intuition behind the key components of our technique: rank (§3.1) and power (§3.2). We then show how these can be interpolated into an ensemble (§4). In the experimental evaluation on English and Russian corpora (§5), we find that PLRE outperforms Kneser-Ney smoothing and all its variants, as well as class-based language models. We also include a comparison to the log-bilinear neural language model (Mnih and Hinton, 2007) and evaluate performance on a downstream machine translation task (§6) where our method achieves consistent improvements in BLEU."

      "text" : "Absolute discounting works on the idea of interpolating higher order n-gram models with lowerorder n-gram models. However, first some probability mass must be “subtracted” from the higher order n-grams so that the leftover probability can be allocated to the lower order n-grams. More specifically, define the following discounted conditional probability:\nP̂D(wi|wi−1i−n+1) = max{c(wi, wi−1i−n+1)−D, 0}\nc(wi−1i−n+1)\nThen absolute discounting Pabs(·) uses the following (recursive) equation:\nPabs(wi|wi−1i−n+1) = P̂D(wi|w i−1 i−n+1)\n+ γ(wi−1i−n+1)Pabs(wi|w i−1 i−n+2)\nwhere γ(wi−1i−n+1) is the leftover weight (due to the discounting) that is chosen so that the conditional distribution sums to one: γ(wi−1i−n+1) =\nD c(wi−1i−n+1) N+(w i−1 i−n+1). For the base case, we set Pabs(wi) = P̂ (wi). Discontinuity: Note that if c(wi−1i−n+1) = 0, then γ(wi−1i−n+1) = 0 0 , in which case γ(w i−1 i−n+1) is set to 1.

Unfortunately, absolute discounting does not satisfy this property, since it exclusively uses the unaltered MLE unigram model as its lower order model. In practice, the lower order distribution is only utilized when we are unsure about the higher order distribution (i.e., when γ(·) is large). Therefore, the unigram model should be altered to condition on this fact.\nThis is the inspiration behind Kneser-Ney (KN) smoothing, an elegant algorithm with robust performance in n-gram language modeling. KN smoothing defines alternate probabilities P alt(·):\nP altD (wi|wi−1i−n′+1) =  P̂D(wi|wi−1i−n′+1), if n ′ = n\nmax{N−(wii−n′+1)−D,0}∑ wi N−(wii−n′+1) , if n′ < n\nThe base case for unigrams reduces to P alt(wi) = N−(wi)∑ wi N−(wi) . Intuitively P alt(wi) is proportional to the number of unique words that precede wi. Thus, words that appear in many different contexts will be given higher weight than words that consistently appear after only a few contexts. These alternate distributions are then used with absolute discounting:\nPkn(wi|wi−1i−n+1) = P alt D (wi|wi−1i−n+1)\n+ γ(wi−1i−n+1)Pkn(wi|w i−1 i−n+2) (2)\nwhere we set Pkn(wi) = P alt(wi).

      "heading" : "3 Power Low Rank Ensembles",
      "text" : "In n-gram smoothing methods, if a bigram count c(wi, wi−1) is zero, the unigram probabilities are used, which is equivalent to assuming that wi and wi−1 are independent ( and similarly for general n). However, in this situation, instead of backing off to a 1-gram, we may like to back off to a “1.5-gram” or more generally an order between 1 and 2 that captures a coarser level of dependence\nbetween wi and wi−1 and does not assume full independence.\nInspired by this intuition, our strategy is to construct an ensemble of matrices and tensors that not only consists of MLE-based count information, but also contains quantities that represent levels of dependence in-between the various orders in the model. We call these combinations power low rank ensembles (PLRE), and they can be thought of as n-gram models with non-integer n. Our approach can be recursively formulated as:\nPplre(wi|wi−1i−n+1) = P alt D0(wi|w i−1 i−n+1)\n+ γ0(w i−1 i−n+1) ( ZD1(wi|wi−1i−n+1) + .....\n+ γη−1(w i−1 i−n+1) ( ZDη(wi|wi−1i−n+1)\n+ γη(w i−1 i−n+1) ( Pplre(wi|wi−1i−n+2) )) ... ) (3)\nwhere Z1, ...,Zη are conditional probability matrices that represent the intermediate n-gram orders1 and D is a discount function (specified in §4).\nThis formulation begs answers to a few critical questions. How to construct matrices that represent conditional probabilities for intermediate n? How to transform them in a way that generalizes the altered lower order distributions in KN smoothing? How to combine these matrices such that the marginal constraint in Eq. 1 still holds? The following propose solutions to these three queries:\n1. Rank (Section 3.1): Rank gives us a concrete measurement of the dependence between wi and wi−1. By constructing low rank approximations of the bigram count matrix and higher-order count tensors, we obtain matrices that represent coarser dependencies, with a rank one approximation implying that the variables are independent.\n2. Power (Section 3.2): In KN smoothing, the lower order distributions are not the original counts but rather altered estimates. We propose a continuous generalization of this alteration by taking the element-wise power of the counts.\n1with a slight abuse of notation, let ZDj be shorthand for Zj,Dj\n3. Creating the Ensemble (Section 4): Lastly, PLRE also defines a way to interpolate the specifically constructed intermediate n-gram matrices. Unfortunately a constant discount, as presented in Section 2, will not in general preserve the lower order marginal constraint (Eq. 1). We propose a generalized discounting scheme to ensure the constraint holds."

      "heading" : "3.1 Rank",
      "text" : "We first show how rank can be utilized to construct quantities between an n-gram and an n− 1-gram. In general, we think of an n-gram as an nth order tensor i.e. a multi-way array with n indices {i1, ..., in}. (A vector is a tensor of order 1, a matrix is a tensor of order 2 etc.) Computing a special rank one approximation of slices of this tensor produces the n− 1-gram. Thus, taking rank κ approximations in this fashion allows us to represent dependencies between an n-gram and n−1-gram.\nConsider the bigram count matrix B with N counts which has rank V . Note that P̂ (wi|wi−1) = B(wi,wi−1)∑\nwB(w,wi−1) . Additionally, B\ncan be considered a random variable that is the result of sampling N tuples of (wi, wi−1) and agglomerating them into a count matrix. Assuming wi and wi−1 are independent, the expected value (with respect to the empirical distribution) E[B] = NP (wi)P (wi−1), which can be rewritten as being proportional to the outer product of the unigram probability vector with itself, and is thus rank one.\nThis observation extends to higher order n-grams as well. Let Cn be the nth order tensor where Cn(wi, ...., wi−n+1) = c(wi, ..., wi−n+1). Furthermore denote Cn(:, w̃i−1i−n+2, :) to be the V × V matrix slice of Cn where wi−n+2, ..., wi−1 are held fixed to a particular sequence w̃i−n+2, ..., w̃i−1. Then if wi is conditionally independent of wi−n+1 given wi−1i−n+2, then E[Cn(:, w̃i−1i−n+2, :)] is rank one ∀w̃ i−1 i−n+2.\nHowever, it is rare that these matrices are actually rank one, either due to sampling variance or the fact that wi and wi−1 are not independent. What we would really like to say is that the best rank one approximation B(1) (under some norm) of B is ∝ P̂ (wi)P̂ (wi−1). While this statement is not true under the `2 norm, it is true under generalized KL divergence (Lee and Seung, 2001): gKL(A||B) =∑\nij\n( Aij log(\nAij Bij\n)−Aij +Bij) ) .\nIn particular, generalized KL divergence preserves row and column sums: if M (κ) is the best rank κ approximation of M under gKL then the row sums and column sums of M (κ) and M are equal (Ho and Van Dooren, 2008). Leveraging this property, it is straightforward to prove the following lemma:\nLemma 1. Let B(κ) be the best rank κ approximation of B under gKL. Then B(1) ∝ P̂ (wi)P̂ (wi−1) and ∀wi−1 s.t. c(wi−1) 6= 0:\nP̂ (wi) = B(1)(wi, wi−1)∑ wB (1)(w,wi−1)\nFor more general n, let Cn,(κ)i−1,...,i−n+2 be the best rank κ approximation of Cn(:, w̃i−1i−n+2, : ) under gKL. Then similarly, ∀wi−1i−n+1 s.t. c(wi−1i−n+1) > 0:\nP̂ (wi|wi−1, ..., wi−n+2)\n= C n,(1) i−1,...,i−n+2(wi, w i−1 i−n+1)∑\nwC n,(1) i−1,...,i−n+2(w,w i−1 i−n+1)\n(4)\nThus, by selecting 1 < κ < V , we obtain count matrices and tensors between n and n − 1-grams. The condition that c(wi−1i−n+1) > 0 corresponds to the discontinuity discussed in §2.2."

Thus, PLRE computes low rank approximations of altered count matrices. Consider taking the elementwise power ρ of the bigram count matrix, which is denoted by B·ρ. For example, the observed bigram count matrix and associated row sum:\nB·1 = ( 1.0 2.0 1.0 0 5.0 0 2.0 0 0 ) row sum→ ( 4.0 5.0 2.0 ) As expected the row sum is equal to the unigram counts (which we denote as u).

Unfortunately, the marginal constraint in Eq. 1 will generally not hold if this strategy is used. Therefore, we propose a generalized discounting scheme where each nonzero n-gram count is associated with a different discount Dj(wi, wi−1i−n′+1). The low rank approximations are then computed on the discounted matrices, leaving the marginal constraint intact.\nFor clarity of exposition, we focus on the special case where n = 2 with only one low rank matrix before stating our general algorithm:\nPplre(wi|wi−1) = P̂D0(wi|wi−1)\n+ γ0(wi−1) ( ZD1(wi|wi−1) + γ1(wi−1)P alt(wi) ) (6)\nOur goal is to compute D0,D1 and Z1 so that the following lower order marginal constraint holds:\nP̂ (wi) = ∑ wi−1 Pplre(wi|wi−1)P̂ (wi−1) (7)\nOur solution can be thought of as a twostep procedure where we compute the discounts D0,D1 (and the γ(wi−1) weights as a byproduct), followed by the low rank quantity Z1.

Assume that ρj ≥ ρj+1. Choose any 0 ≤ d∗ ≤ 1. Set dji,i−1 = d∗c j+1 i,i−1 ∀i, j. The resulting discounts satisfy Eq. 11 as well as the inequality constraints 0 ≤ dji,i−1 ≤ c j i,i−1.

On the other hand, when ρj+1 = 0, Algorithm 1 is equal to the absolute discounting that is used in Kneser-Ney.

Rewriting Eq. 12 in the following form:\nPplre(wi|wi−1i−n+1) = P terms plre (wi|wi−1i−n+1)\n+γ0:η(w i−1 i−n+1)Pplre(wi|w i−1 i−n+2) (13)\nwhere P termsplre (wi|w i−1 i−n+1) contains the terms in Eq. 12 except the last, and γ0:η(wi−1i−n+1) =∏η h=0 γh(w i−1 i−n+1), we can leverage the form of\nthe discount, and using the fact that ρη+1 = 02:\nγ0:η(w i−1 i−n−1) =\nd∗ η+1N+(w i−1 i−n+1)\nc(wi−1i−n+1)\nWith this form of γ(·), Eq. 13 is remarkably similar to KN smoothing (Eq. 2) if KN’s discount parameter D is chosen to equal (d∗)\nη+1. The difference is that P alt(·) has been replaced with the alternate estimate P termsplre (wi|w i−1 i−n+1), which have been enriched via the low rank structure. Since these alternate estimates were constructed via our ensemble strategy they contain both very fine-grained dependencies (the original n-grams) as well as coarser dependencies (the lower rank n-grams) and is thus fundamentally different than simply taking a single matrix/tensor decomposition of the trigram/bigram matrices.\nMoreover, it provides a natural way of setting d∗ based on the Good-Turing (GT) estimates employed by KN smoothing. In particular, we can set d∗ to be the (η + 1)\nth root of the KN discount D that can be estimated via the GT estimates."

      "text" : "PLRE scales well even as the order n increases. To compute a low rank bigram, one low rank approximation of a V × V matrix is required. For the low rank trigram, we need to compute a low rank approximation of each slice Cn,(·p)D (:, w̃i−1, : ) ∀w̃i−1. While this may seem daunting at first, in practice the size of each slice (number of non-zero rows/columns) is usually much, much smaller than V , keeping the computation tractable.\nSimilarly, PLRE also evaluates conditional probabilities at evaluation time efficiently. As shown in Algorithm 2, the normalizer can be precomputed on the sparse powered matrix/tensor. As a result our test complexity is O( ∑ηtotal i=1 κi) where ηtotal is the total number of matrices/tensors in the ensemble. While this is larger than Kneser Ney’s practically constant complexity of O(n), it is much faster than other recent methods for language modeling such as neural networks and conditional exponential family models where exact computation of the normalizing constant costs O(V )."

We evaluated with perplexity in most of our experiments, but also provide results evaluated with BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) on a downstream machine translation (MT) task. We have made the code for our approach publicly available 3.\nTo build the hard class-based LMs, we utilized mkcls4, a tool to train word classes that uses the maximum likelihood criterion (Och, 1995) for classing. We subsequently trained trigram class language models on these classes (corresponding to 2nd-order HMMs) using SRILM (Stolcke, 2002), with KN-smoothing for the class transition probabilities. SRILM was also used for the baseline KN-smoothed models.\nFor our MT evaluation, we built a hierarchical phrase translation (Chiang, 2007) system using cdec (Dyer et al., 2010). The KN-smoothed models in the MT experiments were compiled using KenLM (Heafield, 2011)."

      "text" : "For the class-based baseline LMs, the number of classes was selected from {32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024} (Small-English) and {512, 1024} (Small-Russian). We could not go higher due to the computationally laborious process of hard clustering. For Kneser-Ney, we explore four different variants: back-off (BO-KN) interpolated (int-KN), modified back-off (BOMKN), and modified interpolated (int-MKN). Good-Turing estimates were used for discounts. All models trained on the small corpora are of order 3 (trigrams).\nFor PLRE, we used one low rank bigram and one low rank trigram in addition to the MLE ngram estimates. The powers of the intermediate matrices/tensors were fixed to be 0.5 and the discounts were set to be square roots of the Good Turing estimates (as explained in § 4.4). The ranks were tuned on the development set. For SmallEnglish, the ranges were {1e − 3, 5e − 3} (as a fraction of the vocabulary size) for both the low rank bigram and low rank trigram models. For Small-Russian the ranges were {5e − 4, 1e − 3} for both the low rank bigram and the low rank trigram models.\nThe results are shown in Table 1. The best classbased LM is reported, but is not competitive with the KN baselines. PLRE outperforms all of the baselines comfortably. Moreover, PLRE’s performance over the baselines is highlighted in Russian. With larger vocabulary sizes, the low rank approach is more effective as it can capture linguistic similarities between rare and common words.\nNext we discuss how the maximum n-gram order affects performance. Figure 1 shows the relative percentage improvement of our approach over int-MKN as the order is increased from 2 to 4 for both methods. The Small-English dataset has a rather small vocabulary compared to the number of tokens, leading to lower data sparsity in the bigram. Thus the PLRE improvement is small for order = 2, but more substantial for order = 3. On the other hand, for the Small-Russian dataset, the vocabulary size is much larger and consequently the bigram counts are sparser. This leads to sim-\nilar improvements for all orders (which are larger than that for Small-English).\nOn both these datasets, we also experimented with tuning the discounts for int-MKN to see if the baseline could be improved with more careful choices of discounts. However, this achieved only marginal gains (reducing the perplexity to 98.94 on the Small-English test set and 259.0 on the Small-Russian test set).\nComparison to LBL (Mnih and Hinton, 2007): Mnih and Hinton (2007) evaluate on the Small-English dataset (but remove end markers and concatenate the sentences). They obtain perplexities 117.0 and 107.8 using contexts of size 5 and 10 respectively. With this preprocessing, a 4- gram (context 3) PLRE achieves 108.4 perplexity."

Due to the larger training size, we use 4-gram models in these experiments.

      "heading" : "7 Related Work",
      "text" : "Recent attempts to revisit the language modeling problem have largely come from two directions: Bayesian nonparametrics and neural networks. Teh (2006) and Goldwater et al. (2006) discovered the connection between interpolated Kneser Ney and the hierarchical Pitman-Yor process. These have led to generalizations that account for domain effects (Wood and Teh, 2009) and unbounded contexts (Wood et al., 2009).\nThe idea of using neural networks for language modeling is not new (Miikkulainen and Dyer, 1991), but recent efforts (Mnih and Hinton, 2007; Mikolov et al., 2010) have achieved impressive performance. These methods can be quite expensive to train and query (especially as the vocabulary size increases). Techniques such as noise contrastive estimation (Gutmann and Hyvärinen, 2012; Mnih and Teh, 2012; Vaswani et al., 2013), subsampling (Xu et al., 2011), or careful engineering approaches for maximum entropy LMs (which can also be applied to neural networks) (Wu and Khudanpur, 2000) have improved training of these models, but querying the probability of the next word given still requires explicitly normalizing over the vocabulary, which is expensive for big corpora or in languages with a large number of word types. Mnih and Teh (2012) and Vaswani et al. (2013) propose setting the normalization constant to 1, but this is approximate and thus can only be used for downstream evaluation, not for perplexity computation. An alternate technique is to use word-classing (Goodman, 2001; Mikolov et al., 2011), which can reduce the cost of exact normalization to O( √ V ). In contrast, our approach is much more scalable, since it is trivially parallelized in training and does not require explicit normalization during evaluation.\nThere are a few low rank approaches (Saul and Pereira, 1997; Bellegarda, 2000; Hutchinson et al., 2011), but they are only effective in restricted set-\ntings (e.g. small training sets, or corpora divided into documents) and do not generally perform comparably to state-of-the-art models. Roark et al. (2013) also use the idea of marginal constraints for re-estimating back-off parameters for heavilypruned language models, whereas we use this concept to estimate n-gram specific discounts."
    }, {
      "heading" : "8 Conclusion",
      "text" : "We presented power low rank ensembles, a technique that generalizes existing n-gram smoothing techniques to non-integer n. By using ensembles of sparse as well as low rank matrices and tensors, our method captures both the fine-grained and coarse structures in word sequences. Our discounting strategy preserves the marginal constraint and thus generalizes Kneser Ney, and under slight changes can also extend other smoothing methods such as deleted-interpolation/JelinekMercer smoothing. Experimentally, PLRE convincingly outperforms Kneser-Ney smoothing as well as class-based baselines."

PLRE training is efficient and our approach outperforms stateof-the-art modified Kneser Ney baselines in terms of perplexity on large corpora as well as on BLEU score in a downstream machine translation task.",
