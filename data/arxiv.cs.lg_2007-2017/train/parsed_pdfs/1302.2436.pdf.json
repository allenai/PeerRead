      "text" : "Classification is a supervised learning technique in data mining where training data is given to classifier that builds classification rules. Later if test data, is given to classifier, it will predict the values for unknown classes.\nC4.5 classifier [1],[2], a well-liked tree based classifier, is used to generate decision tree from a set of training examples. Nowadays C4.5 is renamed as J48 classifier in WEKA tool, an open source data mining tool. The heuristic function used in this classifier is based on the concept of information entropy.\nInduction of decision trees from very large training sets has been previously addressed by SLIQ [3] and SPRINT [4], but the data stored is without generalization. The generalization concept for evaluating classification rules using DMQL in data cube is proposed [5]. Decision tree construction process performed on very large datasets leads to bushy or meaningless results. This issue which is addressed in data generalization and summarization based characterization [5], consist of three steps attribute-oriented induction, where the low-level\nDOI : 10.5121/ijist.2013.3103 28\ndata is generalized to high-level data using the concept hierarchies, relevance analysis [6], and multi-level mining, where decision trees can be induced at different levels of abstraction. The integration of these steps leads to efficient, high quality and the elegant handling of continuous and noisy data. An inherent weakness of C4.5 classifier, is that the information gain attribute selection criterion favors many-valued attributes, due to which some of the attributes are pruned because of less information gain in decision tree construction. Ultimately this leads to less classification rules. C4.5 classifier encounters the over-branching problem caused by unnecessary partitioning of the data which is of least importance to users. Therefore, we propose a HeightBalancePriority algorithm which constitutes NodeMerge and HeightBalance algorithms [11] that allows merging of nodes in the decision tree thereby, discouraging over-partitioning of the data. This algorithm also uses the concept of Height Balancing in the decision tree based on priority checks at every node based on attribute values selected for different attributes using information entropy. This enhances the overall performance, as the final decision tree constructed is efficient enough to derive the complete classification rules effectively avoiding over-branching problem of unnecessary attributes.\nIn this paper, we emphasized on decision tree construction and classification rules derived based on priority by using information entropy, which gives importance to selected attributes that was neglected by C4.5 classifier. In the Remainder of the paper, for clarity and better understanding, the Modified DMQL queries are used that explore the dataset used for decision tree construction.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 2, describes the data generalization and summarization based characterization. Section 3 briefly, explains about the proposed algorithms used for decision tree construction. The Decision tree formed using C4.5, yet suffers from deficiencies. To overcome the priority based decision tree construction method is discussed in Section 4. In Section 5, some more examples are taken to explore C4.5, deficiencies and results obtained are compared with proposed approach. Section 6 summarizes the methodology for priority based Decision tree construction and future challenges."

      "heading" : "2.1. Generalization by AOI (Attribute oriented Induction)",
      "text" : "AOI [9], a knowledge discovery tool which allows the generalization of data, offers two major advantages for the mining of large databases. Firstly, it allows the raw data to be handled at higher\nDOI : 10.5121/ijist.2013.3103 29\nconceptual levels. Generalization is performed with the use of attribute concept hierarchies, where the leaves of a given attribute’s concept hierarchy correspond to the attribute’s values in the data (referred to as primitive level data) [10]. Secondly, generalization of the training data is achieved by replacing primitive level data by higher level concepts. Hence, attribute- oriented induction allows the user to view the data at more meaningful abstractions.\nFurthermore, AOI, addresses the scalability issue by compressing the training data. The generalized training data will be much more compact than the original training set, and hence, will involve fewer input/output operations. With the help of AOI, many-valued attributes in the selection of determinant attributes are avoided since AOI reduces large number of attribute values to small set of distinct values according to the specified thresholds.\nAOI also performs generalization by attribute removal [9]. In this technique, an attribute having a large number of distinct values is removed if there is no higher level concept for it. Attribute removal further compact the training data and reduces the bushiness of resulting trees. Hence, aside from increasing efficiency, AOI may result in classification trees that are more understandable, smaller, and therefore easier to interpret than trees obtained from methods operating on non-generalized (larger) sets of low-level data. The degree of generalization is controlled by an empirically set generalization threshold. If the number of distinct values of an attribute is less than or equal to this threshold, then further generalization of the attribute is halted. We consider a simple example to explain all the detail steps to generalize the final classification tree and find out the classification rules. Table 1, depicts a raw training data of class of average education level is used, region wise, with the count in relation with the country part to which that place belongs around the world.\nThe Generalization using AOI for the attribute WORLD is depicted in Figure 1. Similarly the concept hierarchies for age, income, and education can also be represented. We illustrate\nideas of attribute-oriented induction (AOI) with an example for edu_dataset shown in table 1, generalized using the concept hierarchy. AOI is performed on set of relevant\ndata. An intermediate relation, achieved by concept ascension using concept hierarchies as shown in Figure 1, attribute region normalized to country as shown in\nTable 2.

      "text" : "The uncertainty coefficient U(A) for attribute A is used to further reduce the size of the generalized training data as shown in Equation (1). U(A) is obtained by normalizing the information gain of A so that U(A) ranges from 0 (meaning statistical independence between A and the classifying attribute) to 1 (strongest degree of relevance between the two attributes). The user has the option of retaining either the n most relevant attributes or all attributes whose uncertainty coefficient value is greater than a pre-specified uncertainty threshold, where n and the threshold are userdefined. Note that it is much more efficient to apply the relevance analysis to the generalized data rather than to the original training data.\nDOI : 10.5121/ijist.2013.3103 31\n1 2\np\nU(A)= I(p 1 , p 2 ,…, pm,) – E(A) Equation...

For example: we have the attribute A with the generalized final value {a1 ,a2 ,a3 , ...,ak} can be partition P into {C1 ,C2, C3 , ...,Ck} , where Cj contain those samples in C that have value aj of A. The expected information based on partitioning by A is given by E(A) Equation (2), which is the average of the expected information. The Gain(A) given in Equation (3), is the difference of the two calculations. If the uncertainty coefficient for attribute A is 0, which means no matter how we partition the attribute A, we can get nothing lose information. So the attributes A have no effect on the building of the final decision tree. If U(A) is 1, mean that we can use this attribute to classify the final decision tree. This is similar to find the max goodness in the class to find which attribute we can use to classify the final decision tree. After the relevance analysis, we can get rid of some attribute and further compact the training data based on selection of attributes by users. Entropy for income class which has attribute values (High, Medium, Low):\nI(s1,s2,s3)=I(5,5,7)=-\n= [-0.29411764705882 * log2(0.29411764705882)-\n0.29411764705882 * log2(0.29411764705882)0.41176470588235 * log2(0.41176470588235)]\n= 1.56565311164580141944\nIf we want to choose one of the attribute as root node then, we have to calculate Information Entropy for all other attributes present, in the education dataset, in most of cases the continuous values are given preference to be the root node, if not multi-valued attribute values of an attribute is selected as root node. This depends effectively on the highest information gain for the attribute values present in the attributes (Average education level, Region, family income per year). Let us calculate the information gain for all other attributes using equation (1) and equation (2) discussed above. We have to still compute the expected information for each of these distributions For Avg education level = “Illiterate”\ns11=2 ; s21=0; & s31=0\nI(s11,s21,s31)= = 0\nFor Avg education level =”4yearscollege”\ns12=2; s22 =3; &s32=0\nI(s12,s22,s32)=\nFor Avg education level =”2yearscollege” s13=1; s23 =2; & s33=0\nI(s13,s23,s33)=\np\nDOI : 10.5121/ijist.2013.3103 32\nFor Avg education level =”Graduate school”\ns14=3; s24 =0; &s33=0\nI(s14,s24,s34)=\nFor Avg education level =”Elementary school”\ns15=1; s25 =0; & s35=0\nI(s15,s25,s35)=\nSimilarly entropy for attribute values of attribute Avg education level = ”Ph.D”, “High School\", ”Junior High” is 0; Using the equation (2) given above , if the samples are partitioned according to Avg education level, then\nE(Avg education level) =\n= 0.44762470588235\nHence, the gain in information from such a partitioning would be calculated using equation (3) given above:\nGain (Avg education level) = I(s1,s2,s3) – E(Avg education level) =1.56565311164580141944 – 0.44762470588235 = 1.11802840576345141944\nSimilarly, we have calculated Gain(Region)=1.3; Gain(family income per year)=0; We can say that Gain is high for Region, so we have to select Region as root node. After the decision tree is built, tree pruning phase is applied, resulting in removing of the nodes (attributes) which are of user interest from the tree. Cross-validation technique analyzes the final constructed tree that estimate errors, and rebuilds the decision tree as used in WEKA tool discussed in Section 4 and Section 5. Some of the classification rules are skipped resulting in inadequate decision trees. So to avoid the above problems, in our approach, we propose algorithms discussed below (algorithm 4) which give priority preference to the nodes (attributes) for decision tree construction with hidden classification rules by swapping the priorities of attributes discussed in Section 3, and with an example in Section 4. The DMQL queries are used in this paper to understand the propose work clearly, these DMQL queries include our proposed algorithms integrated."

      "text" : "The third step of decision tree construction method is multilevel mining. This combines decision tree induction of the generalized data obtained in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 (Attribute- oriented induction and relevance analysis) with knowledge in the concept hierarchies. The induction of decision trees is done at different levels of abstraction by employing the knowledge stored in the concept hierarchies. Furthermore, once a decision tree has been derived [5], the concept hierarchies can be used to generalize individual nodes in the tree, allowing attribute roll-up or drill- down, and reclassification of the data for the newly specified abstraction level. This depends on information entropy and the selection of attributes by the user.\nThe main idea is to construct a decision tree based on these proposed steps and prune it accordingly based on priority using Height Balancing tree concept [14], without losing any of\nDOI : 10.5121/ijist.2013.3103 33\nthe classification rules. The Decision Tree Construction Algorithm 1 is shown in Figure 2, which constructs a decision tree for the given training data. The stopping criteria, depends not only on maximum information entropy but also selection of the attributes by the users and its priority. In some cases if the attributes selected by the user are not in the data set then thresholds plays a vital role as previously addressed [7] for decision tree construction. Apart from generalization threshold, we used two other thresholds for improving the efficiency namely, exception threshold (€) and classification threshold (ĸ). Because of the recursive partitioning, some resulting data subsets may become so small that partitioning them further would have no statistically significant basis. These “insignificant” data subsets are statistically determined by the exception threshold. If the portion of samples in a given subset is less than the threshold, further partitioning of the subset is halted. Instead, a leaf node is created which stores the subset and class distribution of the subset samples.\nThe splitting-criterion in the Algorithm 1, deals with both the threshold constraints and also information gain calculation for the data. In this process, the candidate with maximum information gain is selected as “test” attribute and is partitioned. The condition, if the frequency of the majority class in a given subset is greater than the classification threshold, or if the percentage of training objects represented by the subset is less than the exception threshold, is used to terminate classification otherwise further classification will be performed recursively until all the attributes are not selected which is of users interest. The algorithm operates on training data that has been generalized to an intermediate level by AOI, and for which unimportant attributes have been removed by relevance analysis, if attributes selected are not present in the users list.\nAlgorithm 1.

But attributes that are selected by the user is given higher preference, next the priority is considered. During this, if the attribute selected by the user has less information entropy in such a case the information entropy is to be replaced by attribute that has highest Information entropy. This continues till all the attributes (which is of users interest) are selected and replaced based on higher information entropy of other attributes which is of least important to users.\nFinally the decision tree is grown with all attributes that is of users interest, with all the classification rules."

The assignment of priorities to attributes is done by evaluating information entropy, at different levels of abstraction for building decision tree using HeightBalancePriority algorithm. Modified DMQL queries are used to understand and explore the shortcomings of the decision trees generated by C4.5 classifier for education dataset and the results are compared with the proposed approach.",
