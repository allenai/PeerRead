      "text" : "Politeness theories (Brown and Levinson, 1987; Gu, 1990; Bargiela-Chiappini, 2003) include key components such as modality, indirection, deference, and impersonalization. Positive politeness strategies focus on making the hearer feel good through offers, promises, and jokes. Negative politeness examples include favor seeking, orders, and requests. Differentiating among politeness types is a highly nontrivial task, because it depends on factors such as a context, relative power, and culture.\nDanescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2013) proposed a useful computational framework for predicting politeness in natural language requests by designing various lexical and syntactic features about key politeness theories, e.g., first or second person start vs. plural. However, manually identifying such politeness features is very challenging, because there exist several complex theories and politeness in natural language is often realized via subtle markers and non-literal cues.\nNeural networks have been achieving high performance in sentiment analysis tasks, via their ability to automatically learn short and long range spatial relations. However, it is hard to interpret and explain what they have learned. In this paper, we first propose to address politeness prediction via simple CNNs working directly on the raw text. This helps us avoid the need for any complex, manuallydefined linguistic features, while still performing better than such featurized systems. More importantly, we next present an intuitive interpretation of what these successful neural networks are learning, using the challenging politeness task as a testbed.\nTo this end, we present several visualization strategies: activation clustering, first derivative saliency, and embedding space transformations, some of which are inspired by similar strategies in computer vision (Erhan et al., 2009; Simonyan et al., 2014; Girshick et al., 2014), and have also been recently adopted in NLP for recurrent neural networks (Li et al., 2016; Kádár et al., 2016). The neuron activation clustering method not only rediscovers and extends several manually defined features from politeness theories, but also uncovers multiple novel strategies, whose importance we measure quantitatively. The first derivative saliency technique allows us to identify the impact of each phrase\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n02 68\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 9\nO ct\n2 01\n6\non the final politeness prediction score via heatmaps, revealing useful politeness markers and cues. Finally, we also plot lexical embeddings before and after training, showing how specific politeness markers move and cluster based on their polarity. Such visualization strategies should also be useful for understanding similar state-of-the-art neural network models on various other NLP tasks.\nImportantly, our activation clusters reveal two novel politeness strategies, namely indefinite pronouns and punctuation. Both strategies display high politeness and top-quartile scores (as defined by Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2013)). Also, when added back as new features to the original featurized system, they improve its performance and reduce the accuracy gap between the featurized system and the neural model, thus providing a clear, quantitative interpretation of the success of these neural networks in automatically learning useful features."

      "text" : "Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2013) presented one of the first useful datasets and computational approaches to politeness theories (Brown and Levinson, 1987; Goldsmith, 2007; Kádár and Haugh, 2013; Locher and Watts, 2005), using manually defined lexical and syntactic features. Substantial previous work has employed machine learning models for other sentiment analysis style tasks (Pang et al., 2002; Pang and Lee, 2004; Kennedy and Inkpen, 2006; Go et al., 2009; Ghiassi et al., 2013). Recent work has also applied neural network based models to sentiment analysis tasks (Chen et al., 2011; Socher et al., 2013; Moraes et al., 2013; Dong et al., 2014; dos Santos and Gatti, 2014; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014). However, none of the above methods focused on visualizing and understanding the inner workings of these successful neural networks.\nThere have been a number of visualization techniques explored for neural networks in computer vision (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Simonyan et al., 2014; Zeiler and Fergus, 2014; Samek et al., 2016; Mahendran and Vedaldi, 2015). Recently in NLP, Li et al. (2016) successfully adopt computer vision techniques, namely first-order saliency, and present representation plotting for sentiment compositionality across RNN variants. Similarly, Kádár et al. (2016)\nanalyze the omission scores and top-k contexts of hidden units of a multimodal RNN. Karpathy et al. (2016) visualize character-level language models. We instead adopt visualization techniques for CNN style models for NLP1 and apply these to the challenging task of politeness prediction, which often involves identifying subtle and non-literal sociolinguistic cues. We also present a quantitative interpretation of the success of these CNNs on the politeness prediction task, based on closing the performance gap between the featurized and neural models."

A feature map c ∈ Rn−t+1 is applied on each possible window of words so that c = [c1, ..., cn−t+1]. This convolutional layer is then followed by a max-over-pooling operation (Collobert et al., 2011) that gives C = max{c} of the particular filter. To obtain multiple features, we use multiple filters of varying window sizes. The result is then passed to a fully-connected softmax layer that outputs probabilities over labels."

We use a simpler train-validation-test split based setup for these datasets instead of the original leave-one-out crossvalidation setup, which makes training extremely slow for any neural network or sizable classifier.2\n1The same techniques can also be applied to RNN models. 2The result trends and visualizations using cross-validation were similar to our current results, in preliminary experiments.

However, we find activations that also react to indefinite pronouns such as something/somebody. Activation cluster examples: {“am i missing something here?”; “wait for anyone to discuss it.”} Punctuation (-) Though non-characteristic in direct speech, punctuation appears to be an important special marker in online communities, which in some sense captures verbal emotion in text.

      "heading" : "6.2 First Derivative Saliency",
      "text" : "Inspired from neural network visualization in computer vision (Simonyan et al., 2014), the first derivative saliency method indicates how much each input unit contributes to the final decision of the classifier. If E is the input embedding, y is the true label, and Sy(E) is the neural network output, then we consider gradients ∂Sy(E)∂e . Each image in Fig. 1 is a heatmap of the magnitudes of the derivative in absolute value with respect to each dimension.\nThe first heatmap gets signals from please (Please strategy) and could you (Counterfactual Modal strategy), but effectively puts much more mass on help. This is presumably due to the nature of Wikipedia requests such that the meaning boils down to asking for some help that reduces the social distance. In the second figure, the highest emphasis is put on why would you, conceivably used by Wikipedia administrators as an indicator of questioning. Also, the indefinite pronoun somebody makes a relatively high impact on the decision. This relates back to the activation clustering mentioned in the previous section, where indefinite pronouns had their own cluster. In the third heatmap, the neural network does not put much weight on the greeting-based start hey, because it instead focuses on the higher polarity6 gratitude part after the greeting, i.e., on the words thanks for. This will be further connected in Sec. 6.3."

Fig. 2 shows that the most positive keys such as hi, appreciate, and great get clustered even more tightly after training. The key thanks gets a notably separated position on a positive spectrum, signifying its importance in the NN’s decision-making (also depicted via the saliency heatmaps in Sec. 6.2).\nThe indefinite pronoun something is located near direct question politeness strategy keys why and what. Please, as was shown by Danescu-NiculescuMizil et al. (2013), is not always a positive word because its sentiment depends on its sentence position, and it moves further away from a positive key group. Counterfactual Modal keys could and would as well as can of indicative modal get far more separated from positive keys. Moreover, after the training, the distance between could and would increases but it gets preserved between can and would, which might suggest that could has a far stronger sentiment."

Our extension Table 2 shows that our novelly discovered Indefinite Pronouns strategy represents a higher percentage (39%), with a politeness score of -0.13. Moreover, our Punctuation strategy also turns out to be a top scoring negative politeness strategy and in the top three among all strategies (after Gratitude and Deference). It has a score of -0.71, whereas the second top negative politeness strategy (Direct Start) has a much lower score of -0.43.\nFinally, in terms of accuracies, our newly discovered features of Indefinite Pronouns and Punctuation improved the featurized system of DanescuNiculescu-Mizil et al. (2013) (see Table 1).7 This reduction of performance gap w.r.t. the CNN partially explains the success of these neural models in automatically learning useful linguistic features."

The key great captures most of the weight for the final decision making. Note that, in particular, the question mark in this case provides no influence. Contrast that to the second figure, which echos back the proposed negative politeness strategy on punctuation from Section 6.1.3. Initial question marks give a high influence in magnitude for the negative predicted label. In the third example, we see that these punctuation markers still provide a lot of emphasis. For instance, other words such as really, successful and a personal pronoun I have very little impact. Overall, this exemplifies Direct Question strategy since most of the focus is on why.\nAs was noted in the embedding space transfor-\nmations discussion, the Gratitude key thanks with a preposition for has a much stronger polarity than other positive politeness keys in the fourth heatmap. Indeed, can you please does not nearly provide as much value. In the fifth heatmap, the sensitivity of the final score comes more from the greeting, namely hi, as compared to the phrase can you please tell me or positive lexicon very nice. These results match the politeness score results in Table 3 of Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil et al. (2013), where the Greeting strategy has a score of 0.87 compared to 0.49 for Please strategy and 0.12 for Positive Lexicon strategy.

Our models are based on simple convolutional neural networks directly on raw text, avoiding any manual identification of complex sentiment or syntactic features, while performing better than such feature-based models from previous work. More importantly, we use the challenging task of politeness prediction as a testbed to next present a much-needed understanding of what these successful networks are actually learning. For this, we present several network visualizations based on activation clusters, first derivative saliency, and embedding space transformations, helping us automatically identify several subtle linguistics markers of politeness theories. Further, this analysis reveals multiple novel, high-scoring politeness strategies which, when added back as new features, reduce the accuracy gap between the original featurized system and the neural model, thus providing a clear quantitative interpretation of the success of these neural networks.",
