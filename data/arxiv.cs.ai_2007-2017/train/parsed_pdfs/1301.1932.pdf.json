The speech is fluent when person’s speech flows easily and smoothly. Sounds combine into syllable, syllables mix together into words and words link into sentences with little effort. When someone’s speech is dyfluent, it is irregular and does not flow effortlessly. Therefore, a dysfluency is a break in the smooth, meaningful flow of speech. Stuttering is one such disorder in which the fluent flow of speech is disrupted by occurrences of dysfluencies such as repetitions, prolongations, interjections and so on. In this work we have considered three types of dysfluencies such as repetition, prolongation and interjection to characterize dysfluent speech. After obtaining dysfluent and fluent speech, the speech signals are analyzed in order to extract MFCC features. The k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are used to classify the speech as dysfluent and fluent speech. The 80% of the data is used for training and 20% for testing. The average accuracy of 86.67% and 93.34% is obtained for dysfluent and fluent speech respectively.\nKEYWORDS\nStuttering, Fluent Speech, MFCC & kNN"

      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Stuttering also known as dysphemia and stammering is a speech fluency disorder that affects the flow of speech. It is one of the serious problems in speech pathology and poorly understood disorder. Approximately about 1% of the population suffering from this disorder and has found to affect four times as many males as females [11, 5, 16, 3]. Stuttering is the subject of interest to researchers from various domains like speech physiology, pathology, psychology, acoustics and signal analysis. Therefore, this area is a multidisciplinary research field of science.\nThe speech fluency can be defined in terms of continuity, rate, co-articulation and effort. Continuity relates to the degree to which syllables and words are logically sequenced and also the presence or absence of pauses. If semantic units follow one another in a continual and logical flow of information, the speech is interpreted as fluent [4]. If there is a break in the smooth, meaningful flow of speech, then it is dysfluent speech. The types of dysfluency that characterize stuttering disorder are shown in Table 1 [6].\nThere are not many clear and quantifiable characteristic to distinguish the dysfluencies of dysfluent and fluent speakers. It was found from literature survey that sound or syllable repetitions, word repetitions and prolongation are sufficient to differentiate them [6, 12].\nThere are number of diagnosis methods to evaluate stuttering. The stuttering assessment process is carried out by transcribing the recorded speech and locating the dysfluencies occurred and counting the number of occurrences. These types of stuttering assessments are based on the knowledge and experience of speech pathologist. The main drawbacks of making such assessment are time consuming, subjective, inconsistent and prone to error.\nIn this work, we are proposing an approach to classify dysfluent and fluent speech using MFCC feature extraction. In order to classify stuttered speech we have considered three types of dyfluencies such as repetition, prolongation and interjection."

The database consists of recording for monologs, readings and conversation. There are 40 different speakers contributing 107 reading recording in the database. In this work speech samples are taken from standard reading of 25 different speakers with age between 10 years to 20 years. The samples were chosen to cover wide range of age and stuttering rate. The repetition, prolongation and filled pause dysfluencies are segmented manually by hearing the speech signal. The segmented samples are subjected to feature extraction. The same standard English passages that were used in UCLASS database are used in preparing the fluent database. Twenty fluent speakers with mean age group of 25 were made to read the passage and recorded using cool edit version 2.1."

It produces a multi dimensional feature vector for every frame of speech. In this study we have considered 12MFCCs. The method is based on human hearing perceptions which cannot perceive frequencies over 1KHz. In other words, MFCC is based on known\n2 ( ) 0.54 0.46cos ,0 1\n1\nn w n n N\nN  = − ≤ ≤ − − \nvariation of the human ear’s critical bandwidth with frequency [7].The block diagram for computing MFCC is given in figure 2.

Hamming window is applied to each frame, which will cause loss of information at the beginning and end of frames. To overcome this overlapping is applied, to reincorporate the information back into extracted feature frames. The frame length is set to 25ms and there is 10ms overlap between two adjacent frames to ensure stationary between frames."

Whereas in frequency domain, the combination becomes the convolution between the short-term spectrum and the transfer function of the window. A good window function has a narrow main lobe and low side lobe levels in their transfer function [9]. The purpose of applying Hamming window is to minimize the spectral distortion and the signal discontinuities. Hamming window function is shown in following equation:\n(3)\nIf the window is defined as w(n), .

A set of overlapping Mel filters are made such that their centre frequencies are equidistant on the Mel scale. The Filter banks can be implemented in both time domain and frequency domain. For the purpose of MFCC processing, filter banks are implemented in frequency domain. The filter bank according to Mel scale is shown in figure 3.\nThe figure 3 shows a set of triangular filters which are used to compute a weighted sum of filter spectral components and the output of the process approximates to a Mel scale. The magnitude frequency response of each filter is triangular in shape and equal to unity at the centre frequency. Also decreases linearly to zero at centre frequency of two adjacent filters. The output of each filter is sum of its filtered spectral components.

Since the speech signal represented as a convolution between slowly varying vocal tract impulse response (filter) and quickly varying glottal pulse (source), the speech spectrum consists of the spectral envelope (low frequency) and the spectral details (high frequency). Now, we have to separate the spectral envelope and spectral details from the spectrum.\nThe logarithm has the effect of changing multiplication into addition. Therefore we can simply convert the multiplication of the magnitude of the Fourier transform into addition by taking the DCT of the logarithm of the magnitude spectrum.\nWe can calculate the Mel frequency cepstrum from the result of the last step using equation 7[13].\n1 (log ) cos , 1, 2, 3, ...\n21 K S n k n Kkn Kk c    ∑= − =    =  (7)\nWhere nc is MFCCi , Sk  is Mel spectrum and K is the number of cepstrum coefficients."

Each query object (test speech signal) is compared with each of training object (training speech signal). Then the object is classified by a majority vote of its neighbors with the object being assigned to the class most common amongst its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of its nearest neighbor [8].\nIn this study minimum distance is calculated from test speech signal to each of the training speech signal in the training set. This classifies test speech sample belonging to the same class as the most similar or nearest sample point in the training set of data. A Euclidean distance measure is used to find the closeness between each training set data and test data. The Euclidean distance measure equation is given by:\n2\n1\n( , ) ( ) n\ne i i i d a b b a =\n= −∑ (8)\nOur aim is to perform two class classification (dysfluent vs. fluent) using the MFCC features.
