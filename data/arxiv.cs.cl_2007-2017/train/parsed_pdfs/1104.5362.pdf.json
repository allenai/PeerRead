      "text" : "A weighted finite-state machine with n tapes (n-WFSM) [33,7,14,10,12] defines a rational relation on n strings. It is a generalization of weighted acceptors (one tape) and transducers (two tapes).\nThis paper investigates the potential of n-ary rational relations (resp. nWFSMs) compared to languages and binary relations (resp. acceptors and transducers), in practical tasks. All described operations and applications have been implemented with Xerox’s WFSC tool [17].\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 recalls some basic definitions about n-ary weighted rational relations and n-WFSMs. Section 3 summarizes some central operations on these relations and machines, such as join and autointersection. Unfortunately, due to Post’s Correspondence Problem, there cannot exist a fully general auto-intersection algorithm. Section 4 recalls a restricted algorithm for a class of n-WFSMs. Section 5 demonstrates the augmented descriptive power of n-WFSMs through a series of practical applications, namely the morphological analysis of Semitic languages (5.1), the preservation of intermediate results in transducer cascades (5.2), the induction of morphological rules from corpora (5.3), the alignment of lexicon entries (5.4), the automatic extraction of acronyms and their meaning from corpora (5.5), and the search for cognates in a bilingual lexicon (5.6).\n⋆ Sections 2–4 are based on published results [18,19,20,4], obtained at Xerox Research Centre Europe (XRCE), Meylan, France, through joint work between Jean-Marc Champarnaud (Rouen Univ.), Jason Eisner (Johns Hopkins Univ.), Franck Guingne and Florent Nicart (XRCE and Rouen Univ.), and the author."

      "text" : "We recall some definitions about n-ary weighted relations and their machines, following the usual definitions for multi-tape automata [7,6], with semiring weights added just as for acceptors and transducers [24,27]. For more details see [18].\nA weighted n-ary relation is a function from (Σ∗)n to K, for a given finite alphabet Σ and a given weight semiring K = 〈K,⊕,⊗, 0̄, 1̄〉. A relation assigns a weight to any n-tuple of strings. A weight of 0̄ can be interpreted as meaning that the tuple is not in the relation. We are especially interested in rational (or regular) n-ary relations, i.e. relations that can be encoded by n-tape weighted finite-state machines, that we now define.\nWe adopt the convention that variable names referring to n-tuples of strings include a superscript (n). Thus we write s(n) rather than → s for a tuple of strings 〈s1, . . . sn〉. We also use this convention for the names of objects that contain n-tuples of strings, such as n-tape machines and their transitions and paths.\nAn n-tape weighted finite-state machine (n-WFSM) A(n) is defined by a sixtuple A(n) = 〈Σ,Q,K, E(n), λ, ̺〉, with Σ being a finite alphabet, Q a finite set of states, K=〈K,⊕,⊗, 0̄, 1̄〉 the semiring of weights, E(n)⊆ (Q× (Σ∗)n×K×Q) a finite set of weighted n-tape transitions, λ : Q → K a function that assigns initial weights to states, and ̺ : Q → K a function that assigns final weights to states.\nAny transition e(n) ∈ E(n) has the form e(n) = 〈y, ℓ(n), w, t〉. We refer to these four components as the transition’s source state y(e(n)) ∈ Q, its label ℓ(e(n))∈ (Σ∗)n, its weight w(e(n))∈K, and its target state t(e(n))∈Q. We refer by E(q) to the set of out-going transitions of a state q∈Q (with E(q)⊆E(n)).\nA path γ(n) of length k ≥ 0 is a sequence of transitions e (n) 1 e (n) 2 · · · e (n) k such\nthat t(e (n) i )=y(e (n) i+1) for all i∈ [1, k−1]. The label of a path is the element-wise concatenation of the labels of its transitions. The weight of a path γ(n) is\nw(γ(n)) =def λ(y(e (n) 1 ))⊗\n  ⊗\nj∈[1,k]\nw (\ne (n) j\n)\n\n⊗ ̺(t(e (n) k )) (1)\nThe path is said to be successful, and to accept its label, if w(γ(n)) 6= 0̄."

Rational operations can\nbe implemented by simple constructions on the corresponding non-deterministic n-tape WFSMs [34]. These n-tape constructions and their semiring-weighted versions are exactly the same as for acceptors and transducers, since they are indifferent to the n-tuple transition labels.\nThe projection operator π〈j1,...jm〉, with j1, . . . jm ∈ [1, n], maps an n-ary relation to an m-ary one by retaining in each tuple components specified by the indices j1, . . . jm and placing them in the specified order. Indices may occur in any order, possibly with repeats. Thus the tapes can be permuted or duplicated: π〈2,1〉 inverts a 2-ary relation. The complementary projection operator π{j1,...jm} removes the tapes j1, . . . jm and preserves the order of other tapes."

Since tapes must explicitly be selected by number, join is neither associative nor commutative.\nFor any distinct i1, . . . ir ∈ [1, n] and any distinct j1, . . . jr ∈ [1,m], we define a join operator ✶{i1=j1,...ir=jr}. It combines an n-ary and an m-ary relation into an (n+m− r)-ary relation defined as follows:1\n(\nR (n) 1 ✶{i1=j1,...ir=jr} R (m) 2\n)\n(〈u1, . . . un, s1, . . . sm−r〉) =def R (n) 1 (u (n))⊗R (m) 2 (v (m)) (2)\nv(m) being the unique tuple s. t. π{j1,...jr}(v (m)) = s(m−r) and (∀k ∈ [1, r]) vjk = uik .\nImportant special cases of join are crossproductR (n) 1 ×R (m) 2 = R (n) 1 ✶ 6© R (m) 2 ,\nintersection R (n) 1 ∩R (n) 2 = R (n) 1 ✶{1=1,...n=n} R (n) 2 , and transducer composition R (2) 1 ◦ R (2) 2 = π{2}(R (2) 1 ✶{2=1} R (2) 2 ).\nUnfortunately, rational relations are not closed under arbitrary joins [18]. Since the join operation is very useful in practical applications (Sec. 5), it is helpful to have even a partial algorithm: hence our motivation for studying autointersection."

      "text" : "For any distinct i1, j1, . . . ir, jr ∈ [1, n], we define an auto-intersection operator σ{i1=j1,i2=j2,...ir=jr}. It maps a relation R (n) to a subset of that relation, preserving tuples s(n) whose elements are equal in pairs as specified, but removing other tuples from the support of the relation.2 The formal definition is:\n( σ{i1=j1,...ir=jr}(R (n)) ) (〈s1, . . . sn〉) =def\n{\nR(n)(〈s1, . . . sn〉) if (∀k∈ [1, r])sik =sjk 0̄ otherwise (3)\n1 For example the tuples 〈abc, def, ǫ〉 and 〈def, ghi, ǫ, jkl〉 combine in the join ✶{2=1,3=3} and yield the tuple 〈abc, def, ǫ, ghi, jkl〉, with a weight equal to the product of their weights. 2 The requirement that the 2r indices be distinct mirrors the similar requirement on join and is needed in (5). But it can be evaded by duplicating tapes: the illegal operation σ{1=2,2=3}(R) can be computed as π{3}(σ{1=2,3=4}(π〈1,2,2,3〉(R))).\nIt is easy to check that auto-intersecting a relation is different from joining the relation with its own projections. Actually, join and auto-intersection are related by the following equalities:\nR (n) 1 ✶{i1=j1,...ir=jr} R (m) 2 = π{n+j1,...n+jr}\n(\nσ{i1=n+j1,...ir=n+jr}( R (n) 1 ×R (m) 2 )\n)\n(4)\nσ{i1=j1,...ir=jr}(R (n)) = R(n) ✶{i1=1,j1=2,...ir=2r−1,jr=2r}\n\n (π〈1,1〉(Σ ∗)×· · ·×π〈1,1〉(Σ ∗)\n︸ ︷︷ ︸\nr times\n\n  (5)\nThus, for any class of difficult join instances whose results are non-rational or have undecidable properties [18], there is a corresponding class of difficult auto-intersection instances, and vice-versa. Conversely, a partial solution to one problem would yield a partial solution to the other.\nAn auto-intersection on a single pair of tapes is said to be a single-pair one. An auto-intersection on multiple pairs of tapes can be defined in terms of multiple single-pair auto-intersections:\nσ{i1=j1,...ir=jr}( R (n) ) =def σ{ir=jr}( · · ·σ{i1=j1}( R (n) ) · · · ) (6)"

Therefore, no partial auto-intersection algorithm can be “complete” in the sense that it always returns a correct n-FSM if it is rational, and always terminates with an error code otherwise. Such an algorithm would make PCP generally decidable since a returned n-FSM can always be tested for emptiness, and an error code indicates non-rationality and hence non-emptiness."

A path has bounded delay if all its prefixes have bounded delay,3 and an nWFSM has bounded delay if all its successful paths have bounded delay.\nAs earlier reported [19], if an n-WFSM A (n) 1 does not contain a path traversing both a cycle with positive and a cycle with negative delay w.r.t. tapes i and j,4 then the delay of all paths of its auto-intersection A(n)=σ{i=j}(A (n) 1 ) is bounded by some δmax〈i,j〉, and this bound can be compiled from A (n) 1 ."

Its annotation, 〈0, 〈ε, ε〉〉, indicates that it is a copy of state 0 and has leftover strings 〈ε, ε〉.

The annotation of state 11\n3 Any finite path has bounded delay (since its label is of finite length). An infinite path (traversing cycles) may have bounded or unbounded delay. For example, the delay of a path labeled with (〈ab, ε〉〈ε, xz〉)h is bounded by 2 for any h, whereas that of a path labeled with 〈ab, ε〉h〈ε, xz〉h is unbounded for h −→ ∞. 4 Note that the n-WFSM may have cycles of both types, but not on the same path.\nindicates that it is a copy of state 0 and has leftover strings 〈a, ε〉. These leftover strings result from concatenating the leftover strings of state 10, 〈ε, ε〉, with the relevant components, 〈a, ε〉, of the transition label a:ε:x. For each newly created state q ∈ QA, we access the corresponding state q1 ∈ QA1 , and copy q1’s outgoing transitions with their target states to A(3), until all states of A(3) have been processed.\nState 12 is not created because the delay of its leftover strings 〈aa, ε〉 exceeds the pre-calculated bound of δmax〈1,2〉 = 1. The longest common prefix of the two leftover strings of a state is removed. Hence state 14 has leftover strings 〈ε, ε〉 instead of 〈a, ε〉〈ε, a〉= 〈a, a〉. A final state is copied with its original weight if it has leftover strings 〈ε, ε〉, and with weight 0̄ otherwise. Therefore, state 14 is final and state 13 is not.\nThe construction is proven to be correct and to terminate [19,20]. It can be performed simultaneously on multiple pairs of tapes."

We do not propose a new method for inducing rules, but rather demonstrate how known steps can be conveniently performed in the framework of n-ary relations.\nLearning morphological rules from a raw corpus can include, among others: (1) generating the least costly rule for a given word pair, that rewrites one word to the other, (2) identifying the set of pairs over all corpus words where a given rule applies, and (3) rewriting a given word by means of one or several rules.\nConstruction of a rule generator For any word pair, such as 〈parler, parlons〉 (French, [to] speak, [we] speak), the generator shall provide a rule, such as “.er:ons”, suitable for rewriting the first to the second word at minimal cost. In a rule, a dot shall mean that one or more letters remain unmodified, and an x:y-part that substring x is replaced by substring y.\nWe begin with a 4-WFSM that defines rewrite operations:\nA (4) 1 = ( 〈〈?, ?, . ,K〉{1=2}, 0〉 ∪ 〈〈?, ε, ?,D〉{1=3}, 0〉 ∪ 〈〈ε, ?, ?, I〉{2=3}, 0〉 ∪ 〈〈ε, ε, : , S〉, 0〉 )∗ (13)\nwhere ? can be instantiated by any symbol, ε is the empty string, {i=j} a constraint requiring the ?’s on tapes i and j to be instantiated by the same symbol [28],5 and 0 a weight over the tropical semiring.\nFigure 4 shows the graph of A (4) 1 and Figure 5 (rows 1–4) the purpose of its tapes: Tapes 1 and 2 accept any word pair, tape 3 generates a preliminary form of the rule, and tape 4 generates a sequence of preliminary operation codes. The following four cases can occur when A (4) 1 reads a word pair (cf. Eq. 13) :\n5 Deviating from [28], we denote symbol constraints similarly to join and autointersection constraints.\nε(?, ,?,D) {1=3} /0 {1=2} /0(?,?,.,K)\n( , ,:,S)ε ε /0 ( ,?,?,I)ε {2=3} /0\nFig. 4.

Mapping from the word pair 〈swum, swim〉 to various sequences\n1. 〈?, ?, . ,K〉{1=2}: two identical letters are accepted, meaning a letter is kept from word 1 to word 2, which is represented by a “.” in the rule and K (keep) in the operation codes,\n2. 〈?, ε, ?,D〉{1=3}: a letter is deleted from word 1 to 2, expressed by this letter in the rule and D (delete) in the operation codes,\n3. 〈ε, ?, ?, I〉{2=3}: a letter is inserted from word 1 to 2, expressed by this letter in the rule and I (insert) in the operation codes\n4. 〈ε, ε, : , S〉: no letter is matched in either word, a “:” is inserted in the rule, and a S (separator) in the operation codes.\nNext, we compile C (1) 1 that constrains the order of operation codes. For example, D must be followed by S, I must be preceded by S, etc. The constraints are enforced through join (Fig. 5 row 4) : A (4) 2 = A (4) 1 ✶{4=1} C (1).\nThen, we create B (2) 1 that maps temporary rules to their final form by replacing a sequence of dots (longest match) by a single dot. We join B (2) 1 with the previous result (Fig. 5 rows 3, 5) : A (5) 3 = A (4) 2 ✶{3=1} B (2) 1 .\nNext, we compile B (2) 2 that creates more fine-grained operation codes. In a sequence of equal capital letters, it replaces each but the first one with its small form. For example, DDD becomes Ddd. B (2) 1 is joined with the previous result (Fig. 5 rows 4, 6) : A (6) 4 = A (5) 3 ✶{4=1} B (2) 2 .\nC (1) 1 , B (2) 1 , and B (2) 2 can be compiled as unweighted automata with a tool\nsuch as Xfst [13,2] and then be enhanced with neutral weights.\nFinally, we assigns weights to the fine-grained operation codes by joining\nB (1) 3 = (〈K, 1〉 ∪ 〈k, 0〉 ∪ 〈D, 4〉 ∪ 〈d, 2〉 ∪ 〈I, 4〉 ∪ 〈i, 2〉 ∪ 〈S, 0〉) ∗ with the previous result (Fig. 5 rows 6, 7) : A (6) 5 = A (6) 4 ✶{6=1} B (1) 3 .\nWe keep only the tapes of the word pair and of the final rule in the generator (Fig. 5 rows 1, 2, 5). All other tapes are of no further use:\nG(3) = π〈1,2,5〉\n(\nA (6) 5\n)\n(14)\nThe rule generator G(3) maps any word pair to a finite number of rewrite rules with different weight, expressing the cost of edit operations. The optimal rule (with minimal weight) can be found through n-tape best-path search [16].\nUsing rewrite rules We suppose that the rules generated from random word pairs undergo some statistical selection process that aims at retaining only meaningful rules.\nTo facilitate the following operations, a rule’s representation can be changed from a string, such as s(1)=“.er:ons”, to a 2-WFSM r(2) encoding the same relation. This is done by joining the rule with the generator: r(2) = π〈1,2〉 ( G(3) ✶{3=1} s (1) ) . An r(2) resulting from “.er:ons”, accepts (on tape 1) only words ending in “er” and changes (on tape 2) their suffix to “ons”. Similarly, a 2-WFSM R(2) that encodes all selected rules can be generated by joining the set of all rules (represented as strings) S(1) with the generator: R(2) = π〈1,2〉 ( G(3) ✶{3=1} S (1) ) .\nTo find all pairs P (2) of words from a corpus where a particular rule applies, we compile the automaton W (1) of all corpus words, and compose it on both tapes of r(2) : P (2) = W (1) ◦ r(2) ◦ W (1). Similarly, identifying all word pairs P ′ (2) over the whole corpus where any of the rules applies (i.e., the set of “valid” pairs) can be obtained through: P ′ (2) = W (1) ◦R(2) ◦W (1)\nRewriting a word w(1) with a single rule r(2) is done by w (1) 2 = π〈2〉(w (1) 1 ◦ r (2))\nand w (1) 1 = π〈1〉(r (2) ◦ w (1) 2 ). Similarly, rewriting a word w (1) with all selected rules is done by W (1) 2 = π〈2〉(w (1) 1 ◦R (2)) and W (1) 1 = π〈1〉(R (2) ◦ w (1) 2 )."

For example, A (5) 1 will map 〈swum, swim〉, among others, to 〈swu@m, sw@im〉 with KKDIK and to 〈sw@um, swi@m〉 with KKIDK. To remove redundant (duplicated) alignments, we prohibit an insertion to be immediately followed by a deletion, via the constraint: C(1) = (K ∪ I ∪D)∗ − (?∗ I D ?∗). The constraint is imposed through join and the operations tape is removed:\nAligner(4) = π{5}\n(\nA (5) 1 ✶{5=1} C\n(1) )\n(16)\nThe Aligner(4) will map 〈swum, swim〉 among other still to 〈swu@m, sw@im〉 but no to 〈sw@um, swi@m〉. The best alignment (with minimal weight) can be found through n-tape best-path search [16]."

      "text" : "The automatic extraction of acronyms and their meaning from corpora is an important sub-task of text mining, and received much attention [37,32,35, e.g.].\nIt can be seen as a special case of string alignment between a text chunk and an acronym. For example, the chunk “they have many hidden Markov models” can be aligned with the acronym “HMMs” in different ways, such as “they have many hidden Markov models” or “they have many hidden Markov models”. Alternative alignments have different cost, and ideally the least costly one should give the correct meaning.\nAn alignment-based approach can be implemented by means of a 3-WFSM that reads a text chunk on tape 1 and an acronym on tape 2, and generates all possible alignments on tape 3, inserting dots to mark letters used in the acronym. For the above example this would give “they have many .hidden .Markov .model.s”, among others.\n6 Later, we simply replace in D(2) all @ by ε.\nThe 3-WFSM can be generated from n-ary regular expressions that define the task in as much detail as required (cf. Sec. 5.3 and 5.4). For a detailed description see [15]. The best alignment, i.e., the most likely meaning of an acronym is found through n-tape best-path search [16].\nThe advantage of aligning via a n-WFSM rather than a classical alignment matrix [36,30] is that the n-WFSM can be built from regular expressions that define very subtle criteria, such as disallowing certain alignments or favoring others based on weights that depend on long-distance context."

We create a similarity automaton S(2) that describes through weights the degree of similarity between English and German words. This can either be expressed through edit distance (cf. Sec. 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5) or through weighted synchronic grapheme correspondences (e.g.: d-t, ght-cht, th-d, th-ss, . . .) : S(2) = ( 〈〈?, ?〉{1=2}, w0〉 ∪ 〈〈d , t〉, w1〉 ∪ 〈〈ght , cht〉, w2〉 ∪ . . . )∗ When recognizing an English-German word pair, S(2) accepts either any two equal symbols in the two words (via 〈?, ?〉{1=2}) or some English sequence and its German correspondence (e.g. ght and cht) with some weight.\nThe set of cognates EG(3)cog is obtained by joining the dictionary with the\nsimilarity automaton: EG(3)cog = EG (3) ✶{1=1,2=2} S (2) EG(3)cog contains all (and only) the cognates with equal meaning in EG (3) such as 〈daughter, tochter, noun〉, 〈eight, acht, num〉, or 〈light, leicht, adj〉. Weighs of triples express similarity of words.\nNote that this result cannot be achieved through ordinary transducer composition. For example, composing S(2) with the English and the German words separately: π〈1〉(EG (3)) ⋄ S(2) ⋄ π〈2〉(EG (3)), also yields false cognates such as 〈become, bekommen〉 ([to] obtain)."

      "text" : "The paper recalled basic definitions about n-ary weighted relations and their nWFSMs, central operations on these relations and machines, and an algorithm for the important auto-intersection operation.\nIt investigated the potential of n-WFSMs, w.r.t. classical 1- and 2-WFSMs (acceptors and transducers), in practical tasks. Through a series of applications, it exposed their augmented descriptive power and the importance of the join operation. Some of the applications are not feasible with 1- or 2-WFSMs.\nIn the morphological analysis of Semitic languages, n-WFSMs have been used to synchronize the vowels, consonants, and templatic pattern into a surface form. In transduction cascades consisting of n-WFSMs, intermediate result can\nbe preserved and used by subsequent transductions. n-WFSMs permit not only to map strings to strings or string m-tuples to k-tuples, but m-ary to k-ary string relations, such as an non-aligned word pair to its aligned form, or to a rewrite rule suitable for mapping one word to the other. In string alignment tasks, an n-WFSM provides better control over the alignment process than a classical alignment matrix, since it can be compiled from regular expressions defining very subtle criteria, such as long-distance dependencies for weights."
