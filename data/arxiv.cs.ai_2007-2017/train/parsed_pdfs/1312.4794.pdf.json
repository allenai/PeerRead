      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Currently, despite the large amounts of documents and resources available online, semantic analysis is not enough supported by internet search engines (they typically match words syntactically). However, the requirement of massive metadata for the web content allows various Semantic Web applications to appear and gain broad approval. A typical Web application would provide and use new access methods based on the associated metadata. The Semantic Web was devised by Tim Berners-Lee as a network that includes a content semantically-enriched which contains links to explicit, formal semantics. A good number of the semantic content available has been generated automatically by the mean of wrapping or by using annotation services. However, Semantic Web success depends on the accomplishment of a great number of users creating and exploiting semantic content. This achievement requires tools that reduce the complexity of semantic technologies. Various IE technologies are currently available allowing named entity recognition within the text, events, relations and scenarios in which they exist. Metadata assigned to a document can range from author reference of the document, to annotations of all the entities referred to in the text. To make this metadata readable by machines for effective structuring, discovery, automation, integration, and reuse is an important issue in semantic research. Based on the category of annotation, the automatic (versus manual) extraction of metadata approach is scalable, author-independent, and not expensive and enriches the web content of a specific user. At present, the technology available to provide automatic semantic annotation is not yet mature to achieve intuitive, scalable, and accurate model for generation and representation of such annotations. This paper presents first a comprehensive introduction to Semantic Web (layers and content enrichment of web resources). Semantic annotation categories (manual, semiautomatic and automatic annotation) are presented in sections 3. Section 4 offers a brief explanation of the semantic annotation models and domains. Some existing annotation tools classified by text, images and ontologies are described in\nthe section 5. Finally, section 6 gives a conclusion with perspectives for future work."

      "heading" : "2. SEMANTIC WEB INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "The Semantic Web is a vision created by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the WWW [1]. The success of the current WWW leads to a new challenge: A huge number of data is only human understandable; machine support is limited or absent. Berners-Lee suggests mechanisms to describe data in Semantic Web terms which will facilitate applications to exploit data (machine processable) in more ways and support the user in his task. The relevant pages and can thus improve both precision and recall. The definition of a Semantic Web structure is crucial. The structure has to be defined, and then has to be filled with life. To do this task, one should start with the easier tasks first. The following steps show the direction where the Semantic Web is heading:\n Provide a common syntax for machine understanding.  Create common vocabularies.  Support logical language  Use the language for exchanging proofs.\nThe layer structure of the Semantic Web suggested by Tim Berners-Lee reflects the previous steps that follow the understanding that each step alone will already add value, so that the Semantic Web can be implanted in an incremental approach."

      "heading" : "2.1 Layers of Semantic Web",
      "text" : "The layers of Semantic Web suggested by Berners-Lee is a\nstack which shows how technologies that are standardized for\nthe Semantic Web are organized to make the Semantic Web\npossible. This architecture is discussed in detail in [2] and [3],\nwhich also address recent research issues (Figure 1):\nThe bottom layers contain technologies providing common\nsyntax. Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) provides means for uniquely identifying semantic web resources (entities)1 , while\nUnicode serves to represent and manipulate text in many\nlanguages useful for exchanging symbols. The Extensible\nMarkup Language (XML) is a markup language that enables\ncreation of documents composed of structured data, and XML\nSchema allows the definition of grammars for valid XML\ndocuments. Semantic web gives meaning (semantics) to\nstructured data. XML documents can refer to different\nnamespaces to make explicit the context (and therefore\nmeaning) of different tags. XML Namespaces provide a way\nto use markups from more sources. Semantic Web aims to\nconnect data together, which needs to refer more sources in\none document.\nThe explained two layers are nowadays broadly accepted, and\nthe number of XML documents is growing quickly. XML is\nthe first step in the right direction, but it only formalizes the\nstructure of a document and not its content. The Resource Description Framework (RDF)2 is a framework for creating\nstatements in a form denoted by triples. This form enables the\nrepresentation of information about resources in the form of\ngraph and can be seen as the first layer where information\nbecomes machine understandable: According to the W3C recommendation3, RDF “is a foundation for processing\nmetadata; it provides interoperability between applications\nthat exchange machine understandable information on the\nWeb”. The components of each RDF document consist of\nthree types of entities: Resources (subjects and objects),\nproperties (predicates/relations). Resources represent Web\npages, parts or set of Web pages, or anything (real-world\nobject) that can have a URI. Properties are specific attributes,\nor relations describing resources. The combination of a\nresource together with a property having a value for that\nresource forms a Statement (known as the subject, predicate\nand object). A value is either a literal, a resource, or other\nstatement. A Statement which may be represented as a triple\nof the form (Subject, Property, Object) asserts that a resource\nrecognized by the subject, has a property whose value is the\n1 Refers to a locatable URI, e.g., an http://www.w3schools.com/RDF address. It is often used as a synonym, although URLs are a subclass of URIs, see http://www.w3.org/Addressing 2 http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/ 3 http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax-grammar-20040210/\nrecognized by the object (either another resource or a literal).\nConsequently, a property is a binary relationship between two\nresources or between a resource and a literal value. Figure 2\nshows an example of RDF statements. Two of the Researcher\nof the “ASSW project” (i.e., their Web pages) are represented\nas resources „URI-Mam‟ and „URI-Ram‟. On the lower right\nof Figure 2, the statement consists of the resource „URI-Mam‟\nand the property „cooperates-with‟ with the value „URI-Ram‟\n(resource). The resource ‟URI ASSW‟ has as value for the\nproperty „title‟ the literal “Annotation System for Semantic\nWeb”.\nRDF is basically a directed graph with labelled edges and\npartially labelled nodes. The definition of a simple modelling\nlanguage on top of RDF is realized by the RDF Schema (RDFS)4 which includes classes, IS-a relationships between\nclasses and properties, and properties characterized by\ndomain/range restrictions. RDF and RDF Schema are\nstructured in XML syntax, but they do not use the tree\nsemantics of XML. An extension of RDFS including more\nadvanced constructs to describe semantics of RDF statements\nbased on description logic is provided by Web Ontology\nLanguage (OWL)[4]. It allows states additional constraints,\nsuch as for example cardinality, value restrictions, or\ncharacteristics of properties such as transitivity. The ontology\nvocabulary denotes the next layer. Gruber [5], define an\nontology as ”an explicit formalization of a shared\nunderstanding of a conceptualization”. Most of the definitions\nrealized by different research communities share a certain\nunderstanding in common: That means, ontology is a formal\nmodel which explicitly represents the consensual knowledge\nof a domain. The domain entities are modelled through a set\nof concepts, a hierarchy on them, and relations between\nconcepts. By instantiating these ontological concepts, concrete\nfacts and information items which can be stored in the\nontology. Most of these definitions also include axioms in\nsome specific logic. The core of own ontology definition is\npresented in the following section.\nAt the layer of ontology vocabulary it is possible to query any RDF-based data (i.e., including statements involving RDFS and OWL) with the use of the latest RDF query language (SPARQL) [6]. According to Berners-Lee, the next layer is Logic. Nowadays, the integration between ontology and the logic levels is treated by the most researchers. This integration is encouraged by the ability of the most ontologies to allow for logical axioms. With the applicability of logical deduction, we can infer new knowledge from the information which is stated explicitly. For instance, the axiom given above allows to logically infer that the researcher addressed by ‟URI-RAM‟ cooperates with the researcher addressed by ‟URI-MAM‟. The feasibility of the type of inference depends deeply on the logics chosen."

The top layers contain technologies that are not yet standardized which require the ability to check the validity of the statements made in the (Semantic) Web, and Trust to derive statements will be supported by (a) verifying that the premises come from trusted sources and by (b) relying on formal logic during deriving new information. Consequently, the way it processes information will increase in the presence of validated statements. Then, the author must provide a proof which should be provable by a machine. At this level, it is not required that the machine of the reader finds the proof, but he needs only to check the proof given by the author. These two layers are rarely undertaken in current research."

      "text" : "Semantic annotation is the process that creates semantic labels of documents for the semantic Web, aiming to support advanced searching (based on concepts), reasoning about Web resources and the information visualization based on ontology. Additionally annotation is used to convert syntactic structures into knowledge structures. In other terms, semantic\nannotation consists to generate specific metadata and usage schema, enabling new information access methods and extending the existing ones.\nIn a nutshell, Semantic Annotation is about assigning to the entities in the text links to their semantic descriptions (as presented in Figure 3). Several types of annotation models are accessible in the literature and in the existing end-user applications. The models of semantic Web community have been abstracted by the Subject-Object-Predicate triple usefully for most of the annotation kind discussed here."

      "heading" : "3.1 Manual Annotation",
      "text" : "Manual annotation (MA) is a methodology that transforms the existing syntactic resources into interlinked knowledge structures by adding information to some level of document (word, phrase or paragraph) which constitutes metadata. The process of manual annotation is expensive, and regularly does not consider that multiple standpoints of a data source, involving multiple ontologies, can be useful to support the requirements of different users. Furthermore, MA is more easily feasible today, by means of authoring tools such as Semantic Word. MA is more precise compared to automatic annotation, but is very labor-intensive. As an example of manual annotation, in Protégé, a user can create an instance each time he wants to annotate by the selection of a piece of text in the loaded document and the class selection from the loaded ontology. As another example, in clinical documents, the instances that occur at different locations in the document actually refer to the same real world entity. Such annotations on equivalences can be valuable to deduce new knowledge and useful for medical care related applications [7]. The instance relationship annotation is another important type of annotation. Semantator [8] is an example of a tool that allows users to create a single relationship between two instances at a time. Semantator allows a given user to select two instances and add them to the relationship candidate list. After that, he can choose any object property from the loaded ontology and decide the subject of this new relationship. Another important type of annotation is instance relationship annotation allowing users to create a single relationship between two instances at a time."

      "heading" : "3.2 Semi-automatic Semantic Annotation",
      "text" : "The semi-automatic annotation process needs human intervention at some annotation level. This category of annotation systems differs in their architecture, methods and tools of information extraction, the manual work amount required to achieve annotation, performance, storage management and other features. GATE is an example of tools that performs semi-automatic annotation. The NCBO annotator [9] and cTAKES [10] are two other tools using semi-automatic annotation, in addition to Semantator. Similarly to that supported by NCBO annotator, cTAKES tool is used in Semantator for semi-automatic annotation. In a different manner to NCBO annotator, cTAKES is designed for clinical domain, uses NLP techniques and supports negation and time constraints. Currently, cTAKES allows annotation with the SNOMED CT and RxNorm dictionaries."

      "heading" : "3.3 Automatic Semantic Annotation",
      "text" : "Automated annotation of web documents is an important task in the Semantic Web effort. Semantic metadata created using automated annotation or tagging tools accompanied with best results are built on various machine learning algorithms which\nneed training sets. Automated annotation tools can afford semantic metadata for semantic web and knowledge management [11]. Automatic semantic annotation can be realized on the base of automatic annotating algorithms: such as PANKOW (Pattern-based Annotation through Knowledge On the Web) and C-PANKOW (Context-driven and Pattern based Annotation through Knowledge on the Web) [12] for texts using Qtag5 patterns and Google API. Additionally, Automatic semantic annotation can be based on statistical algorithms for image and video annotations. Nevertheless, current annotations based on automatic algorithms need to be improved and corrected. As an interesting tool for automatic semantic annotation, AeroDAML [13] loads a specific ontology and automatically produces the corresponding semantically marked up page which can then be checked by a human. KIM6 [14], for example, is an automatic semantic annotation platform which uses information extraction based on GATE7 [15] information extraction system, GATE with Annie8 extension. SemTag [16] is the distinguished semantic annotation solution that operates within the distributed architecture and capability to process large scale data. To support annotation tasks, SemTag uses the Seeker [16] information retrieval platform and annotate web pages using Stanford TAP ontology [17]. Additionally, SemTag allows identifying but not creating new instances in the ontology. Ontea [18] is a platform for pattern based automated semantic annotation which allows pattern implementation over regular expressions, the implementation or integration of other methods based on patterns such as wrappers, solutions using structure of document, XPath, language patterns, e.g. CPANKOW or GATE."

      "heading" : "4.1 Semantic Annotation Models",
      "text" : "Semantic Annotation may be classified into four models: tags, attributes, relations and ontologies. Tags are located at the bottom level and correspond to the easiest form of annotation from the user point of view; while ontologies are at the top level and represent the hardest form of annotation from the user point of view.\n Tags: A tag annotation element is a keyword (word or sequence of characters without spaces) or a term\nassigned to a resource that, implicitly, describes a particular property of a resource. The annotation meaning planned by the annotator is not known by the computer and other users, only if the natural language used is unambiguous. The place names where picture are taken, the name of the person on a picture, or the topic of a news article are examples of tag.\n Attributes: An attribute annotation element is a pair of two elements: the name of the attribute and\nthe value of the attribute. The name of the attribute defines the property of the annotated resource (e.g.,\n5 http://www.english.bham.ac.uk/staff/ omason/software/qtag.html 6 http://www.ontotext.com/kim/semanticann otation.html 7 http://gate.ac.uk/ 8 http://gate.ac.uk/ie/annie.html\n“Country”, “birthdate”) and the attribute value specifies the corresponding value (e.g., “Tunisia”, “1909”).\n Relations: a relation annotation element is a pair of two components: the relation name and the related\nresource. The annotated resource is related with relation by the relation name. In other words, the model of relation annotation is an extension of the model of attribute annotation to the domain of resources, allowing the user to interconnect these resources. For example, a citation referencing another paper in given scientific paper is an example of the annotation of relation defining a link between these documents.\n Ontologies: The ontology model describes the metadata that align a resource or a part of it with\nsome of its properties and characteristics description according to a formal conceptual model (ontology). As defined by Studer et al., “an ontology is an explicit specification of a (shared) conceptualization” [5]. Ontologies are useful for domain knowledge capturing (in a generic manner) and the specification of a commonly granted understanding of a domain (that may be reused and shared within communities or applications). The design of ontologies may be realized with the following elements: concepts notion, concepts instances, concepts and instances properties, restrictions on these properties, relations between concepts and relations between instances. The user that use ontology annotation model is able to describe and connect existing resources by the resources structuring (concepts or as instances) and by the definition of the restrictions that hold between relations and properties."

      "heading" : "4.2 Annotation Domains",
      "text" : "Annotation domains were classified to document annotations, semantic wikis, semantic blogs, and tagging. A short introduction to each annotation domain with the specification of the associated role is presented in the following sections:\n Document annotations: Annotations of documents is the attachment of comments, notes, explanations,\nor other types of external remarks to a Web document or to a selected part of a document. Annotation of document can be realized manually (performed by user(s)), semi-automatic by\nautomatic suggestions, or completely automatic.  Semantic Wikis: Wiki can be defines as an\nenvironment for collaborative hypertext authoring that allows people collecting, describing, and authoring information in a collaborative manner. As a promising tools, semantic Wikis allow users to make formal descriptions of resources (wiki pages) enabling metadata insertions through semantic annotations and link relations between those resources. They need ontologies as conceptual models for their content organization. Annotations are needed to refer to an ontological model which defines concepts and properties associated to pieces\nof wiki contents.  Semantic Blogs: A blog is a web site or online\njournal including comments, reflections and a lot of hyperlinks provided by the writer, but presented in reverse chronological order. However, the success\nof blogging can be reinforced when it accompanied with machine-readable content (annotation) which is beneficial of blog content consumers. Most commonly, an annotation in blogs is a statement about a post. For example, while a blog solution allows the classification of posts with simple categories or topics such as “research”, “teaching”; we can say that blog posts are annotated with these categories. The process that transform blogs from simple online record to full participants in an information sharing network exploiting the metadata richness is called semantic blogging.\n Tagging: Organizing electronic content in a collaborative form by marking content with\ndescriptive terms (tagging by keywords or tags) is a common way for future navigation, filtering or search. The tags express some undetermined relation between the resource and whatever the term refers to. As an example, del.icio.us9, Technorati10 or Flickr11 are three tagging systems allowing users to associate one or more tags to a web resource."

AktiveDoc provides Semi-automatic annotation of content based on Amilcare. AktiveDoc is able to provide automatic suggestions about relevant content, given its design for knowledge reuse. ActiveDoc functionality is extended to free text, in addition to filling forms functionality and other predetermined structures.\n Magpie [36]: Magpie is a real-time annotation of web resources that relates text strings to ontology\nconcepts of the user‟s choice. With Magpie, an appropriate web service can be linked to highlighted strings. Even though, the annotation of documents is automatic, Magpie has the disadvantage to produce manually the lexicons specific parts of text strings subjects for each ontology.
