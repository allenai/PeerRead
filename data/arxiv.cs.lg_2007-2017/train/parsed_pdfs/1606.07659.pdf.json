      "text" : "Recommendation systems advise users on which items (movies, musics, books etc.) they are more likely to be interested in. A good recommendation system may dramatically increase the amount of sales of a firm or retain customers. For instance, 80% of movies watched on Netflix come from the recommender system of the company [8]. One efficient way to design such algorithm is to predict how a user would rate a given item. Two key methods co-exist to tackle this issue: Content-Based Filtering (CBF) and Collaborative Filtering (CF).\nCBF uses the user/item knowledge to estimate a new rating. For instance, user information can be the age, gender, or graph of friends etc. Item information can be the movie genre, a short description, or the tags. On the other side, CF uses the ratings history of users and items. The feedback of one user on some items is combined with the feedback of all other users on all items to predict a new rating. For instance, if someone rated a few books, Collaborative Filtering aims at estimating the ratings he would have given to thousands of other books by using the ratings of all the other readers. CF is often preferred to CBF because it wins the agnostic vs. studied contest: CF only relies on the ratings of the users while CBF requires advanced engineering\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of part or all of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

The most successful approach in CF is to retrieve potential latent factors from the sparse matrix of ratings. Book latent factors are likely to encapsulate the book genre (spy novel, fantasy, etc.) or some writing styles. Common latent factor techniques compute a low-rank rating matrix by applying Singular Value Decomposition through gradient descent [10] or Regularized Alternating Least Square algorithm [39]. However, these methods are linear and cannot catch subtle factors. Newer algorithms were explored to face those constraints such as Factorization Machines [25]. More recent works combine several low-rank matrices such as Local Low Rank Matrix Approximation [16] or WEMAREC [3] to enhance the recommendation.\nAnother limitation of CF is known as the cold start problem: how to recommend an item to a user when no rating exists for either the user or the item? To overcome this issue, one idea is to build a hybrid model mixing CF and CBF where side information is integrated into the training process. The goal is to supplant the lack of ratings through side information. A successful approach [1, 24] extends the Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization Framework [26] to integrate side information. However, recent algorithms outperform them in the general case [17].\nIn this paper we introduce a CF approach based on Stacked Denoising Autoencoders [35, 40] which tackles both challenges: learning a non-linear representation of users and items, and alleviating the cold start problem by integrating side information. Compared to previous attempts in that direction [27, 28, 30, 5, 38], our framework integrates the sparse matrix of ratings and side information in a unique Network. This joint model leads to a scalable and robust approach which beats state-of-the-art results in CF. Reusable source code is provided in Lua/Torch to reproduce the results. Last but not least, we show that CF approaches based on Matrix Factorization have a strong link with our approach.\nThe paper is organized as follows. First, Sec. 2 fixes the setting and gives state of the art on related approaches. Then, our model is described in Sec. 3. Finally, experimental results are given and discussed in Sec. 4 and Sec. 5 discusses algorithmic aspects."

      "text" : "A standard setting for CF is Matrix Completion [10]. Given N users andM items, the rating rij is the rating given\nby the ith user for the jth item. It entails a matrix of ratings R ∈ RN×M , for which only a few entries are known. The goal of Matrix Completion is to infer the unknown value. Namely, the algorithm returns a matrix R̂ ∈ RN×M which hopefully minimizes the reconstruction error\nL(R, R̂) = ∑\n(i,j)/∈K(R) (rij − r̂ij)\n2 ,\nwhere K(R) is the set of indices of known ratings of R."

      "heading" : "2.2 Denoising Autoencoders",
      "text" : "The proposed approach builds upon Autoencoders which are feed-forward Neural Networks popularized by Kramer [11]. They are unsupervised Networks where the output of the Network aims at reconstructing the initial input. The Network is trained by back-propagating the squared error loss on the reconstruction. When the network limits itself to one hidden layer, its output is given by\nnn(x) def = σ(W2σ(W1x+ b1) + b2),\nwith x ∈ RN the input, W1 ∈ R k×N and W2 ∈ R N×k the weight matrices, b1 ∈ R k and b2 ∈ R N the bias vectors, and σ(.) a non-linear transfer function. The size k ≪ N of the hidden layer is also known as the Autoencoder’s bottleneck.\nRecent work in Deep Learning advocates to stack pretrained encoders to initialize Deep Neural Networks [6]. This process enables the lowest layers of the Network to find lowdimensional representations. It experimentally increases the quality of the whole Network. Yet, classic Autoencoders may degenerate into identity Networks and they fail to learn the latent relationship between data. [35] tackle this issue by corrupting inputs, pushing the Network to denoise the final outputs. One method is to add Gaussian noise on a random fraction of the input. Another method is to mask a random fraction of the input by replacing them with zero. In this case, the Denoising AutoEncoder (DAE) loss function is modified to emphasize the denoising aspect of the Network. The loss is based on two main hyperparameters α, β. They balance whether the Network would focus on denoising the input (α) or reconstructing the input (β):\nLα,β(x, x̃) = α\n  ∑\nj∈C(x̃) [nn(x̃)j − xj ]\n2\n\n+\nβ\n  ∑\nj 6∈C(x̃) [nn(x̃)j − xj ]\n2\n\n ,\nwhere x̃ ∈ RN is a corrupted version of the input x, C is the set of corrupted elements in x̃, and nn(x)j is the j\nth output of the Network while fed with x."

      "text" : "Neural Networks have attracted little attention in the CF community. In a preliminary work, [27] tackled the Netflix challenge using Restricted Boltzmann Machines but little published work had follow [33]. While Deep Learning has tremendous success in image and speech recognition [13], sparse data has received less attention and remains a challenging problem for Neural Networks.\nNevertheless, Neural Networks are able to discover nonlinear latent variables with heterogeneous data [13] which\nmakes them a promising tool for CF. [28, 30, 5] directly train Autoencoders to provide the best predicted ratings. Those methods report excellent results in the general case. However, the cold start initialization problem is ignored. For instance, AutoRec [28] replaces unpredictable ratings by an arbitrary selected score. In our case, we apply a training loss designed for sparse rating inputs and we integrate side information to lessen the cold start effect.\nOther contributions deal with this cold start problem by using Neural Networks properties for CBF: Neural Networks are first trained to learn a feature representation from the item which is then processed by a CF approach such as Probabilistic Matrix Factorization [23] to provide the final rating. For instance, [7, 36] respectively auto-encode bag-of-words from restaurant reviews and movie plots, [19] auto-encode heterogeneous side information from users and items. Finally, [34, 37] use Convolutional Networks on music samples. In our case, side information and ratings are used together without any unsupervised pretreatment."

      "heading" : "3.1 Sparse Inputs",
      "text" : "There is no standard approach for using sparse vectors as inputs of Neural Networks. Most of the papers dealing with sparse inputs get around by pre-computing an estimate of the missing values [32, 2]. In our case, we want the Autoencoder to handle this prediction issue by itself. Such problems have already been studied in industry [22] where 5% of the values are missing. However in Collaborative Filtering we often face datasets with more than 95% missing values. Furthermore, missing values are not known during training in Collaborative Filtering which makes the task even more difficult.\nOur approach includes three ingredients to handle the training of sparse Autoencoders:\n• inhibit the edges of the input layers by zeroing out values in the input,\n• inhibit the edges of the output layers by zeroing out back-propagated values,\n• use a denoising loss to emphasize rating prediction over rating reconstruction.\nOne way to inhibit the input edges is to turn missing values to zero. To keep the Autoencoder from always returning zero, we also use an empirical loss that disregards the loss of unknown values. No error is back-propagated for missing values. Therefore, the error is back-propagated for actual zero values while it is discarded for missing values. In other words, missing values do not bring information to the Network. This operation is equivalent to removing the neurons with missing values described in [27, 28]. However, Our method has important computational advantages because only one Neural Networks is trained whereas other techniques has to share the weights among thousands of Networks.\nFinally, we take advantage of the masking noise from the Denoising AutoEncoders (DAE) empirical loss. By simulating missing values in the training process, Autoencoders are trained to predict them. In Collaborative Filtering, this prediction aspect is actually the final target. Thus, emphasizing the prediction criterion turns the classic unsupervised training of Autoencoders into a simulated supervised learning. By mixing both the reconstruction and prediction criteria, the training can be thought as a pseudo-semi-supervised learning. This makes the DAE loss a promising objective function. After regularization, the final training loss is:\nLα,β(x, x̃) = α\n  ∑\nj∈K(x)∩C(x̃) [nn(x̃)j − xj ]\n2\n\n+\nβ\n  ∑\nj∈K(x)\\C(x̃) [nn(x̃)j − xj ]\n2\n\n+ λ‖W‖2F ,\nwhere K(x) are the indices of known values of x, W is the flatten vector of weights of the Network and λ is the regularization hyperparameter. This loss is optimized thanks to standard forward/backward process on mini-batches. Importantly, Autoencoders with sparse inputs differs from sparseAutoencoders [15] or Dropout regularization [29] in the sense that Sparse Autoencoders and Droupout inhibit the hidden neurons for regularization purpose. Every inputs/outputs are also known."

      "heading" : "3.2 Integrating Side Information",
      "text" : "From the time being U/V-CFN only relies on the feedback of users regarding a set of items. Lets now incorporate additional information about the users and the items. We will show that these information help in several ways: increase the prediction accuracy, speed up the training, increase the robustness of the model, etc. Last but not least, incorporating side information is a well-known approach to tackle the cold start problem: when very little information is available on a user/item, Collaborative Filtering will have difficulties to infer its ratings.\nInstead of only adding the side information to the first layer of the Autoencoder, we propose to inject that information to every layer inputs of the Network. As an example, the model of U-CFN becomes\nnn({ui, zi}) = σ(W ′ 2{σ(W ′ 1{ui, zi}+ b1), zi}+ b2),\nwhere zi ∈ R P is the vector of side informations, W′1 ∈ R k×(N+P ) and W′2 ∈ R N×(k+P ) are the weight matrices,\n{x, zi} represents the concatenation of both vectors x and zi, and biases b1 and b2 respectively belong to R\nN+P and R\nk+P . By injecting the side information in every layer, the dynamic Autoencoders representation is forced to integrate this new data. However, to avoid side information to overstep the dense rating representation, we enforce the following constraints. The dimension of the sparse input must be greater than the dimension of the Autoencoder bottleneck which must be greater than the dimension of the side information1. Therefore, we get:"

Side information for MovieLens-1M is the age, sex and gender of the user and the movie category (action, thriller etc.).

To the best of our knowledge, the best result published regarding MovieLens10M (without side information) are reported by [18] and [3] with a final RMSE of respectively 0.7682 and 0.7769. However, those two methods require to recompute the full matrix for every new ratings. CFN has the key advantage to provide similar performance while being able to refine its prediction on the fly for new ratings.

For instance, [9, 12] reports a global RMSE above 0.8 on MovieLens-10M.\nIn the experiments, V-CFN outperforms U-CFN.

      "text" : "At first sight, the use of side information has a limited impact on the RMSE. This statement has to be mitigated: as the repartition of known entries in the dataset is not uniform, the estimates are biased towards users and items with a lot of ratings. For theses users and movies, the dataset already contains a lot of information, thus having some extra information will have a marginal effect. Users and items with few ratings should benefit more from some side information but the estimation biais hides them.\nIn order to exhibit the utility of side information, we report in Table 2 the RMSE conditionally to the number of missing values for items. As expected, the fewer number of ratings for an item, the more important the side information. A more careful analysis of the RMSE improvement in this setting shows that the improvement is uniformly distributed over the users whatever their number of ratings. This corresponds to the fact that the available side information is only about items. This is very desirable for a real system: the\n4Hyperparameters used for the experiments are provided with the source code.\neffective use of side information to the new items is crucial to deal with the flow of new products.\nIn the end, we trained V-CFN on MovieLens-10M with either the movie genre or the matrix of tags. Both side information increase the global RMSE by 0.13% and concatenating them increase the final score by a small margin of 0.20%. Therefore, V-CFN could handle the heterogeneity of side information. However, the U-CFN failed to use the friendship relationship to increase the RMSE."

However, Collaborative Filtering deals with sparse data and GPUs are designed to perform well on dense data.

In our case, we tackle the issue by selectively densifying the inputs just before sending them to the GPUs cores without modification of the result of the computation. It introduces an overhead on the computational complexity but this implementation allows the GPUs to work at their full strength. In practice, vectorial operations overtake the extra cost. Such approach is an efficient strategy to handle sparse data which achieves a balance between memory footprint and computational time.\n5https://github.com/fstrub95/Autoencoders cf\nWe are able to train Large Neural Networks within a few minutes as shown in Table 3.

In the last decades, few attempts where done to handle that objective with Neural Networks, but recently an architecture based on Autoencoders proved to be a promising approach. In current paper, we enhanced that architecture (i) by using a loss function adapted to input data with missing values, and (ii) by incorporating side information. The experiments demonstrate that while side information only slightly improve the test error averaged on all users/items, it has more impact on cold users/items.",
