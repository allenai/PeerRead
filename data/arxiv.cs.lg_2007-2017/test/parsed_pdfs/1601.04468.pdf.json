      "text" : "Learning from bandit1 feedback describes an online learning scenario, where on each of a sequence of rounds, a learning algorithm makes a prediction, and receives partial information in terms of feedback to a single predicted point. In difference to the full information supervised scenario, the learner does not know what the correct prediction looks like, nor what would have happened if it had predicted differently. This scenario has (financially) important real world applications such as online advertising (Chapelle et al., 2014) that showcases a tradeoff between exploration (a new ad needs to be displayed in order to learn its click-through rate) and exploitation (displaying the ad with the current best estimate is better in the short term). Crucially, in this scenario it is unrealistic to expect more detailed feedback than a user click on the displayed ad. Similar to the online advertising scenario, there are many potential applications of bandit learning to NLP situations where feedback is limited for various reasons. For example, online learning has been applied successfully in interactive statistical machine translation (SMT) (Bertoldi et al., 2014; Denkowski et al., 2014; Green et al., 2014). Post-editing feedback clearly is limited by its high cost and by the required expertise of users, however, current approaches force the full information supervised scenario onto the problem of learning from user post-edits.\n1The name is inherited from a model where in each round a gambler pulls an arm of a different slot machine (“one-armed bandit”), with the goal of maximizing his reward relative to the maximal possible reward, without apriori knowledge of the optimal slot machine.\nBandit learning would allow to learn from partial user feedback that is easier and faster to obtain than full information. An example where user feedback is limited by a time constraint is simultaneous translation of a speech input stream (Cho et al., 2013). Clearly, it is unrealistic to expect user feedback that goes beyond a one-shot user quality estimate of the predicted translation in this scenario. Another example is SMT domain adaptation where the translations of a large out-of-domain model are re-ranked based on bandit feedback on in-domain data. This can also be seen as a simulation of personalized machine translation where a given large SMT system is adapted to a user solely by single-point user feedback to predicted structures.\nThe goal of this paper is to develop algorithms for structured prediction from bandit feedback, tailored to NLP problems. We investigate possibilities to “banditize” objectives such as expected loss (Och, 2003; Smith and Eisner, 2006; Gimpel and Smith, 2010) that have been proposed for structured prediction in NLP. Since most current approaches to bandit optimization rely on a multiclass classification scenario, the first challenge of our work is to adapt bandit learning to structured prediction over exponentially large structured output spaces (Taskar et al., 2004; Tsochantaridis et al., 2005). Furthermore, most theoretical work on online learning with bandit feedback relies on convexity assumptions about objective functions, both in the nonstochastic adversarial setting (Flaxman et al., 2005; Shalev-Shwartz, 2012) as well as in the stochastic optimization framework (Spall, 2003; Nemirovski et al., 2009; Bach and Moulines, 2011). Our case is a non-convex optimization problem, which we analyze in the simple and elegant framework of pseudogradient adaptation that allows us to show convergence of the presented algorithm (Polyak and Tsypkin, 1973; Polyak, 1987).\nThe central contributions of this paper are:\n• An algorithm for minimization of expected loss for structured prediction from bandit feedback, called Bandit Structured Prediction.\n• An analysis of convergence of our algorithm in the stochastic optimization framework of pseudogradient adaptation.\n• An experimental evaluation on structured learning in SMT. Our experiment follows a simulation design that is standard in bandit learning, namely by simulating bandit feedback by evaluating task loss functions against gold standard structures without revealing them to the learning algorithm.\nAs a disclaimer, we would like to note that improvements over traditional full-information structured prediction cannot be expected from learning from partial feedback. Instead, the goal is to investigate learning situations in which full information is not available. Similarly, a comparison between our approach and dueling bandits (Yue and Joachims, 2009) is skewed towards the latter approach that has access to two-point feedback instead of one-point feedback as in our case. While it has been shown that querying the loss function at two points leads to convergence results that closely resemble bounds for the full information case (Agarwal et al., 2010), such feedback is clearly twice as expensive and, depending on the application, might not be elicitable from users."

      "text" : "Stochastic Approximation. Online learning from bandit feedback dates back to Robbins (1952) who formulated the task as a problem of sequential decision making. His analysis, as ours, is in a stochastic setting, i.e., certain assumptions are made on the probability distribution of feedback and its noisy realization. Stochastic approximation covers bandit feedback as noisy observations which only allow to compute noisy gradients that equal true gradients\nin expectation. While the stochastic approximation framework is quite general, most theoretical analyses of convergence and convergence rate are based on (strong) convexity assumptions (Polyak and Juditsky, 1992; Spall, 2003; Nemirovski et al., 2009; Bach and Moulines, 2011, 2013) and thus not applicable to our case.\nNon-Stochastic Bandits. Auer et al. (2002) initiated an active area of research on nonstochastic bandit learning, i.e., no statistical assumptions are made on the distribution of feedback, including models of feedback as a malicious choice of an adaptive adversary. The adversarial bandit setting has been extended to take context or side information into account, using models based on general linear classifiers (Auer et al., 2002; Langford and Zhang, 2007; Chu et al., 2011). However, they formalize a multi-class classification problem that is not easily scalable to general exponentially large structured output spaces. Furthermore, most theoretical analyses rely on online (strongly) convex optimization (Flaxman et al., 2005; Shalev-Shwartz, 2012) thus limiting the applicability to our case.\nNeurodynamic Programming. Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis (1996) cover optimization for neural networks and reinforcement learning under the name of “neurodynamic programming”. Both areas are dealing with non-convex objectives that lead to stochastic iterative algorithms. Interestingly, the available analyses of non-convex optimization for neural networks and reinforcement learning in Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis (1996), Sutton et al. (2000), or Bottou (2004) rely heavily on Polyak and Tsypkin (1973)’s pseudogradient framework. We apply their simple and elegant framework directly to give asymptotic guarantees for our algorithm.\nNLP Applications. In the area of NLP, recently algorithms for response-based learning have been proposed to alleviate the supervision problem by extracting supervision signals from taskbased feedback to system predictions. For example, Goldwasser and Roth (2013) presented an online structured learning algorithm that uses positive executability of a semantic parse against a database to convert a predicted parse into a gold standard structure for learning. Riezler et al. (2014) apply a similar idea to SMT by using the executability of a semantic parse of a translated database query as signal to convert a predicted translation into gold standard reference in structured learning. Sokolov et al. (2015) present a coactive learning approach to structured learning in SMT where instead of a gold standard reference a slight improvement over the prediction is shown to be sufficient for learning. Saluja and Zhang (2014) present an incorporation of binary feedback into an latent structured SVM for discriminative SMT training. NLP applications based on reinforcement learning have been presented by Branavan et al. (2009) or Chang et al. (2015). Their model differs from ours in that it is structured as a sequence of states at which actions and rewards are computed, however, the theoretical foundation of both types of models can be traced back to Polyak and Tsypkin (1973)’s pseudogradient framework ."

      "text" : "The expected loss learning criterion for structured prediction is defined as a minimization of the expectation of a task loss function with respect to the conditional distribution over structured outputs (Gimpel and Smith, 2010; Yuille and He, 2012). More formally, let X be a structured input space, let Y(x) be the set of possible output structures for input x, and let ∆y : Y → [0, 1] quantify the loss ∆y(y′) suffered for making errors in predicting y′ instead of y; as a rule, ∆y(y\n′) = 0 iff y = y′. Then, for a data distribution p(x, y), the learning criterion is defined as minimization of the expected loss\nEp(x,y)pw(y′|x) [∆y(y ′)] =\n∑\nx,y\np(x, y) ∑\ny′∈Y(x)\n∆y(y ′)pw(y ′|x). (1)\nAssume further that output structures given inputs are distributed according to an underlying Gibbs distribution (a.k.a. conditional exponential or log-linear model)\npw(y|x) = exp(w⊤φ(x, y))/Zw(x),\nwhere φ : X × Y → Rd is a joint feature representation of inputs and outputs, w ∈ Rd is a weight vector, and Zw(w) is a normalization constant.\nThe natural rule for prediction or inference is according to the minimum Bayes risk principle\nŷw(x) = argmin y∈Y(x)\n∑\ny′∈Y(x)\n∆y(y ′)pw(y ′|x). (2)\nThis requires an evaluation of ∆y(y′) over the full output space, which is standardly avoided in practice by performing inference according to a maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion (which equals criterion (2) for the special case of ∆y(y′) = 1[y 6= y′] where 1[s] evaluates to 1 if statement s is true, 0 otherwise)\nŷw(x) = argmax y∈Y(x)\npw(y|x) (3)\n= argmax y∈Y(x)\nw⊤φ(x, y).\nFurthermore, since it is unfeasible to take expectations over the full space X × Y to perform minimization of objective (1), in the full information case the data distribution p(x, y) is approximated by the empirical distribution p̃(x, y) = 1\nT\n∑T\nt=0 1[x = xt]1[y = yt] for i.i.d. training data {(xt, yt)}Tt=0.

(4)\nWhile being continuous and differentiable, the expected loss criterion is typically nonconvex. For example, in SMT, expected loss training for the standard task loss BLEU leads to highly non-convex optimization problems. Despite of this, most approaches rely on gradientdescent techniques for optimization (see Och (2003), Smith and Eisner (2006), He and Deng (2012), Auli et al. (2014), Wuebker et al. (2015), inter alia) by following the opposite direction of the gradient of (4):\n∇Ep̃(x,y)pw(y′|x) [∆y(y′)]\n= Ep̃(x,y)\n[\nEpw(y′|x)[∆y(y ′)φ(x, y′)]− Epw(y′|x)[∆y(y′)] Epw(y′|x)[φ(x, y′)]\n]\n= Ep̃(x,y)pw(y′|x)\n[\n∆y(y ′)(φ(x, y′)− Epw(y′|x)[φ(x, y′)])\n]\n."

For each random i.i.d. input structure xt, we calculate the expected feature count (line 5). This can be done exactly, provided the underlying graphical model permits a tractable calculation, or for intractable models, with MCMC sampling. We then sample an output structure ỹt from the Gibbs model (line 6). If the number of output options is small, this is done by sampling from a multinomial distribution. Otherwise, we use a Perturb-and-MAP approach (Papandreou and Yuille, 2011), restricted to unary potentials, to obtain an approximate Gibbs sample without waiting for the MC chain to mix. Finally, an update in the negative direction of the instantaneous gradient, evaluated at the input structure xt (line 8), is performed.\nIntuitively, the algorithm compares the sampled feature vector to the average feature vector, and performs a step into the opposite direction of this difference, the more so the higher the loss of the sampled structure is.

Intuitively, the pseudogradient st is on average at an acute angle with the true gradient, meaning that −st is on average a direction of decrease of the functional J(w).\nIn order to show convergence of the iterative process (6), besides conditions (7) and (8), only mild conditions on boundedness of the pseudogradient\nE[‖st‖2] < ∞, (9) and on the use of a decreasing learning rate satisfying\nγt ≥ 0, ∞ ∑\nt=0\nγt = ∞, ∞ ∑\nt=0\nγ2t < ∞, (10)\nare necessary.

The convergence analysis of Theorem 1 can be applied to Algorithm 1 as follows: First note that we can define our functional J(w) with respect to expectations over the full space of X as J(w) = Ep(x)pw(y′|x)[∆(y\n′)]. This means, convergence of the algorithm can be understood directly as a generalization result that extends to unseen data. In order to show this result, we have to verify conditions (7)–(10).

The original algorithm is not specifically designed for structured prediction problems, but it is generic enough to be applicable to such problems when the quality of a parameter vector can be proxied through loss evaluation of an inferred structure.\nThe Structured Dueling Bandits algorithm compares a current weight vector wt with a neighboring point w′t along a direction ut, performing exploration (controlled by δ, line 5) by probing random directions, and exploitation (controlled by γ, line 8) by taking a step into the winning direction. The comparison step in line 6 is adapted to structured prediction from the original algorithm of Yue and Joachims (2009) by comparing the quality of wt and w′t via an evaluation of the losses ∆(ŷwt(xt)) and ∆(ŷw′t(xt)) of the structured arms corresponding to MAP prediction (3) under wt and w′t, respectively.\nFurther, note that the Structured Dueling Bandit algorithm requires access to a two-point feedback instead of a one-point feedback as in case of Bandit Structured Prediction (Algorithm 1). It has been shown that two-point feedback leads to convergence results that are close to those for learning from full information Agarwal et al. (2010). However, two-point feedback is twice as expensive as one-point feedback, and most importantly, such feedback might not be elicitable from users in real-world situations where feedback is limited by time- and resourceconstraints.

We compare the proposed Structured Bandit Prediction algorithm to Structured Dueling Bandits, and report results by test set evaluations of the respective loss functions under MAP inference. Furthermore, we evaluate models at different iterations according to their loss on the test set in order to visualize the empirical convergence behavior of the algorithms.\nAll experiments with bandit algorithms perform online learning for parameter estimation, and apply early stopping to choose the last model in a learning sequence for online-to-batch conversion at test time. Final results for bandit algorithms are averaged over 5 independent runs.\nIn this experiment, we present bandit learning for the structured 1 − BLEU loss used in SMT. The setup is a reranking approach to SMT domain adaptation where the k-best list of an out-of-domain model is re-ranked (without re-decoding) based on bandit feedback from in-\ndomain data. This can also be seen as a simulation of personalized machine translation where a given large SMT system is adapted to a user solely by single-point user feedback to predicted structures.\nWe use the data from the WMT 2007 shared task for domain adaptation experiments in a popular benchmark setup from Europarl to NewsCommentary for French-to-English (Koehn and Schroeder, 2007; Daumé and Jagarlamudi, 2011). We tokenized and lowercased our data using the moses toolkit, and prepared word alignments by fast align (Dyer et al., 2013). The SMT setup is phrase-based translation using non-unique 5,000-best lists from moses (Koehn et al., 2007) and a 4-gram language model (Heafield et al., 2013).\nThe out-of-domain baseline SMT model is trained on 1.6 million parallel Europarl data and includes the English side of Europarl and in-domain NewsCommentary in the language model. The model uses 15 dense features (6 lexicalized reordering features, 1 distortion, 1 outof-domain and 1 in-domain language model, 1 word penalty, 5 translation model features) that are tuned with MERT (Och, 2003) on a dev set of Europarl data (dev2006, 2,000 sentences). The full-information in-domain SMT model gives an upper bound by MERT tuning the out-ofdomain model on in-domain development data (nc-dev2007, 1,057 sentences). MERT runs for both baseline models were repeated 7 times and median results are reported.\nLearning under bandit feedback started at the learned weights of the out-of-domain median model. It uses the parallel NewsCommentary data (news-commentary, 43,194 sentences) to simulate bandit feedback, by evaluating the sampled translation against the gold standard reference using as loss function ∆ a smoothed per-sentence 1−BLEU (by flooring zero n-gram\ncounts to 0.01). The meta-parameters of Dueling Bandits and Bandit Structured Prediction were adjusted by online optimization of cumulative per-sentence 1−BLEU on a small in-domain dev set (nc-devtest2007, 1,064 parallel sentences). The final results are obtained by online-tobatch conversion where the model trained for 100 epochs on 43,194 in-domain training data is evaluated on a separate in-domain test set (nc-test2007, 2,007 sentences).\nTable 1 shows that the results for Bandit Structured Prediction and Dueling Bandits are very close, however, both are significant improvements over the out-of-domain SMT model that even includes an in-domain language model. We show the standard evaluation of the corpusBLEU metric evaluated under MAP inference. The range of possible improvements is given by the difference of the BLEU score of the in-domain model and the BLEU score of the out-ofdomain model – nearly 3 BLEU points. Bandit learning can improve the out-of-domain baseline by about 1.26 BLEU points (Bandit Structured Prediction) and by about 1.52 BLEU points (Dueling Bandits). All result differences are statistically significant at a p-value of 0.0001, using an Approximate Randomization test (Riezler and Maxwell, 2005; Clark et al., 2011). Figure 1 shows that per-sentence BLEU is a difficult metric to provide single-point feedback, yielding a non-smooth progression of loss values against iterations for Bandit Structured Prediction. The progression of loss values is smoother and empirical convergence speed is faster for Dueling Bandits since it can exploit preference judgements instead of having to trust real-valued feedback."

In such scenarios, per-sentence BLEU might not be the best metric to quantify feedback.

We present an application to discriminative reranking in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) where the learning algorithm only has access to a 1 − BLEU loss evaluation of a predicted translation instead of obtaining a gold standard reference translation. In our experiment bandit feedback is obtained by evaluating BLEU on reference translations without revealing them to the algorithm. This can be thought of as a simulation of interactive machine translation where an SMT system is personalized by a user who provides single point feedback to predicted translations. Our experiments show that our approach improves translation quality and is comparable to approaches that employ more informative feedback in learning.",
