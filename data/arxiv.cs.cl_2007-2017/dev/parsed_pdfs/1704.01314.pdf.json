      "text" : "Word segmentation and part-of-speech (POS) tagging are core steps for higher-level natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Given the raw text, segmentation is applied at the very first step and POS tagging is performed on top afterwards. As by convention the words in Chinese are not delimited by spaces, segmentation is non-trivial, but its accuracy has a significant impact on POS tagging. Moreover, POS tags provide useful information for word segmentation. Thus, modelling word segmentation and POS tagging jointly can outperform the pipeline models (Ng and Low, 2004; Zhang and Clark, 2008).\nPOS tagging is a typical sequence tagging problem over segmented words, while segmentation also can be modelled as a character-level tagging problem via predicting the labels that identify the word boundaries. Ng and Low (2004) propose a\njoint model which predicts the combinatory labels of segmentation boundaries and POS tags at the character level. Joint segmentation and POS tagging becomes a standard character-based sequence tagging problem and therefore the general machine learning algorithms for structured prediction can be applied.\nThe bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN) using conditional random fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) as the output interface for sentence-level optimisation (BiRNN-CRF) achieves state-of-the-art accuracies on various sequence tagging tasks (Huang et al., 2015; Ma and Hovy, 2016) and outperforms the traditional linear statistical models. RNNs with gated recurrent cells, such as long-short term memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) and gated recurrent units (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) are capable of capturing long dependencies and retrieving rich global information. The sequential CRF on top of the recurrent layers ensures that the optimal sequence of tags over the entire sentence is obtained.\nIn this paper, we model joint segmentation and POS tagging as a fully character-based sequence tagging problem via predicting the combinatory labels. The BiRNN-CRF architecture is adapted and applied. The Chinese characters are fed into the neural networks as vector representations. In addition to utilising the pre-trained character embeddings, we propose a concatenated ngram-representation of the characters. Furthermore, sub-character level information, namely radicals and orthographical features extracted by convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are also incorporated and tested. Three datasets of different sizes, genres and with different annotation schemes are employed for evaluation. Our model is thoroughly evaluated and compared with the joint segmentation and POS tagging model in ZPar\n(Zhang and Clark, 2010), which is a state-of-theart joint tagger using structured perceptron and beam decoding. According to the experimental results, our proposed model outperforms ZPar on all the datasets in terms of accuracy.\nThe main contributions of this work include: 1. We apply the BiRNN-CRF model for general sequence tagging to joint segmentation and POS tagging for Chinese and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. The experimental results show that our tagger is robust and accurate across datasets of different sizes, genres and annotation schemes. 2. We propose a novel approach for vector representations of characters that leads to substantial improvements over the baseline model. 3. Additional improvements are obtained via exploring the feasibility of utilising sub-character level information. 4. We provide an open-source implementation of our method along with pre-trained character embeddings.1"

The character representations will be described in detail in the following sections. For the recurrent layer, we employ GRU as the basic recurrent unit as it has similar functionalities but fewer parameters compared to LSTM (Chung et al., 2014). Dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) is applied to the outputs of the bidirectional recurrent layers. The outputs are concatenated and passed to the first-order chain CRF layer.

(2009a), the employed tags indicating the word boundaries are B, I, E, S representing a character at the beginning, inside, end of a word or as a singlecharacter word. The CRF layer models conditional scores over all possible combinatory labels given the input characters. Incorporating the transition scores between the successive labels, the op-\n1 https://github.com/yanshao9798/tagger\n(too) (hot)(summer)\ntimal sequence can be obtained efficiently via the Viterbi algorithm both for training and decoding.\nThe time complexity for the Viterbi algorithm is linear with respect to the sentence length n as O(k2n), where k is constant and equals to the total number of combinatory labels. The efficiency can be improved if we reduce k. For some POS tags, combining them with the full boundary tags is redundant. For instance, only the functional word 的 can be tagged as DEG in Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2005). Since it is a single-character word, combinatory tags of B-DEG, I-DEG, and E-DEG never occur in the experimental data and should therefore be pruned to reduce the search space. Similarly, if the maximum length of words under a given POS tag is two in the training data, we prune the corresponding label."

      "text" : "The prevalent character-based neural models assume that larger spans of text, such as words and\nn-grams, can be represented by the sequence of characters that they consist of. For example, the vector representation Vm,n of a span cm,n is obtained by passing the vector representations vi of the characters ci to a functions f as:\nVm,n = f(vm, vm+1, ..., vn) (1)\nwhere f is usually an RNN (Ling et al., 2015) or a CNN (dos Santos and Zadrozny, 2014).\nIn this paper, instead of completely relying on the BiRNN to extract contextual features from context-free character representations, we encode rich local information in the character vectors via employing the incrementally concatenated n-gram representation as demonstrated in Figure 2. In the example, the vector representation of the pivot character 太 in the given context is the concatenation of the context-free vector representation Vi,i of 太 itself along with Vi−1,i of the bigram 天太 as well as Vi−1,i+1 of the trigram 天太热.\nInstead of constructing the vector representation Vm,n of an n-gram cm,n from the character representations as in Equation 1, Vm,n in different orders, such as Vi,i, Vi−1,i, and Vi−1,i+1, are randomly initialised separately. We use a single special vector to represent all the unknown n-grams per order. The n-grams in different orders are then concatenated incrementally to form up the vector representations of a Chinese character in the given context, which is passed further to the recurrent layers. As shown in Figure 2, the neighbouring characters on both sides of the pivot character are taken into account."

      "text" : "Chinese characters are logograms. As opposed to alphabetical languages, there is rich information\nencrypted in the graphical components. For instance, the Chinese characters that share the same part 钅 (gold) are all somewhat related to metals, such as 银 (silver), 铁 (iron), 针 (needle) and so on. The shared part 钅 is known as the radical, which functions as a semantic indicator. Hence, we investigate the effectiveness of using the information below the character level for our task.\nRadicals are first represented as randomly initialised vectors and concatenated as parts of the character representations. Radicals are traditionally used as indices in Chinese dictionaries. In our approach, they are retrieved via the unicode representation of Chinese characters as the characters that share the same radical are grouped together. They are organised in consistent with the categorisation in Kangxi Dictionary (康熙字典), in which all the Chinese characters are grouped under 214 different radicals. We only employ the radicals of the common characters in the unicode range of (U+4E00, U+9FFF). For the characters out of the range and the non-Chinese characters, we use a single special vector as their radical representations.\nAdditionally, instead of presuming that only radicals encode sub-character level information, we use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract graphical features from scratch by regarding the Chinese characters as pictures and feed their pixels as the input. As illustrated in Figure 3, there are two convolutional layers, both followed by a max-pooling layer. The output of the second max-pooling layer is reshaped and passed to a regular fully-connected layer. Dropout is applied to the output of the fully-connected layer. The output is then concatenated as parts of the character representation. The CNNs are trained jointly with the main network."

The training time is proportional to both the size of the training set and the number of POS tags.\nTable 1 shows the adopted hyper-parameters. We use one set of parameters for all the experiments on different datasets. The weights of the\n2https://dumps.wikimedia.org/ 3http://www.sogou.com/labs/resource/cs.php\nneural networks, including the randomly intialised embeddings, are initialised using the scheme introduced in Glorot and Bengio (2010). The network is trained with the error back-propagation algorithm. All the embeddings are fine-tuned during training by back-propagating gradients. Adagrad (Duchi et al., 2011) with mini-batches is employed for optimisation with the initial learning rate η0 = 0.1, which is updated with a decay rate ρ = 0.05 as ηt = η0 ρ(t−1)+1 , where t is the index of the current epoch.\nThe model is optimised with respect to the performance on the development sets. F1-scores of both segmentation (F1Seg) and joint POS tagging (F1Seg&Tag) are employed as F1Seg ∗F1Seg&Tag to measure the performance of the model after each epoch during training. In our experiments, the models are trained for 30 epochs. To ensure that the weights are well optimised, we only adopt the best epoch after the model is trained at least for 5 epochs."

It is composed of newswire data. We follow the conventional split of the dataset as in Jiang et al. (2008); Kruengkrai et al. (2009a);\nZhang and Clark (2010). CTB9 consists of source texts in various genres, CTB5 is a subset of it. We split CTB9 by referring to the partition of CTB7 in Wang et al. (2011). We extend the training, development and test sets from CTB5 by adding 80% of the new data in CTB9 to training and 10% each to development and test. The doublechecked files are all placed in the test set. The detailed splitting information can be found in Table 10 in Appendix. UD Chinese has both universal and language-specific POS tags. They are not predicted jointly in this paper. For the sake of convenience, we refer the universal tags as UD1 and the language-specific ones as UD2 in the following sessions. To make the model benefit from the pre-trained character embeddings, we convert the texts in UD Chinese from traditional Chinese into simplified Chinese.\nTable 2 shows brief statistics of the employed datasets in numbers of words. The out-ofvocabulary (OOV) words are counted regardless of the POS tags. We can see that the size of UD Chinese is much smaller and it has a notably higher OOV rate than the two CTB datasets."

      "text" : "Table 3 shows the evaluation results of using concatenated n-grams up to different orders as the character representations. By introducing 2- grams, we can obtain vast improvements over solely using the conventional character embeddings, which indicates that not all the local information can be effectively captured by the BiRNN using context-free character representations. Utilising the concatenated n-grams ensures that the same character has different but yet closely related representations in different contexts, which is an effective way to encode contextual features.\nFrom the table, we see that notable improvements can be achieved further via employing 3- grams. 4-grams still help but only to CTB9 while adding 5-grams achieves almost no improvement on any of the datasets. The results imply that concatenating higher-order n-grams can be detrimental, especially on datasets in smaller sizes due to the fact that higher-order n-grams are more sparse in the training data and their vector representations cannot be trained well enough. Besides, adopting higher-order n-grams also substantially increases the numbers of weights and therefore both training and decoding become less efficient. Under the circumstances, we consider that 3-gram model is optimal for our task and it is employed in the following experiments for all the datasets.\nThe concatenated n-grams have a bigger size compared to the basic character representation. We conduct one additional experiment using a basic 1-gram character model with a larger character vector size of 300. The evaluation scores are similar to the basic character model with the size of 64, which shows that the improvements obtained by the n-gram model are not matched by enlarging the size of the vector representation.\nThe evaluation scores of the sub-character level features are reported in Table 4. The relevant features are added on top of the 3-gram model. Employing radicals and graphical features achieves similar improvements for segmentation while utilising radicals obtains better results for joint POS tagging on CTB5. However, radicals are not a very effective feature on CTB9, UD1 and UD2 whereas a notable enhancement is observed when employing graphical features on UD1. Using CNNs to extract graphical features is computationally much more expensive than simply adopting radicals via a lookup table, especially when GPU is not avail-\nable.\nFrom Table 5, we can learn that employing pretrained embeddings as initial vector representations for the characters achieves improvements in general, whereas the improvements are comparatively smaller if the the concatenated n-gram representations and the radicals are added. Additionally, the improvements obtained on UD Chinese are more significant than on CTBs, which indicates that the pre-trained character embeddings are more beneficial to the datasets in smaller sizes.\nIn general, the feature experiments indicate that the proposed Chinese character representations are all sensitive to dataset size. Using higher-order n-grams requires more data for training. On the other hand, the pre-trained embeddings are more vital if the dataset is small. In addition, the different representations are sensitive to tagging schemes as the evaluation results on UD1 and UD2 are quite diverse. Taking both robustness and efficiency into consideration, we select 3-grams along with radicals and pre-trained character embeddings as the best setting for final evaluation."

      "text" : "Table 6 shows the final scores on the test sets. The complete evaluation results in precision, re-\ncall and F1-scores are contained in Table 11 and Table 12 in Appendix. Our system is compared with ZPar. We retrained a ZPar model on CTB5 that reproduces the evaluation scores reported in Zhang and Clark (2010). We also modified the source code so that it is applicable to CTB9 and UD Chinese. In addition, we perform the mid-p McNemar’s test (Fagerland et al., 2013) to examine the statistical significances.\nAs shown in Table 6, the single model is worse than the ensemble model but still outperforms ZPar on all the tested datasets. ZPar incorporates discrete local features at both character and word levels and employs structured perceptron for global optimisation, whereas we encode rich local information in the character representations and employ BiRNN to effectively extract global features and capture long term dependencies. The chain CRF layer is used for sentencelevel optimisation, which functions similarly to structured perceptron. As opposed to the taggers built with traditional machine learning algorithms, our model avoids heavy feature engineering and benefits from large plain texts via utilising pre-trained character embeddings. It is also very flexible to add sub-character level features as parts of the character representations. The model\nperforms very well despite being fully character based. Moreover, it has clear advantages when applied to smaller datasets like UD Chinese, while the prevalence is much smaller on CTB5.\nBoth our model and ZPar segment OOV words in UD Chinese with higher accuracies than the ones in CTBs despite that UD Chinese is notably smaller and the overall OOV rate is higher. Compared to CTB, the words in UD Chinese are more fine-grained and the average word length is shorter, which makes it easier for the tagger to correctly segment the OOV words as Zhang et al. (2016) show that the longer words are more difficult to be segmented correctly. For joint POS tagging for OOV words, the two systems both perform significantly better on CTB5 as it is only composed of news text.\nIn general, our model is more robust to OOV words than ZPar, except that ZPar yields better result for segmentation by a small margin on CTB9. ZPar also obtains higher accuracy for joint POS tagging than the single model on CTB9. The differences between ZPar and our model for both segmentation and POS tagging are more substantial on UD Chinese, which indicates that our model is relatively more advantageous for handling OOV words when the training sets are small, whereas ZPar is able to perform equally well when substantial amount of training data is available as they achieve similar results on the CTB sets.\nThe single model is further improved by ensemble-averaging four independently trained models. The improvements are not drastic but they are observed systematically across all the datasets. In general, ensemble decoding is beneficial to handling OOV words as well except that a small drop for segmentation on CTB5 is observed.\nTable 7 displays the evaluation of the ensemble model and ZPar on the decomposed test sets\nof CTB9 in different genres. Our model surpasses ZPar on all the genres in both segmentation and joint POS tagging. The differences are subtle on the genres in which the texts are normalised, such as News and Broadcast News. This, to a very large extent, explains why our model is only marginally better than ZPar on CTB5, whereas the experimental results reveal that our model is substantially better at processing non-standard text as it yields significantly higher scores on Conversations, Short Messages and Weblogs. The evaluation results of both our model and ZPar vary substantially across different genres as some genres are fundamentally more challenging to process.\nOur models are compared with the previous best-performing systems on CTB5 in Table 8. Our models are not optimised particularly with respect to CTB5 but still yield competitive results, especially for joint POS tagging. We are the first to report evaluation scores on CTB9 and UD Chinese."

Concatenated n-grams as well as sub-character features are employed along with the conventional pre-trained character embeddings as the vector representations for Chinese characters. The feature experiments indicate that concatenated ngrams contribute substantially. However, both radicals and graphical features as sub-character level information are less effective. How to incorporate the sub-character level information more effectively will be further explored in the future.\nThe proposed model is extensively evaluated on CTB5, CTB9 and UD Chinese. Despite the fact that different character representation approaches are sensitive to data size and tagging schemes, we use one set of hyper-parameters and universal feature settings so that the model is robust across datasets. The experimental results on the test sets show that our model outperforms ZPar which is built on structured perceptron on all the datasets. We obtain state-of-the-art performances on CTB5.\nThe results on UD Chinese and CTB9 also reveal that our model has great advantages in processing non-standard text, such as weblogs, forum text and short messages. Moreover, the implemented tagger is very efficient with GPU devices and therefore can be applied to tagging very large files."
