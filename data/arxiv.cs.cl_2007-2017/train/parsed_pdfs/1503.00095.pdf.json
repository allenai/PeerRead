      "text" : "Automatic classification of semantic relations has a variety of applications, such as information extraction and the construction of semantic networks (Girju et al., 2007; Hendrickx et al., 2010). A traditional approach to relation classification is to train classifiers using various kinds of features with class labels annotated by humans. Carefully crafted features derived from lexical, syntactic, and semantic resources play a significant role in achieving high accuracy for semantic relation classification (Rink and Harabagiu, 2010).\nIn recent years there has been an increasing interest in using word embeddings as an alternative to traditional hand-crafted features. Word embeddings are represented as real-valued vectors and capture syntactic and semantic sim-\nilarity between words. For example, word2vec1 (Mikolov et al., 2013b) is a well-established tool for learning word embeddings. Although word2vec has successfully been used to learn word embeddings, these kinds of word embeddings capture only co-occurrence relationships between words (Levy and Goldberg, 2014). While simply adding word embeddings trained using window-based contexts as additional features to existing systems has proven valuable (Turian et al., 2010), more recent studies have focused on how to tune and enhance word embeddings for specific tasks (Bansal et al., 2014; Boros et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2014; Guo et al., 2014; Nguyen and Grishman, 2014) and we continue this line of research for the task of relation classification.\nIn this work we present a learning method for word embeddings specifically designed to be useful for relation classification. The overview of our system and the embedding learning process are shown in Figure 1. First we train word embeddings by predicting each of the words between noun pairs using lexical relation-specific features on a large unlabeled corpus. We then use the word embeddings to construct lexical feature vectors for relation classification. Lastly, the feature vectors are used to train a relation classification model.\nWe evaluate our method on a well-established semantic relation classification task and compare it to a baseline based on word2vec embeddings and previous state-of-the-art models that rely on either manually crafted features, syntactic parses or external semantic resources. Our method significantly outperforms the word2vec-based baseline, and compares favorably with previous state-\n1https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/.\nof-the-art models, despite relying only on lexical level features and no external annotated resources. Furthermore, our qualitative analysis of the learned embeddings shows that n-grams of our embeddings capture salient syntactic patterns similar to semantic relation types."

      "text" : "A traditional approach to relation classification is to train classifiers in a supervised fashion using a variety of features. These features include lexical bag-of-words features and features based on syntactic parse trees. For syntactic parse trees, the paths between the target entities on constituency and dependency trees have been demonstrated to be useful (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005; Zhang et al., 2006). On the shared task introduced by Hendrickx et al. (2010), Rink and Harabagiu (2010) achieved the best score using a variety of hand-crafted features which were then used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM).\nRecently, word embeddings have become popular as an alternative to hand-crafted features (Collobert et al., 2011). However, one of the limitations is that word embeddings are usually learned by predicting a target word in its context, leading to only local co-occurrence information being captured (Levy and Goldberg, 2014). Thus, several recent studies have focused on overcoming this limitation. Le and Mikolov (2014) integrated paragraph information into a word2vec-based model, which allowed them to capture paragraphlevel information. For dependency parsing, Bansal et al. (2014) and Chen et al. (2014) found\nways to improve performance by integrating dependency-based context information into their embeddings. Bansal et al. (2014) trained embeddings by defining parent and child nodes in dependency trees as contexts. Chen et al. (2014) introduced the concept of feature embeddings induced by parsing a large unannotated corpus and then learning embeddings for the manually crafted features. For information extraction, Boros et al. (2014) trained word embeddings relevant for event role extraction, and Nguyen and Grishman (2014) employed word embeddings for domain adaptation of relation extraction. Another kind of task-specific word embeddings was proposed by Tang et al. (2014), which used sentiment labels on tweets to adapt word embeddings for a sentiment analysis tasks. However, such an approach is only feasible when a large amount of labeled data is available."

      "text" : "We propose a novel method for learning word embeddings designed for relation classification. The word embeddings are trained by predicting each word between noun pairs, given the corresponding low-level features for relation classification. In general, to classify relations between pairs of nouns the most important features come from the pairs themselves and the words between and around the pairs (Hendrickx et al., 2010). For example, in the sentence in Figure 1 (b) there is a cause-effect relationship between the two nouns conflicts and players. To classify the relation, the most common features are the noun pair (conflicts,\nplayers), the words between the noun pair (are, caused, by), the words before the pair (the, external), and the words after the pair (playing, tiles, to, ...). As shown by Rink and Harabagiu (2010), the words between the noun pairs are the most effective among these features. Our main idea is to treat the most important features (the words between the noun pairs) as the targets to be predicted and other lexical features (noun pairs, words outside them) as their contexts. Due to this, we expect our embeddings to capture relevant features for relation classification better than previous models which only use window-based contexts.\nIn this section we first describe the learning process for the word embeddings, focusing on lexical features for relation classification (Figure 1 (b)). We then propose a simple and powerful technique to construct features which serve as input for a softmax classifier. The overview of our proposed system is shown in Figure 1 (a)."

      "text" : "Assume that there is a noun pair n = (n1, n2) in a sentence with Min words between the pair and Mout words before and after the pair:\n• win = (w in 1 , . . . , w in Min ) ,\n• wbef = (w bef 1 , . . . , w bef Mout ) , and\n• waft = (w aft 1 , . . . , w aft Mout ) .\nOur method predicts each target word wini ∈ win using three kinds of information: n, words around wini in win, and words in wbef and waft. Words are embedded in a d-dimensional vector space and we refer to these vectors as word embeddings. To discriminate between words in n from those in win, wbef , and waft, we have two sets of word embeddings: N ∈ Rd×|N | and W ∈ Rd×|W|. W is a set of words and N is also a set of words but contains only nouns. Hence, the word cause has two embeddings: one in N and another in W. In general cause is used as a noun and a verb, and thus we expect the noun embeddings to capture the meanings focusing on their noun usage. This is inspired by some recent work on word representations that explicitly assigns an independent representation for each word usage according to its partof-speech tag (Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010; Grefenstette and Sadrzadeh, 2011;\nHashimoto et al., 2013; Hashimoto et al., 2014; Kartsaklis and Sadrzadeh, 2013).\nA feature vector f ∈ R2d(2+c)×1 is constructed to predict wini by concatenating word embeddings:\nf = [N(n1);N(n2);W(w in i−1); . . . ;W(w in i−c);\nW(wini+1); . . . ;W(w in i+c);\n1\nMout\nMout ∑\nj=1\nW(wbefj ); 1\nMout\nMout ∑\nj=1\nW(waftj )] .\n(1)\nN(·) and W(·) ∈ Rd×1 corresponds to each word and c is the context size. A special NULL token is used if i− j is smaller than 1 or i+ j is larger than Min for each j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , c}.\nOur method then estimates a conditional probability p(w|f) that the target word is a word w given the feature vector f , using a logistic regression model:\np(w|f) = σ(W̃(w) · f + b(w)) , (2)\nwhere W̃(w) ∈ R2d(2+c)×1 is a weight vector for w, b(w) ∈ R is a bias for w, and σ(x) = 1\n1+e−x\nis the logistic function. Each column vector in W̃ ∈ R2d(c+1)×|W| corresponds to a word. That is, we assign a logistic regression model for each word, and we can train the embeddings using the one-versus-rest approach to make p(wini |f) larger than p(w′|f) for w′ 6= wini . However, naively optimizing the parameters of those logistic regression models would lead to prohibitive computational cost since it grows linearly with the size of the vocabulary.\nWhen training we employ several procedures introduced by Mikolov et al. (2013b), namely, negative sampling, a modified unigram noise distribution and subsampling. For negative sampling the model parameters N, W, W̃, and b are learned by maximizing the objective function Junlabeled:\n∑\nn\nMin ∑\ni=1\n log(p(wini |f)) + k ∑\nj=1\nlog(1− p(w′j|f))\n\n ,\n(3) where w′j is a word randomly drawn from the unigram noise distribution weighted by an exponent of 0.75. Maximizing Junlabeled means that our method can discriminate between each target word and k noise words given the target word’s context. This approach is much less computationally expensive than the one-versus-rest approach and has proven effective in learning word embeddings.\nTo reduce redundancy during training we use subsampling. A training sample, whose target word is w, is discarded with the probability Pd(w) = 1− √ t p(w) , where t is a threshold which is set to 10−5 and p(w) is a probability corresponding to the frequency of w in the training corpus. The more frequent a target word is, the more likely it is to be discarded. To further emphasize infrequent words, we apply the subsampling approach not only to target words, but also to noun pairs; concretely, by drawing two random numbers r1 and r2, a training sample whose noun pair is (n1, n2) is discarded if Pd(n1) is larger than r1 or Pd(n2) is larger than r2.\nSince the feature vector f is constructed as defined in Eq. (1), at each training step, W̃(w) is updated based on information about what pair of nouns surrounds w, what word n-grams appear in a small window around w, and what words appear outside the noun pair. Hence, the weight vector W̃(w) captures rich information regarding the target word w."

      "text" : "Once the word embeddings are trained, we can use them for relation classification. Given a noun pair n = (n1, n2) with its context words win, wbef , and waft, we construct a feature vector to classify the relation between n1 and n2 by concatenating three kinds of feature vectors:\ngn the word embeddings of the noun pair,\ngin the averaged n-gram embeddings between the pair, and\ngout the concatenation of the averaged word embeddings in wbef and waft.\nThe feature vector gn ∈ R2d×1 is the concatenation of N(n1) and N(n2):\ngn = [N(n1);N(n2)] . (4)\nWords between the noun pair contribute to classifying the relation, and one of the most common ways to incorporate an arbitrary number of words is treating them as a bag of words. However, word order information is lost for bag-of-words features such as averaged word embeddings. To incorporate the word order information, we first define ngram embeddings hi ∈ R4d(1+c)×1 between the\nnoun pair:\nhi = [W(w in i−1); . . . ;W(w in i−c);\nW(wini+1); . . . ;W(w in i+c);W̃(w in i )] .\n(5)\nNote that W̃ can also be used and that the value used for n is (2c+1). As described in Section 3.1, W̃ captures meaningful information about each word and after the first embedding learning step we can treat the embeddings in W̃ as features for the words. Mnih and Kavukcuoglu (2013) have demonstrated that using embeddings like those in W̃ is useful in representing the words. We then compute the feature vector gin by averaging hi:\ngin = 1\nMin\nMin ∑\ni=1\nhi . (6)\nWe use the averaging approach since Min depends on each instance. The feature vector gin allows us to represent word sequences of arbitrary lengths as fixed-length feature vectors using the simple operations: concatenation and averaging.\nThe words before and after the noun pair are sometimes important in classifying the relation. For example, in the phrase “pour n1 into n2”, the word pour should be helpful in classifying the relation. As with Eq. (1), we use the concatenation of the averaged word embeddings of words before and after the noun pair to compute the feature vector gout ∈ R2d×1:\ngout = 1\nMout [\nMout ∑\nj=1\nW(wbefj );\nMout ∑\nj=1\nW(waftj )] .\n(7) As described above, the overall feature vector e ∈ R4d(2+c)×1 is constructed by concatenating gn, gin, and gout. We would like to emphasize that we only use simple operations: averaging and concatenating the learned word embeddings. The feature vector e is then used as input for a softmax classifier, without any complex transformation such as matrix multiplication with non-linear functions."

We have found that dropout (Hinton et al., 2012) is helpful in preventing our model from overfitting. Concretely, elements in e are randomly omitted with a probability of 0.5 at each training step. Recently dropout has been applied to deep neural network models for natural language processing tasks and proven effective (Irsoy and Cardie, 2014; Paulus et al., 2014).\nIn what follows, we refer to the above method as RelEmb. While RelEmb uses only low-level features, a variety of useful features have been proposed for relation classification. Among them, we use dependency path features (Bunescu and Mooney, 2005) based on the untyped binary dependencies of the Stanford parser to find the shortest path between target nouns. The dependency path features are computed by averaging word embeddings from W on the shortest path, and are then concatenated to the feature vector e. Furthermore, we directly incorporate semantic information using word-level semantic features from Named Entity (NE) tags and WordNet hypernyms, as used in previous work (Rink and Harabagiu, 2010; Socher et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2014). We refer to this extended method as RelEmbFULL. Concretely, RelEmbFULL uses the same binary features as in Socher et al. (2012). The features come from NE tags and WordNet hypernym tags of target nouns provided by a sense tagger (Ciaramita and Altun, 2006)."

The performance of the nounspecific embeddings is roughly the same as that of the word2vec embeddings."

      "text" : "Using the n-gram embeddings hi in Eq. (5), we inspect which n-grams are relevant to each relation class after the supervised learning step of RelEmb. When the context size c is 3, we can use at most 7-grams. The learned weight matrix S in Section 3.3 is used to detect the most relevant n-grams for each class. More specifically, for each n-gram embedding (n = 1, 3) in the training set, we compute the dot product between the n-gram embedding and the corresponding components in S. We then select the pairs of n-grams and class labels with the highest scores. In Table 6 we show the top five n-grams for six classes. These results clearly show that the n-gram embeddings capture salient syntactic patterns which are useful for the relation classification task."

      "text" : "We have presented a method for learning word embeddings specifically designed for relation classification. The word embeddings are trained using large unlabeled corpora to capture lexical features for relation classification. On a well-established semantic relation classification task our method significantly outperforms the baseline based on word2vec. Our method also compares favorably to previous state-of-the-art models that rely on syntactic parsers and external semantic resources, despite our method requiring only access to an unannotated corpus and a POS tagger. For future work, we will investigate how well our method performs on other domains and datasets and how relation labels can help when learning embeddings in a semisupervised learning setting."

Our word embeddings are trained by predicting words between noun pairs using lexical relation-specific features on a large unlabeled corpus. This allows us to explicitly incorporate relationspecific information into the word embeddings. The learned word embeddings are then used to construct feature vectors for a relation classification model. On a wellestablished semantic relation classification task, our method significantly outperforms a baseline based on a previously introduced word embedding method, and compares favorably to previous state-of-the-art models that use syntactic information or manually constructed external resources.",
