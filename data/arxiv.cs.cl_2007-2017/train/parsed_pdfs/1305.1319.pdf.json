      "text" : "The task of extractive summarization is to select a subset of sentences from a source document to present as a summary. Supervised approaches to this problem make use of training data in the form of source documents paired with existing summaries (Marcu, 1999; Osborne, 2002; Jing and McKeown, 1999; Ceylan and Mihalcea, 2009). These methods learn what features of a source sentence are likely to result in that sentence appearing in the summary; for news articles, for example, strong predictive features include the position of a sentence in a document (earlier is better), the sentence length (shorter is better), and the number of words in a sentence that are among the most frequent in the document.\nSupervised discriminative summarization relies on an alignment between a source document and\nits summary. For short texts and training pairs where a one-to-one alignment between source and abstract sentences can be expected, standard techniques from machine translation can be applied, including word-level alignment (Brown et al., 1990; Vogel et al., 1996; Och and Ney, 2003) and longer phrasal alignment (Daumé and Marcu, 2005), especially as adapted to the monolingual setting (Quirk et al., 2004). For longer texts where inference over all possible word alignments becomes intractable, effective approximations can be made, such as restricting the space of the available target alignments to only those that match the identity of the source word (Jing and McKeown, 1999).\nThe use of alignment techniques for book summarization, however, challenges some of these assumptions. The first is the disparity between the length of the source document and that of a summary. While the ratio between abstracts and source documents in the benchmark Ziff-Davis corpus of newswire (Marcu, 1999) is approximately 12% (133 words vs. 1,066 words), the length of a full-text book greatly overshadows the length of a simple summary. Figure 1 illustrates this with a dataset comprised of books from Project Gutenberg paired with plot summaries extracted from Wikipedia for a set of 439 books (described more fully in §4.1 below). The average ratio between a summary and its corresponding book is 1.2%.\nThis disparity in size leads to a potential violation of a second assumption: that we expect words and phrases in the source document to align with words and phrases in the target. When the disparity is so great, we might rather expect that an entire paragraph, page, or even chapter in a book aligns to a single summary sentence.\nar X\niv :1\n30 5.\n13 19\nv1 [\ncs .C\nL ]\n6 M\nay 2\n01 3\nTo help adapt existing methods of supervised document summarization to books, we present two alignment techniques that are specifically adapted to the problem of book alignment, one that aligns passages of varying size in the source document to sentences in the summary, guided by the unigram language model probability of the sentence under that passage; and one that generalizes the HMM alignment model of Och and Ney (2003) to the case of long but sparsely aligned documents."

      "text" : "This work builds on a long history of unsupervised word and phrase alignment originating in the machine translation literature, both for the task of learning alignments across parallel text (Brown et al., 1990; Vogel et al., 1996; Och and Ney, 2003; DeNero et al., 2008) and between monolingual (Quirk et al., 2004) and comparable corpora (Barzilay and Elhadad, 2003). For the related task of document/abstract alignment, we draw on work in document summarization (Marcu, 1999; Osborne, 2002; Daumé and Marcu, 2005). Past approaches to fictional summarization, including both short stories (Kazantseva and Szpakowicz, 2010) and books (Mihalcea and Ceylan, 2007), have tended toward nondiscriminative methods; one notable exception is Ceylan (2011), which applies the Viterbi alignment\nmethod of Jing and McKeown (1999) to a set of 31 literary novels."

      "text" : "We present two methods, both of which involve estimating the parameters of a hidden Markov model (HMM). The HMMs differ in their definitions of states, observations, and parameterizations of the emission distributions. We present a generic HMM first, then instantiate it with each of our two models, discussing their respective inference and learning algorithms in turn.\nLet S be the set of hidden states andK = |S|. An observation sequence t = 〈t1, . . . , tn〉, each t` ∈ V , is assigned probability:\np(t | n) = ∑ z∈Sn πz1\n( n∏\n`=1\nηz`,t`γz`,z`+1\n) (1)\nwhere z is the sequence of hidden states, π ∈ ∆K is the distribution over start states, and for all s ∈ S, ηs ∈ ∆|V| and γs ∈ ∆K are s’s emission and transition distributions, respectively. Note that we avoid stopping probabilities by always conditioning on the sequence length."
    }, {
      "heading" : "3.1 Passage Model",
      "text" : "In the passage model, each HMM state corresponds to a contiguous passage in the source document. The intuition behind this approach is the following: while word and phrasal alignment attempts to capture fine-grained correspondences between a source and target document, longer documents that are distilled into comparatively short summaries may instead have long, topically coherent passages that are summarized into a single sentence. For example, the following summary sentence in a Wikipedia plot synopsis summarizes several long episodic passages in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer:\nAfter playing hooky from school on Friday and dirtying his clothes in a fight, Tom is made to whitewash the fence as punishment all of the next day.\nOur aim is to find the sequence of passages in the source document that aligns to the sequence of summary sentences. Therefore, we identify each HMM\nstate in s ∈ S with source document positions is and js. When a summary sentence t` = 〈t`,1, . . . , t`,T`〉 is sampled from state s, its emission probability is defined as follows:\nηs,t` = T∏̀ k=1 p̂unigram(t`,k | bis:js) (2)\nwhere bis:js is the passage in the source document from position is to position js; again, we avoid a stop symbol by implicitly assuming lengths are fixed exogenously. The unigram distribution p̂unigram(· | bis:js) is estimated directly from the source document passage bis:js .\nThe transition distribution from state s ∈ S, γs is operationalized following the HMM word alignment formulation of Vogel et al. (1996). The transition events between ordered pairs of states are binned by the difference in two passages’ ranks within the source document.1 We give the formula for relative frequency estimation of the transition distributions:\nγs,s′ = c(s′ − s)∑\ns′′∈S c(s− s′′) (3)\nwhere c(·) denotes the count of jumps of a particular length, measured as the distance between the rank order of two passages within a document; the count of a jump between passage 10 and passage 13 is the same as that between passage 21 and 24; namely, c(3). Note that this distance is signed, so that the distance of a backwards jump from passage 13 to passage 10 (−3) is not the same as a jump from 10 to 13 (3).\nThe HMM states’ spans are constrained not to overlap with each other, and they need not cover the source document. Because we do not know\n1These ranks are fixed; our inference procedure does not allow passages to overlap or to “leapfrog” over each other across iterations.\nthe boundary positions for states in advance, we must estimate them alongside the traditional HMM parameters. Figure 2 illustrates this scenario with a sequence of 17 words in the source document ([1 . . . 17]) and 4 sentences in the target summary ({a, b, c, d}). In this case, the states correspond to [1 . . . 4], [9 . . . 13], and [15 . . . 17]."

      "heading" : "3.1.1 Inference",
      "text" : "Given a source document b and a target summary t, our aim is to infer the most likely passage z` for each sentence t`. This depends on the parameters (π, η, and γ) and the passages associated with each state, so we estimate those as well, seeking to maximize likelihood. Our approach is an EM-like algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977); after initialization, it iterates among three steps:\n• E-step. Calculate p(t) and the posterior distributions q(zk | t) for each sentence tk. This is done using the forward-backward algorithm.\n• M-step. Estimate π and γ from the posteriors, using the usual HMM M-step.\n• S-step. Sample new passages for each state. The sampling distribution considers, for each state s, moving is subject to the no-overlapping constraint and js, and then moving js subject to the no-overlapping constraint and is (DeNero et al., 2008). (See §3.1.2 for more details.) The emission distribution ηs is updated whenever is and js change, through Equation 2.\nFor the experiments described in section 4, each source document is initially divided into K equallength passages (K = 100), from which initial emission probabilities are defined; π and γ are both initialized to uniform distribution. Boundary samples are collected once for each iteration, after one E step and one M step, for a total of 500 iterations."

      "heading" : "3.1.2 Sampling chunk boundaries",
      "text" : "During the S-step, we sample the boundaries of each HMM state’s passage, favoring (stochastically) those boundaries that make the observations more likely. We expect that, early on, most chunks will be radically reduced to smaller spans that match closely the target sentences aligned to them with high probability. Over subsequent iterations, longer spans should be favored when adding words at a boundary offsets the cost of adding the non-essential words between the old and new boundary.\nA greedy step—analogous to the M-step use to estimate parameters—is one way to do this: we could, on each S-step, move each span’s boundaries to the positions that maximize likelihood under the revised language model. Good local choices, however, may lead to suboptimal global results, so we turn instead to sampling. Note that, if our model defined a marginal distribution over passage boundary positions in the source document, this sampling step could be interpreted as part of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo EM algorithm (Wei and Tanner, 1990). As it is, we do not have such a distribution; this equates to a fixed uniform distribution over all valid (non-overlapping) passage boundaries.\nThe implication is that the probability of a particular state s’s passage’s start- or end-position is proportional to the probability of the observations generated given that span. Following any E-step, the assignment of observations to swill be fractional. This means that the likelihood, as a function of particular values of is and js, depends on all of the sentences\nin the summary:\nL(is, js) = n∏ `=1 η q(z`=s|t) s,t`\n(4)\n= n∏\n`=1 ( T∏̀ k=1 p̂unigram(t`,k | bis:js) )q(z`=s|t)\nFor example, in Figure 2, the start position of the second span (word 9) might move anywhere from word 5 (just past the end of the previous span) to word 12 (just before the end of its own span, js = 12). Each of the values should be sampled with probability proportional to Equation 4, so that the sampling distribution is:\n1∑12 i=5 L(i, 12) 〈L(5, 12), L(6, 12), . . . , L(12, 12)〉\nCalculating L for different boundaries requires recalculating the emission probabilities ηs,t` as the language model changes. We can do this efficiently (in linear time) by decomposing the language model probability. Here we represent a state s by its boundary positions in the source document, i : j, and we use the relative frequency estimate for p̂unigram .\nlog ηi:j,t` = T∑̀ k=1 log freq(t`,k; bi:j) j − i+ 1 (5)\n= −T` log(j − i+ 1) + T∑̀ k=1 log freq(t`,k; bi:j)\n(6)\nNow consider the change if we remove the first word from s’s passage, so that its boundaries are [i+1, j].\nLet bi denote the source document’s word at position i. log ηi+1:j,t` =\n−T` log(j − i) + T∑̀ k=1 log freq(t`,k; bi+1:j)\n= log ηi:j,t` + freq(bi; t`) log freq(bi; bi:j)− 1 freq(bi; bi:j)\n+ T` log j − i+ 1 j − i\n(7)\nThis recurrence is easy to solve for all possible left boundaries (respecting the no-overlap constraints) if we keep track of the word frequencies in each span of the source document—something we must do anyway to calculate p̂unigram . A similar recurrence holds for the right boundary of a passage.\nFigure 3 illustrates the result of this sampling procedure on the start and end positions for a single source passage in Heart of Darkness. After 500 iterations, the samples can be seen to fluctuate over a span of approximately 600 words; however, the modes are relatively peaked, with the most likely start position at 1613, and the most likely end position at 1660 (yielding a span of 47 words)."

      "heading" : "3.2 Token Model",
      "text" : "Jing and McKeown (1999) introduced an HMM whose states correspond to tokens in the source doc-\nument. The observation is the sequence of target summary tokens (restricting to those types found in the source document). The emission probabilities are fixed to be one if the source and target words match, zero if they do not. Hence each instance of v ∈ V in the target summary is assumed to be aligned to an instance of v in the source. The transition parameters were fixed manually to simulate a ranked set of transition types (e.g., transitions within the same sentence are more likely than transitions between sentences). No parameter estimation is used; the Viterbi algorithm is used to find the most probable alignment. The allowable transition space is bounded by F 2, where F is the frequency of the most common token in the source document. The resulting model is scalable to large source documents (Ceylan and Mihalcea, 2009; Ceylan, 2011).\nOne potential issue with this model is that it lacks the concept of a null source, not articulated in the original HMM alignment model of Vogel et al. (1996) but added by Och and Ney (2003). Without such a null source, every word in the summary must be generated by some word in the source document. The consequence of this decision is that a Viterbi alignment over the summary must pick a perhaps distant, low-probability word in the source document if no closer word is available. Additionally, while the choice to enforce lexical identity constrains the state space, it also limits the range of lexical variation captured.\nOur second model extends Jing’s approach in three ways.\nFirst, we introduce parameter inference to learn the values of start probabilities and transitions that maximize the likelihood of the data, using the EM algorithm. We operationalize the transition probabilities again following Vogel et al. (1996), but constrain the state space by only measuring transititions between fixed bucket lengths, rather than between the absolute position of each source word. The relative frequency estimator for transitions is:\nγs,s′ = c(b(s′ − s))∑\ns′′∈S c(b(s ′′ − s))\n(8)\nAs above, c(·) denotes the count of an event, and here b(·) is a function that transforms the difference between two token positions into a coarser set of bins (for example, b may transform a distance of 0\ninto its own bin, a distance of +1 into a different bin, a distance in the range [+2,+10] into a third bin, a difference of [−10,−2] into a fourth, etc.). Future work may include dynamically learning optimizal bin sizes, much as boundaries are learned in the passage HMM.\nSecond, we introduce the concept of a null source that can generate words in the target sentence. In the sentence-to-sentence translation setting, for a source sentence that is m words long, Och and Ney (2003) add m corresponding NULL tokens, one for each source word position, to be able to adequately model transitions to, from and between NULL tokens in an alignment. For a source document that is ca. 100,000 words long, this is clearly infeasible (since the complexity of even a single round of forward-backward inference is O(m2n), where n is the number of words in the target summary t). However, we can solve this problem by noting that the transition probability as defined above is not measured between individual words, but rather between the positions of coarser-grained chunks that contain each word; by coarsing the transitions to model the jump between a fixed set ofB bins (whereB m), we effectively only need to add B null tokens, making inference tractable. As a final restriction, we disallow transitions between source state positions i and j where |i− j| > τ . In the experiments described in section 4, τ = 1000.\nThird, we expand the emission probabilities to allow the translation of a source word into a fixed set of synonyms (e.g., as derived from Roget’s Thesaurus.2) This expands the coverage of important lexical variants while still constraining the allowable emission space to a reasonable size. All synonyms of a word are available as potential “translations”; the exact translation probability (e.g., ηpurchase,buy) is learned during inference."

All experiments described below use 10-fold cross validation, in which we partition the data into ten disjoint sets, train on nine of them and then test on the remaining held-out partition. Ten evaluations are conducted in total, with the reported accuracy being the average across all ten sets. First, all source books and paired summaries in the training set are aligned using one of the three unsupervised methods described above (Passage HMM, Token HMM, Jing 1999).\nNext, all of the sentences in the source side of the book/summary pairs are featurized; all sentences that have been aligned to a sentence in the summary are assiged a label of 1 (appearing in summary) and 0 otherwise (not appearing in summary). Using this featurized representation, we then train a binary logistic regression classifier with `2 regularization on the training data to learn which features are the most\n3http://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/ 4http://www.gutenberg.org\nindicative of a source sentence appearing in a summary. Following previous work, we devise sentencelevel features that can be readily computed in comparison both with the document in which the sentence in found, and in comparison with the collection of documents as whole (Yeh et al., 2005; Shen et al., 2007). All feature values are binary:\n• Sentence position within document, discretized into membership in each of ten deciles. (10 features.)\n• Sentence contains a salient name. We operationalize “salient name” as the 100 capitalized words in a document with the highest TF-IDF score in comparison with the rest of the data; only non-sentence-initial tokens are used for calculate counts. (100 features.)\n• Contains lexical item x (x ∈ most frequent 10,000 words). This captures the tendency for some actions, such as kills, dies to be more likely to appear in a summary. (10,000 features.)\n• Contains the first mention of lexical item x (x ∈most frequent 10,000 words). (10,000 features.)\n• Contains a word that is among the top [1,10], [1,100], [1,1000] words having the highest TF/IDF scores for that book. (3 features.)\nWith a trained model and learned weights for all features, we next featurize each sentence in a test book according to the same set of features described above and predict whether or not it will appear in the summary. Sentences are then ranked by probability and the top sentences are chosen to create a summary of 1,000 words. To create a summary, sentences are then ordered according to their position in the source document."

To evaluate the automatically generated summary, we calculate the ROUGE\nscore between the generated summary and the heldout reference summary from Wikipedia for each book. We consider both ROUGE-1, which measures the overlap of unigrams, and ROUGE-2, which measures bigram overlap. For the case of a single reference translation, ROUGE-N is calculated as the following (where w ranges over all unigrams or bigrams in the reference summary, depending on N , and c(·) is the count of the n-gram in the text).\n∑ w∈ref min(c(wref ), c(whyp))∑\nw∈ref c(wref ) (9)\nFigure 2 lists the results of a 10-fold test on the 439 available book/summary pairs. Both alignment models described above show a moderate improvement over the method of Jing et al. For comparison, we also present a baseline of simply choosing the first 1,000 words in the book as the summary.\nHow well does this method actually work in practice, however, at the task of generating summaries? Manually inspecting the generated summaries reveals that automatic summarization of books still has great room for improvement, for all alignment methods involved. Appendix A shows the sentences extracted as a summary for Heart of Darkness.\nIndependent of the quality of the generated summaries on held-out test data, one practical benefit of training binary log-linear models is that the resulting feature weights are interpretable, providing a datadriven glimpse into the qualities of a sentence that make it conducive to appearing in human-created summary. Table 3 lists the 25 strongest features predicting inclusion in the summary (rank-averaged over all ten training splits). The presence of a name in a sentence is highly predictive, as is its position at the beginning of a book (decile 0) or at the very end (decile 8 and 9). The strongest lexical features illustrate the importance of a character’s persona, particularly in their relation with others (father, son,\netc.), as well as the natural importance of major life events (death). The importance of these features in the generated summary of Heart of Darkness is clear – nearly every sentence contains one name, and the most important plot point captured is indeed one such life event (“Mistah Kurtz – he dead.”)."

Without such a null source, every word in the summary must be generated by some word in the source document. The consequence of this decision is that a Viterbi alignment over the summary must pick a perhaps distant, low-probability word in the source document if no closer word is available. Additionally, while the choice to enforce lexical identity constrains the state space, it also limits the range of lexical variation captured. Our second model extends Jing’s approach in three ways. First, we introduce parameter inference to learn the values of start probabilities and transitions that maximize the likelihood of the data, using the EM algorithm. We operationalize the transition probabilities again following Vogel et al. (1996), but constrain the state space by only measuring transititions between fixed bucket lengths, rather than between the absolute position of each source word.",
