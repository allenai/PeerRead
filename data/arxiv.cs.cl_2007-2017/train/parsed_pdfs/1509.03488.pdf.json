      "text" : "Verbs that are able to take clausal and non-finite arguments add a further meaning component to their embedded argument. For example, there are verbs that mark the embedded argument as non-factual as in (1), realized as non-finite construction, and as factual in (2), realized as that-clause:\n(1) He pretends to take notes on his laptop, but really is updating his Facebook profile.\n(2) He later realized that his computer had been infected with spyware.\nWe use the term “abstract object” (AO) introduced by (Asher, 1993) to refer to the entities expressed\nby embedded clausal and non-finite arguments of AO selecting verbs.\nSuch verbs convey additional information about the AOs, in particular, their degree of factuality. They play an important role not only for the automatic discrimination of factual and non-factual content in text, but also for a more fine-grained characterization of non-factual content capturing semantic aspects such as beliefs, plans and intentions, or completely hypothetical content. Hence, classifications of AO selecting verbs according to semantic criteria are important knowledge sources for many semantic NLP tasks where a discrimination of factual and non-factual content is required, ranging from commited belief tagging (Prabhakaran et al., 2010) and determining the degree of factuality of a given text (Saurı́ and Pustejovsky, 2012; de Marneffe et al., 2012) to textual entailment (Saurı́ and Pustejovsky, 2007; Lotan et al., 2013). Various semantic classifications of AO selecting verbs have been developed, e.g., (Kiparsky and Kiparsky, 1970; Karttunen, 1971; Karttunen, 2012), some of them explicitly in the context of NLP (Nairn et al., 2006; Saurı́, 2008).\nHowever, semantic classifications of verbs are notoriously hard to evaluate. Typically, these classifications are constructed manually without being evaluated regarding the replicability of the classification task. Inter-annotator agreement for the classification task has not been reported for many classifications of AO selecting verbs used in NLP (Kiparsky and Kiparsky, 1970; Karttunen, 1971; Nairn et al., 2006; Saurı́, 2008; Karttunen, 2012).\nWhile a possible way to address this issue is to construct verb classifications in a purely syntaxdriven way, exploiting the relationship between the syntactic behavior of verbs and their meaning (following, e.g., (Levin, 2015a)), this has not\nar X\niv :1\n50 9.\n03 48\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n1 Se\np 20\n15\nbeen done yet for verbs signaling modality as far as we are aware: the only large-scale verb classification which is based on syntactic behavior is VerbNet (Kipper et al., 2008) and this resource does not reflect fine-grained distinctions between various kinds of modality. The lack of syntactic grounding of existing semantic classifications also hinders the automatic identification of verb classes in corpora, as well as the corpus-based acquisition of new class members.\nWe address these issues and make the following contributions: (i) A replicable method to construct a semantic verb classification: We infer semantic classes of verbs signaling modality from a purely syntactic classification of 637 German AO selecting verbs by applying findings from linguistics about correspondences between verb syntax and meaning. (ii) An evaluation of the semantic verb classification based on linking lexical resources at the word sense level: by linking the inferred classification to the German wordnet GermaNet (Kunze and Lemnitzer, 2002), and its translation into English to VerbNet and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), we are able to perform a reproducible semantic characterization of the inferred German classes. (iii) An exploratory analysis of the frequency of the verb classes in German and English corpora from different genres. The results suggest that the verb classes might be useful features for various text classification tasks including genre discrimination."

      "text" : "Many AO selecting verbs denote what is called modality in linguistics. Modality is “the category of meaning used to talk about possibilities and necessities” (Hacquard, 2011). Different modality types are commonly distinguished: on the one hand, there are verbs denoting epistemic modality, i.e., possibilities and necessities given what is known, based on what the available evidence is. Epistemic modality is connected to factual AOs (e.g. discover, realize).\nOn the other hand, there are verbs denoting various types of non-epistemic modality, thus indi-\ncating the non-factuality of the AO. The following types of non-epistemic modality are relevant in our work:\ndoxastic modality expressing the subjects beliefs (e.g., assume, fear);\ndeontic modality expressing permissions and obligations (e.g., allow, order);\nabilitative modality expressing possibilities given the subjects abilities (e.g., dare, hesitate);\nteleological modality expressing particular goals (e.g., intend, plan);\nbouletic modality expressing particular desires (e.g., wish, hope)."

      "heading" : "2.2 Syntactic reflections of verb meaning",
      "text" : "Semantic verb classifications that are grounded in lexical-syntactic properties of verbs are particularly appealing, because they can automatically be recovered in corpora based on syntactic features. The most well known verb classification based on the correspondence between verb syntax and verb meaning is Levin’s classification (Levin, 1993). According to (Levin, 2015a), verbs that share common syntactic argument alternation patterns also have particular meaning components in common, thus they can be grouped into a semantic verb class. For example, verbs participating in the dative alternation1 can be grouped into an alternation class of verbs sharing particular meaning components. Recent work on verb semantics provides additional evidence for this correspondence of verb syntax and meaning: (Hartshorne et al., 2014) report that the syntactic behavior of some verbs can be predicted based on their meaning.\nVerbNet is a broad-coverage verb lexicon organized in verb classes based on Levin-style syntactic alternations: verbs with common subcategorization frames and syntactic alternation behavior that also share common semantic roles are grouped into VerbNet classes. VerbNet not only includes the verbs from the original verb classification by Levin, but also more than 50 additional verb classes (Kipper et al., 2006) automatically acquired from corpora (Korhonen and Briscoe, 2004). These classes contain many AO selecting verbs that were not covered by Levin’s classification. However, VerbNet does not provide infor-\n1These verbs can realize an argument syntactically either as noun phrase or as prepositional phrase with to.\nmation about the modal meaning of AO selecting verbs."

      "heading" : "2.3 Related work on modality in NLP",
      "text" : "Previous work in NLP on the automatic (and manual) annotation of modality has often tailored the concept of modality to particular applications. (Szarvas et al., 2012) introduce a taxonomy of different kinds of modality expressing uncertainty, such as deontic, bouletic, abilitative modality, and use it for detecting uncertainty in an Information Extraction setting. Their uncertainty cues also include verbs.\n(Saurı́ and Pustejovsky, 2012) use discrete values in a modality continuum ranging from uncertain to absolutely certain in order to determine the factuality of events mentioned in text. For determining the degree of factuality of a given text, they use classes of implicatives2, factives3 and perception verbs.\n(Nissim et al., 2013) introduce an annotation scheme for the cross-linguistic annotation of modality in corpora. Their annotation scheme defines two dimensions which are to be annotated (called layers): factuality (characterizing the embedded proposition or concept) and speaker’s attitude (characterizing the embedding predicate). Their annotation scheme starts from a fixed set of modal meanings and aims at finding previously unknown triggers of modality. However, some modal meanings are not distinguished, in particular those involving future-orientation. A classification approach grounded in syntax – as in our work – can be considered as complementary: it starts from the syntactic analysis of a large set of trigger words, and induces a broad range of modal meanings based on correspondences between verbs syntax and meaning.\nTo conclude, our work significantly extends previous work, which focused only on few kinds of modality expressed by AO selecting verbs. We present a broad-coverage semantic classification for AO selecting verbs signaling a wide range of different kinds of modality in text."

We apply this method to a large dataset of German AO selecting verbs. The research hypotheses underlying our method can be summarized as follows:\n• There are correspondences between verb syntax and meaning: certain syntactic alternations correspond to particular meaning components (Levin, 2015a).\n• The correspondences between verb syntax and meaning described for English largely apply to German as well, since English and German are related languages (Levin, 2015b)."

      "text" : "We apply our method to a set of 637 verbs taking clausal and non-finite arguments given in (EckleKohler, 1999). These verbs are a subset of a subcategorization lexicon (i.e., pairs of lemma and subcategorization frame) that has automatically been extracted from large newspaper corpora. There are 244 different subcategorization frames; each verb lemma has 1.9 subcategorization frames on average. (Eckle-Kohler, 1999) specified the alternation behavior of each verb regarding different syntactic categories of clausal and non-finite arguments, yielding a syntactic signature for each verb (e.g., 111101 for the verb einsehen (realize) using the encoding in Table 1, top to bottom corresponding to left to right).4 For this, each verb was inspected regarding its ability to take any of the considered clausal and nonfinite categories as argument – either on the basis of the automatically acquired subcategorization frames or by making use of linguistic introspection.5\nAlthough there are 64 possible syntactic signatures according to basic combinatorics, in the data only 46 signatures were found, which group the verbs into syntactic classes. While (Eckle-Kohler, 1999) points out a few semantic characteristics of these classes, most of them lack a semantic characterization.

Verbs that are able to alternatively take that and wh-clauses coerce interrogatives and declaratives into factual AOs that correspond to a particular fact (Ginzburg, 1996). Among the verbs showing the that-wh alternation are the well-known factive verbs (Kiparsky and Kiparsky, 1970). Factive verbs denote epistemic modality.\nThere is a further distinction among these verbs regarding the ability to take an embedded if/whether-question: (Schwabe and Fittler, 2009) show that the that-wh/if alternation is connected to objective verbs entailing the existence of an independent witness, whereas the that-wh alternation (i.e., an if/whether-question is not possible) occurs with non-objective verbs.\nAspectuals: the inability to take that-clauses and to-infinitives in the past tense. Recently, research efforts have increasingly addressed particular semantic aspects of to-infinitives. (Kush, 2011) has investigated AOs that can neither be realized as that-clause nor as to-infinitive in the past tense. These AOs are selected by control verbs and can be characterized as mental actions. (Kush, 2011) points out that the verbs selecting those AOs have an aspectual meaning in common.\nFuture orientation: to-infinitives in the present tense and the inability to take toinfinitives in the past tense. (Laca, 2012) has investigated verbs across English and Spanish that embed future-oriented AOs. Only future-oriented AOs can be used with future-oriented adverbials, such as tomorrow, and these AOs are often realized as non-finite constructions, e.g., to-infinitives. She points out that not only control verbs take future-oriented AOs, but also verbs expressing attitudes of preference.\nThis finding implies that such future-oriented AOs are typically incompatible with past-oriented adverbials (e.g., , such as yesterday) and verb forms in the past tense (e.g., ?She plans having finished the assignment yesterday.). Futureorientation is an inherent property of several types of non-epistemic modality: abilitative, deontic and teleological modality."

      "text" : "Based on these linguistic findings on meaning components grounded in syntax, we established a mapping between syntactic signatures and semantic properties, which we used to automatically infer semantic classes.\nThe key insight underlying the mapping between syntactic signatures and semantic properties (as given by the linguistic findings) is to collapse all syntactic signatures that match any of the considered semantic properties into a single signature containing underspecified slots. For example, the signature “1100–” for future-oriented verbs expresses (i) the ability of these verbs to take a thatclause or a to-infinitive in the present tense, and (ii) the inability to take a to-infinitive in the past tense and a wh-clause; whereas for the whether/if - clause and for the dependent declarative clause the signature remains underspecified and indicates that these argument types may or may not be possible.\nIn addition to the three types of linguistic findings summarized in the previous section, we also consider their combinations to infer classes, in order to cover all syntactic signatures found in the German dataset. For instance, we included ‘ ‘future-oriented factuals”, i.e., the that-wh alternation combined with to-infinitives in the present tense and the inability to take to-infinitives in the past tense, because this signature appeared in the data and shows that also weak forms of factuality\n(“it will most likely be factual at some point in the future”) can be expressed in language.\nTable 2 provides an overview of this mapping (which resulted in 8 classes) and the inferred semantic classification."

      "text" : "Our intrinsic evaluation of the inferred classification investigates its semantic characteristics by exploiting linkings between lexical-semantic resources at the word sense level.\nThe key intuition is that existing semantic classifications in lexical resources can be leveraged for a fine-grained semantic characterization of any given classification, thus shedding light on its semantic properties from different angles. For the evaluation of the inferred verb classification, we employ the UBY framework (Gurevych et al.,\n2012)6, offering tools for creating and accessing lexical resources that are linked on the word sense level and comply with the ISO standard Lexical Markup Framework (LMF).\nFigure 1 gives an overview of the UBY resources and sense linkings between them, which we used for our evaluation. In order to gain insights into different semantic aspects, we linked an UBY version of the syntactic classification to UBY versions of the following resources: the German wordnet GermaNet (version 9.0) to analyze the classification regarding its semantic fields, and the English resources VerbNet (version 3.2) and FrameNet (version 1.5)\nWhile there is a manual linking of VerbNet and FrameNet in UBY as part of the SemLink resource (Palmer, 2009), there is no sense linking for the subcategorization lexicon we consider. The graph-based method for creating sense alignments between pairs of resources available in the UBY framework (Matuschek and Gurevych, 2013) requires glosses and a dense network of sense relations. However, both types of information are not given in the subcategorization lexicon we want to link: this resource contains only subcategorization frames. Therefore we developed an automatic linking method that is based on subcategorization frame similarity."

Our implementation exploits the standardized format for subcategorization frames in UBY (Eckle-Kohler and Gurevych, 2012), which models subcategorization frames at a fine-grained level of individual syntactic arguments, and represents them uniformly (as far as this is possible) across German and English."

      "text" : "The cross-lingual linking of our verb classes to the English VerbNet consists of two steps: first, the manual translation of the AO-compatible verb senses into English, and second, the automatic linking of the translated English verbs to VerbNet.\nThe first step, the translation into English, seemed at first possible based on UBY as well: UBY provides a transitive cross-lingual linking of GermaNet and VerbNet via the Interlingual Index from EuroWordnet (ILI) and the WordNet – VerbNet mapping included in VerbNet. However, many of the translations included in the ILI were not present in VerbNet. Therefore, the main author of this paper, a native speaker of German with a good proficiency in English, translated the AOcompatible verb senses manually using Linguee7 and dictionaries. This took about 7 hours. For 23 German verbs, we could not find any equivalent lexicalized translation, because these verbs express very fine-grained semantic nuances. For example, we did not find an equivalent English verb for a few verbs in the aspectual class but only a translation consisting of an adjective in combination with to be. Examples include be easy (leichtfallen), be willing (sich bereitfinden), be capable (vermögen), which have German equivalents that are lexicalized as verbs. As a result, we arrived at translations for 614 out of 637 German verbs. These 614 German verbs are translated to 413 English verbs, indicating that the English translation has a more general meaning in many cases."

For VerbNet, the syntactic categories of the arguments have to match (for clausal arguments) or be identical (for all other arguments). In order to create a link to GermaNet, the complementizer of clausal arguments and the case of noun phrase arguments have to agree in addition.\nAccording to a manual evaluation, the automatic verb sense linking yielded an accuracy of 89.95% for the linking to GermaNet, and 87.54% for the linking to VerbNet (κ agreement on a random sample of 200 sense pairs annotated by two annotators was 0.7 and 0.8, respectively).

      "heading" : "4.4 Semantic characterization",
      "text" : "The linking to the GermaNet semantic fields shows that most verbs in the classification are either cognition or communication verbs; fewer verbs belong to the semantic fields social, emotion, change and perception. This reflects observations from the literature that mental attitude and speech act verbs are closely related, because speech is essentially the expression of thought (Vendler, 1972). Also, attitude verbs share many similarities with modals (Hacquard, 2011): they can have epistemic or non-epistemic interpretations (know, believe), also including bouletic (e.g., want, wish) or deontic (commands like order) interpretations.\nThe linking to VerbNet and FrameNet is summarized in Table 5. The salient target classes from VerbNet and FrameNet reveal meaning components that are on the one hand unique for individual classes, and on the other hand shared across\nseveral German classes:\n• The future-oriented class is characterized by object control verbs (e.g., force-59, forbid67 in VerbNet, and request, preventing in FrameNet), and by verbs denoting teleological modality (wish-62, promote-102).\n• The wh/if-factual class is unique regarding the cognition and perception verbs (e.g., discover-84, see-30.1-1, and perceptionexperience).\n• The future-directed wh/if-factual class also contains objective assessment verbs, as shown by the estimate-34.2 class.\n• The verbs in the two wh-factual classes share meaning components as well, as shown by the opinion verb classes admire-31.2 and defend-85 in VerbNet or judgment, tolerating in FrameNet.\nWhile there are also other VerbNet and FrameNet classes shared across several classes, they turned out to be very general and underspecified regarding their meaning, thus not contributing to a more fine-grained semantic characterization. For example, the conjecture-29.5 class assembles quite diverse conjecture verbs, e.g. verbs expressing opinion (feel, trust) and factuality (observe, discover). A similar observation holds for the statement frame in FrameNet.\nTo summarize, the results of our evaluation provide strong support for Levin’s theory of correspondences between syntactic argument alternation patterns (i.e., syntactic signatures) and meaning components, also across the language pair German – English."

While this is a high-precision approach, the linking is quite lossy, only able to link 46% of the verbs to GermaNet, 42% to VerbNet and 20% to FrameNet. Since we are not interested in individual sense links, but in the aggregation of sense links from whole classes, this kind of accurate linking perfectly suits the purpose of semantically characterizing the inferred verb classes, as long as the classes considered are large enough.\nThe evaluation shows that in addition to the modal meanings expressed by the classes (which have been induced from linguistic findings), there are additional semantic aspects to consider, such as the prevalence of object control verbs in the future-oriented class. In particular, the opinion verbs in the wh-factual classes vs. the objective cognition and perception verbs in the wh/iffactual classes provide additional evidence for the observation by (Schwabe and Fittler, 2009) that the that-wh/if alternation is connected to objective verbs, whereas the that-wh alternation occurs with non-objective verbs.\nIn order to assess the usefulness of the verb classification as a source of features for NLP applications, we investigated the verb class frequencies\nacross various corpora. We ranked all verbs in the 8 classes by their lemma frequency in three German corpora of different genres, see Table 6: encyclopedic text (the German Wikipedia9), a Web corpus (SDeWaC, a cleaned and pre-processed version of the German DeWaC corpus (Baroni and Kilgarriff, 2006)), and newspaper text (the Tiger corpus (Brants et al., 2004)).\nWe repeated the same analysis for the English version of the classification, using the Reuters21578 corpus.10 In order to count the occurrences of verb lemmas, we used readers and preprocessing components from the DKPro Core collection.11 Our verb counting pipeline counts occurrences of German particle verbs where the particle was separated as instances of the particle verb lemma.\nTable 6 shows that the large verb classes constitute a substantial proportion of verb occurrences across different genres. Comparing the proportions of classes in encyclopedic and Web text pairwise with those in news using significance testing indicates that, apart from the interrogative class in Web text versus news, all differences are significant.12 This suggests that the verb classes might be useful features for various text classification tasks."
