(ROSS stands for \"Representation\", \"Ontology\", \"Structure\", \"Star\" language). ROSS is a physical symbol-based representational scheme. ROSS provides a complex model for the declarative representation of physical structure and for the representation of processes and causality. From the metaphysical perspective, the ROSS view of external reality involves a 4D model, wherein discrete single-time-point unit-sized locations with states are the basis for all objects, processes and aspects that can be modeled. ROSS includes a language called \"Star\" for the specification of ontology classes. The ROSS method also includes a formal scheme called the \"instance model\". Instance models are used in the area of natural language meaning representation to represent situations. This document is an in-depth specification of the ROSS method.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 15 Nov 2014 22:47:35 GMT  (1237kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4194v1", "128 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "128 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL", "authors": ["glenn r hofford"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.4194"}
