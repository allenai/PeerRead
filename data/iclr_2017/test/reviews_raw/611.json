{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Collaborative Deep Embedding via Dual Networks", "abstract": "Despite the long history of research on recommender systems, current approaches still face a number of challenges in practice, e.g. the difficulties in handling new items, the high diversity of user interests, and the noisiness and sparsity of observations. Many of such difficulties stem from the lack of expressive power to capture the complex relations between items and users. This paper presents a new method to tackle this problem, called Collaborative Deep Embedding. In this method, a pair of dual networks, one for encoding items and the other for users, are jointly trained in a collaborative fashion.  Particularly, both networks produce embeddings at multiple aligned levels, which, when combined together, can accurately predict the matching between items and users. Compared to existing methods, the proposed one not only provides greater expressive power to capture complex matching relations, but also generalizes better to unseen items or users. On multiple real-world datasets, this method outperforms the state of the art.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "The responses to the pre-review questions are not strong; especially w.r.t. the question about dataset density and why the dataset had to be subsampled, the authors responded that subsampling is common in recommender systems work, including the papers cited. This isn't a particularly strong justification of why subsampling is a good idea, and in particular doesn't answer the question of \"how would the results look without subsampling,\" which I think is a question that could easily have been answered directly.\n\nEspecially given that the goal of dealing with the cold-start issue is so heavily emphasized in the paper, in seems odd to sample the data to reduce sparsity.\n\nOther than that, the pre-review questions seem to have been answered satisfactorily.\n\nThe contribution of the paper is to propose user and item embedding methods, as a means of learning complex non-linear interactions between users and items. This is fairly similar to recent work on deep RS, though the network formulation has some differences.\n\nOverall this is an reasonably put together paper that makes a contribution in an important area, though there are still some shortcomings that should be addressed, namely:\n1) The evaluation is unusual. Recall@M is the only result reported, though this is not usually an evaluation seen in recommender systems research. At the very least other performance measures (rmse or AUC) should be reported for completeness, even if the results are not strong\n2) Given that the contribution is fairly simple (i.e., the \"standard\" recommender systems task, but with a new model) it's a shame that unusual data samples have to be taken. This should be a case where it's possible to report results against competing methods using *exactly* the same data they used, and exactly the same error measure, for the fairest comparison possible.\n\nWithout the above it's hard to tell how much the performance improvements are really due to the method being better, versus the choice of datasets and the choice of loss functions.", "IS_META_REVIEW": true}, {"TITLE": "ICLR committee final decision", "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 pcs", "comments": "The paper presents a collaborative filtering method, using dual deep nets for users and items.

The major improvement comes from the coupling of user-item factors in prediction. While the motivation is clear, the improvement of the model architecture is minor. \nI think the author should improve the paper to discuss more on the impact of introduction of coupling, which might make this paper stronger. Specifically, conduct isolate experiment to change loss, architecture gradually, from a non-coupled network to a final proposed coupled network to demonstrate the importance of coupling.\nAnother important missing part of the paper seems to be time complexity. Since coupled net would be much more costly to generate recommendations, a discussion on how it would impact real world usages should be added.\nOverall, I think this is a paper that should be improved before accepted.\n", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 5, "DATE": "17 Dec 2016 (modified: 21 Dec 2016)", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer2", "TITLE": "official review", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The responses to the pre-review questions are not strong; especially w.r.t. the question about dataset density and why the dataset had to be subsampled, the authors responded that subsampling is common in recommender systems work, including the papers cited.
