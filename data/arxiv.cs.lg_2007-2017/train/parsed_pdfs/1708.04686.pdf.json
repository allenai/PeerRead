      "text" : "Connecting visual understanding with natural language has received extensive attentions in recent years. We have witnessed the resurgence of image captioning [42, 29, 18, 6, 40, 4, 47, 12, 33, 10] which is often addressed by jointly modeling visual and textual content with deep neural networks. However, image captions tend to be diverse and sub-\nCode and data: https://github.com/Cold-Winter/vqs.\njective — it is hard to evaluate the quality of captions generated by different algorithms [7, 41, 1], and tend to miss subtle details — in training, the models may be led to capturing the scene-level gist rather than fine-grained entities. In light of the premises and demerits of image captioning, visual question answering (VQA) [3, 51, 36, 13] and visual grounding [35, 15, 37, 28, 16, 43, 50] are proposed, in parallel, to accommodate automatic evaluation and multiple levels of focus on the visual entities (e.g., scene, object, activity, attribute, context, relationships, etc.).\nRich and dense human annotated datasets are arguably the main “enabler”, among others, for this line of exciting works on vision-language understanding. COCO [25] is especially noticeable among them. It contains mainly classical labels (e.g., segmentations, object categories and instances, key points, etc.) and image captions. Many research groups have then collected additional labels of the COCO images for a variety of tasks. Agrawal et al. crowdsourced questions and answers (QAs) about a subset of the COCO images and abstract scenes [3]. Zhu et al. collected seven types of QAs in which the object mentions are as-\n1\nar X\niv :1\n70 8.\n04 68\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 1\n5 A\nug 2\n01 7\nsociated with bounding boxes in the images [51]. Mao et al. [28] and Yu et al. [50] have users to give referring expressions that each pinpoints a unique object in an image. The Visual Genome dataset [22] also intersects with COCO in terms of images and provides dense human annotations, especially scene graphs.\nThese seemingly distant annotations are inherently connected in the sense that they reveal different perspectives of human understandings about the same COCO images. The popularity of COCO could strongly correlate those annotations — and even tasks. Explicitly linking them up, as we envision, can significantly benefit both individual tasks and unified vision-language understanding, as well as the corresponding approaches and models. One of our contributions in this paper is to initiate the preliminary work on this. In particular, we focus on linking the segmentations provided by COCO [25] to the QAs in the VQA dataset [3]. Displaying an image and a QA pair about the image, we ask the participant to choose the segmentation(s) of the image in order to visually answer the question.\nFigure 1 illustrates some of the collected “visual answers”. For the question “What is next to the dog?”, the output is supposed to be the segmentation mask over the man. For the question “What time is it?”, the clock should be segmented out. Another intriguing example is that the cars are the desired segmentations to answer “Is this street empty?”, providing essential visual evidence for the simple text answer “no”. Note that while many visual entities could be mentioned in a question, we only ask the participants to choose the target segmentation(s) that visually answer the question. This simplifies the annotation task and results in higher agreement between participants. Section 2 details the annotation collection process and statistics.\nTwo related datasets. Das et al. have collected some human attention maps for the VQA task [5]. They blur the images and then ask users to scratch them to seek visual cues that help answer the questions. The obtained attention maps are often small, revealing meaningful parts rather than complete objects. The object parts are also mixed with background areas and with each other. As a result, the human attention maps are likely less accurate supervision for the attention based approaches to VQA than the links we built between segmentations and QAs. Our experiments verify this hypothesis (cf. Section 3). While bounding boxes are provided in Visual7W [51] for object mentions in QAs, they do not serve for the purpose of directly answering the questions except for the “pointing” type of questions. In contrast, we provide direct visual answers in the form of segmentations to more question types."

      "text" : "VQA is designed to answer natural language questions about images in the form of short texts. The attention scheme is often found useful for VQA, by either attending particular image regions [48, 46, 45, 26, 24] or modeling object relationships [2, 27]. However, lacking explicit attention annotations, the existing methods opt for latent variables and use indirect cues (e.g., text answers) for inference. As a result, the machine-generated attention maps are poorly correlated with human attention maps [5]. This is not surprising since latent variables hardly match semantic interpretations due to the lack of explicit training signals; similar observations exist in other studies, e.g., object detection [8], video recognition [11] and text processing [49].\nThese phenomena highlight the need for explicit links between the visual and text answers, realized in this work as VQS. We show that, by supervised learning to attend different image regions using the collected segmentationQA links, we can boost the simple MLP model [17] to very compelling performance on the VQA real multi-choice task."

      "text" : "In addition to the supervised attention for better tackling VQA, VQS also enables us to explore a novel questionfocused semantic segmentation (QFSS) task.\nSince VQA desires only text answers, there exist potential shortcuts for the learning agent, e.g., to generate correct answers without accurately reasoning the locations and relations of different visual entities. While visual grounding (VG) avoids the caveat by placing bounding boxes [35, 37, 28, 16] or segmentations [15] over the target visual entities, the scope of the text expressions in existing VG works is often limited to the visual entities present in the image. In order to bring together the best of VQA and VG, we propose the QFSS task, whose objective is to produce pixel-wise segmentations in order to visually answer the questions about images. It effectively borrows the versatile questions from VQA and meanwhile resembles the design of VG in terms of the pixel-wise segmentations as the desired output.\nGiven an image and a question about the image, we propose a mask aggregation approach to generating a segmentation mask as the visual answer. Since QFSS is a new task, to put it in perspective, we not only compare the proposed approach to competing baselines but also study an upperbound method by assuming all instance segmentations are given as oracles at the test stage.\nHu et al.’s work [15] is the most related to QFSS. They learn to ground text expressions in the form of image segmentations. Unlike the questions used in this work that are flexible to incorporate commonsense and knowledge bases, the expressive scope of the text phrases in [15] is often limited to the visual entities in the associated images.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 details the collection process and analyses of our VQS data. In section 3, we show how to use the collected segmentation-QA links to learn supervised attention features and to augement the existing VQA methods. In section 3.2, we study a few potential frameworks to address the new question-focused semantic segmentation task. Section 4 concludes the paper."

      "text" : "We display to the annotators an image, its instance segmentations from the COCO dataset, and a QA pair about the image from the VQA dataset. The textual answer is given in addition to the question, to facilitate the participants to choose the right segmentations as the visual answer. Here are the instructions we give to the annotators (cf. the supplementary materials for the GUI): • Please choose the right segmentation(s) in the image\nto answer the question. Note that the text answer is shown after the question. • A question about the target entities may use other enti-\nties to help refer to the target. Choose the target entities only and nothing else (e.g., the purse for “What is on the bench next to woman?” in Figure 2(g)). • A question may be about an activity. Choose all visual\nentities involved in the activity. Taking Figure 2(j) for instance, choose both the person and motorcycle for the question “what is the person doing?”. • Sometimes, in addition to the image regions covered\nby the segmentation masks, you may need other regions to answer the question. To include them, please\ndraw tight bounding box(es) over the region(s). • For the “How many” type of questions, the number of\nselected segments (plus bounding boxes) must match the answer. If the answer is greater than three, it is fine to put one bounding box around the entities being asked in the question. • Please tick the black button under the question, if you\nthink the question has to be answered by the full image. • Please tick the gray button under the question, if you\nfeel the question is ambiguous, or if you are not sure which segment/region to select to answer the question. Occasionally, the visual answer is supposed to be only part of an instance segment given by COCO. For instance, the McDonald logo answers “What fast food restaurant can be seen?” in Figure 2(o) but there is no corresponding segmentation for the logo in COCO. Another example is the region of the ring that answers “Is the woman wearing ring?” (cf. Figure 2(c)). For these cases, we ask the participants to draw tight bounding boxes around them. If we segment them out instead, a learning agent for QFSS may never be able to produce the right segmentation for them unless we include more training images in the future, since these regions (e.g., McDonald logo, ring) are very fine-grained visual entities and show up only a few times in our data collection process. Quality control. We tried AMTurk to collect the annotations at the beginning. While the inter-annotator agreement is high on the questions about objects and people, there are many inconsistent annotations for the questions referring to activities (e.g., “What sport is played?”). Besides, the AMTurk workers tend to frequently tick the black button, which says the full image is the visual answer, and the gray button, which tells the question is ambiguous. To obtain higher-quality annotations, we instead invited 10 undergraduate and graduate volunteers and trained them in person (we include some slides used for the training in the supplementary materials). To further control the annotation quality, each annotator was asked to finish an assignment of 100 images (around 300 question-answer pairs) before we met with them again to look over their annotations together —\nall the volunteers were asked to participate the discussion and jointly decide the expected annotations for every question. We also gradually increased the hourly payment rate from $12/hr to $14/hr as incentives for high-quality work."

      "text" : "Thanks to the rich set of questions collected by Agrawal et al. [3] and the complex visual scenes in COCO [25], the participants have to parse the question, understand the visual scene and context, infer the interactions between visual entities, and then pick up the segmentations that answer the questions. We find that many vision tasks may play roles in this process. Figure 2 shows some typical examples to facilitate the following discussion.\nObject detection. Many questions directly ask about the properties of some objects in the images. In Figure 2(b), the participants are supposed to identify the cup in the cluttered scene for the question “What color is the coffee cup?”.\nSemantic segmentation. For some questions, the visual evidence to answers is best represented by semantic segmentations. Take Figures 2(j) and (k) for instance. Simply detecting the rider and/or the bike would be inadequate in expressing their spatial interactions.\nSpatial relationship reasoning. A question like “What is on the bench next to the woman?” (Figure 2(g)) poses a challenge to the participants through the spatial relationship between objects including bench, woman, and the answer purse. Figure 2(i) is another example in this realm.\nFine-grained activity recognition. When the question is about an activity (e.g., “What sport is being played?” in Figure 2(l)), we ask the participants to label all the visual entities (e.g., person, tennis racket , and tennis ball) involved. In other words, they are expected to spot the finegrained details of the activity.\nCommonsense reasoning. Commonsense knowledge can help the participants significantly reduce the search space for the visual answers, e.g., the clock to answer “What time is it?” in Figure 1, and the McDonald logo to answer “What fast food restaurant can be seen?” in Figure 2(o)."

In the following, we do not differentiate the segmentations from the bounding boxes for the ease of presentation and also for the sake that the bounding boxes are tight, small, and much fewer than the segmentations.\nFigure 3 counts the distribution of the possible number of instance segmentations selected per image in response to a question. Over 70% of questions are answered by one segmentation. On average, each question-image pair has 6.7 candidate segmentations, among which 1.6 are selected by the annotators as the visual answers.\nIn Figure 4, we visualize the distribution of question types. The most popular type is the “What” questions (46%). There are 31,135 “is/are” and “does/do” questions (32.1%).

The augmented MLP significantly improves upon the plain version and gives rise to state-of-the-art results on the VQA real multiple-choice task [3].\nExperiment setup.

We extract two types of features from an input image: ResNet [14] pool5 activation and attribute features [44], where the latter is the attribute detection scores. We implement an attribute detector by revising the output layer of ResNet. Particularly, given C = 256 attributes, we impose a sigmoid function for each attribute and then train the network using the binary cross-entropy loss. The training data is obtained from the COCO image captions [25]. We keep the most frequent 256 words as the attributes after removing the stop words.\nAttention features xatt. We further concatenate attention features xatt to the original input xiqa. The attention features are motivated by the weighted combination of image regional features and question features in [48, eq. (22)], where the the non-negative weight pi = f(Q, {ri}) for each image region is a function of the question Q and regional features {ri}. We borrow the network architecture as well as code implementation from Yang et al. [48, Section 3.3] for this function, except that we train this network by a cross-entropy loss to match the weights {pi} to the “groundtruth” attentions derived from the segmentations in our VQS dataset. In particular, we down-sample the segmentation map associated with each question-image pair to the same size as the number of image regions, and then l1 normalize it to a valid probability distribution. By training the network to match the weights pi = f(Q, {ri}) toward such attentions, we enforce larger weights for the regions that correspond to the user selected segmentations.\nThe upper panel of Figure 5 illustrates the process of extracting the attention features, and the bottom panel shows the MLP model [17] augmented with our attention features for the VQA real multiple-choice task."

Second, the attribute features for the images are actually quite effective. We gain 1.0% improvement over the plain MLP by replacing the ResNet image features with the attribute features (cf. the row of MLP + Attri. vs. MLP + ResNet). Nonetheless, by appending attention features to MLP + Attri., we can still observe 1.1% absolute gain.

In particular, we use N = 25 segmentation proposals e1, e2, · · · , eN generated by SharpMask [34] given an image. Each proposal is a binary segmentation mask of the same size as the image.\nWe then threshold a convex combination of these masks E = ∑ i siei as the final output in response to a questionimage pair, where the i-th combination coefficient si is determined by the question features xq and the representations zi of the i-th segmentation proposal through a softmax function, i.e., si = softmax(xTq Azi). We learn the model parameters A by minimizing an l2 loss between the the user selected segmentationsE? and the model generated segmentation maskE. Our current model is “shallow” but it is straightforward to make it deep, e.g., by stacking its output with the original input following the prior practice (e.g., memory network [45] and stacked attention network [48]).\nAn oracle upper bound. We devise an upper bound to the proposed method by 1) replacing the segmentation proposals with all the instance segmentations released by MS\nInput Inage Ground truthAggregation Deconvoulution\nCOCO, assuming they are available as oracles at testing, and 2) using a binary classifier to determine whether or not an instance segmentation should be included into the visual answer. The results can be considered an upper bound for our approach because the segmentations are certainly more accurate than the machine generated proposals, and the binary classification is arguably easier to solve than aggregating multiple masks. We re-train the MLP (eq. 1) for the binary classifier here; it now takes as input the concatenated features of a segmentation and a question.\nFigure 6 depicts the proposed approach and the upperbound method with a concrete question-image example.\nA baseline using deconvolutional network. Finally, we study a competitive baseline which is motivated by the textconditioned FCN [15]. As Figure 7 shows, it contains three components, a convolutional neural network (CNN) [23], a deconvolutional neural network (DeconvNet) [31], and a question embedding to attend the feature maps in CNN. All the images are resized to 224 × 224. The convolutional and deconvolutional nets follow the specifications in [31]. Namely, a VGG-16 [39] is trimmed till the last convolutional layer, followed by two fully connected layers, and then mirrored by DeconvNet. For the input question, we use an embedding matrix to map it to the same size as the feature map of the last convolutional layer.

The SharpMask we use is learned from the training set of MS COCO. Hence, we split our VQS data in such a way that our test set does not intersect with the training set for SharpMask. Particularly, we use 26,995 images and correspondingly 68,509 questions as our training set. We split the remaining images and questions to two parts: 5,000 images and associated questions for validation, and 5,873 images with 14,875 questions as the test set.\nResults. Table 3 reports the comparison results on QFSS, evaluated by intersection-over-union (IOU). In addition, the first three columns are about the number of different types of questions and the average numbers of user selected segmentations per question type. On average, more than one segmentations are selected for any of the question types.\nFirst of all, we note that the proposed mask aggregation outperforms the baseline DeconvNet and yet is significantly worse than its upper bound method. The mask aggregation is superior over DeconvNet partially because it has actually used extra supervised information beyond our VQS data; namely, the SharpMask is trained using all the instance segmentations in the training set of MS COCO. The upper bound results indicate there is still large room for the mask aggregation framework to improve; one possibility is make it deep in the future work.\nBesides, we find that the two question representations, bag-of-wrods (B) and word embedding (W), give rise to distinguishable results for either mask aggregation or DeconvNet. This observation is intriguing since it implies that the QFSS task is responsive to the question representation schemes. It is thus reasonable to expect that QFSS will both benefit from and advance the progress on joint vision and\nlanguage modeling methods.

Of course, too small regions would also result in trivial solutions since the visual cues in each region would be too subtle then.\nIn the Table 4, we report the VQA Real Multiple-Choice results on the Test-Dev by using different resolutions of the segmentation masks. We can observe that higher resolution leads to better VQA results. In some spirit, this implies the necessity of the accurate segmentation annotations for the supervised attention in VQA."

      "text" : "We use an ensemble of 10 models in our experiments for the VQA Real Multiple-Choice task (cf. Table 1 of the main text). Among them, five are trained using the attribute feature representations of the images and the other five are based on the ResNet features. We use the validation set to select the best 10 models as well as how to combine them by a convex combination of their decision values. After that, we test the ensemble on Test-Dev and Test-Standard, respectively.\nFor the VQS experiments, we use the ADAM [21] gradient descent to train the whole network with the learning\nrate 0.001 and batch size 16. It takes about one week on one Titan X GPU machine to converge after 15 epochs. We also report some additional results in Table 5 for our exploration of the LSTM language embedding in the DeconvNet approach. We observe that the LSTM language embedding model (L) gives rise to about 0.02 improvement over the bag-of-words (B) and word2vec embedding (W) on the challenging VQS task."

Many seemingly distant annotations (e.g., semantic segmentation and visual question answering (VQA)) are inherently connected in that they reveal different levels and perspectives of human understandings about the same visual scenes — and even the same set of images (e.g., of COCO). The popularity of COCO correlates those annotations and tasks. Explicitly linking them up may significantly benefit both individual tasks and the unified vision and language modeling. We present the preliminary work of linking the instance segmentations provided by COCO to the questions and answers (QAs) in the VQA dataset, and name the collected links visual questions and segmentation answers (VQS). They transfer human supervision between the previously separate tasks, offer more effective leverage to existing problems, and also open the door for new research problems and models. We study two applications of the VQS data in this paper: supervised attention for VQA and a novel question-focused semantic segmentation task. For the former, we obtain state-of-the-art results on the VQA real multiple-choice task by simply augmenting the multilayer perceptrons with some attention features that are learned using the segmentation-QA links as explicit supervision. To put the latter in perspective, we study two plausible methods and compare them to an oracle method assuming that the instance segmentations are given at the test stage.",
