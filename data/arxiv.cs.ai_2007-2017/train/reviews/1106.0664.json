The main purpose of these researches is to describe a restricted set of maximal tractable subalgebras, ideally in an exhaustive fashion with respect to the hosting algebras. In this paper we introduce a novel algebra for reasoning about Spatial Congruence, show that the satisfiability problem in the spatial algebra MC-4 is NP-complete, and present a complete classification of tractability in the algebra, based on the individuation of three maximal tractable subclasses, one containing the basic relations. The three algebras are formed by 14, 10 and 9 relations out of 16 which form the full algebra.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Jun 2011 14:51:33 GMT  (166kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.0664v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI", "authors": ["m cristani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.0664"}
