      "text" : "State-of-the-art morphological taggers require thousands of annotated sentences to train. For the majority of the world’s languages, however, sufficient large-scale annotation is not available and obtaining it would often be infeasible. Accordingly, an important road forward in low-resource NLP is the development of methods that allow for the training of high-quality tools from smaller amounts of data. In this work, we focus on transfer learning—we train a recurrent neural tagger for a low-resource language jointly with a tagger for a related highresource language. Forcing the models to share character-level features among the languages allows large gains in accuracy when tagging the lowresource languages, while maintaining (or even improving) accuracy on the high-resource language.\nRecurrent neural networks constitute the state of the art for a myriad of tasks in NLP, e.g., multilingual part-of-speech tagging (Plank et al., 2016), syntactic parsing (Dyer et al., 2015; Zeman et al., 2017), morphological paradigm completion (Cotterell et al., 2016, 2017) and language modeling\n(Sundermeyer et al., 2012; Melis et al., 2017); recently, such models have also improved morphological tagging (Heigold et al., 2016, 2017). In addition to increased performance over classical approaches, neural networks also offer a second advantage: they admit a clean paradigm for multitask learning. If the learned representations for all of the tasks are embedded jointly into a shared vector space, the various tasks reap benefits from each other and often performance improves for all (Collobert et al., 2011b). We exploit this idea for language-to-language transfer to develop an approach for cross-lingual morphological tagging.\nWe experiment on 18 languages taken from four different language families. Using the Universal Dependencies treebanks, we emulate a lowresource setting for our experiments, e.g., we attempt to train a morphological tagger for Catalan using primarily data from a related language like Spanish. Our results demonstrate the successful transfer of morphological knowledge from the highresource languages to the low-resource languages without relying on an externally acquired bilingual lexicon or bitext. We consider both the single- and multi-source transfer case and explore how similar two languages must be in order to enable highquality transfer of morphological taggers.1"

      "text" : "Many languages in the world exhibit rich inflectional morphology: the form of individual words mutates to reflect the syntactic function. For example, the Spanish verb soñar will appear as sueño in the first person present singular, but soñáis in the second person present plural, depending on the bundle of syntaco-semantic attributes associated with\n1While we only experiment with languages in the same family, we show that closer languages within that family are better candidates for transfer.

For concreteness, we list a more complete table of Spanish verbal inflections in Table 1. Note that some languages, e.g., Archi, Northeast Caucasian language, display a veritable cornucopia of potential forms with the size of the verbal paradigm exceeding 10,000 (Kibrik, 1998).\nStandard NLP annotation, e.g., the scheme in Sylak-Glassman et al. (2015), marks forms in terms of universal key-attribute pairs, e.g., the first person present singular is represented as [pos=V, per=1, num=SG, tns=PRES ]. This bundle of key-attributes pairs is typically termed a morphological tag and we may view the goal of morphological tagging to label each word in its sentential context with the appropriate tag (Oflazer and Kuruöz, 1994; Hajič and Hladká, 1998). As the part-of-speech (POS) is a component of the tag, we may view morphological tagging as a strict generalization of POS tagging, where we have significantly refined the set of available tags. All of the experiments in this paper make use of the universal morphological tag set available in the Universal Dependencies (UD) (Nivre et al., 2016). As an example, we have provided a Russian sentence with its UD tagging in Figure 1.\nTransferring Morphology. The transfer of morphology is arguably more dependent on the relatedness of the languages in question than other annotations in NLP, such as POS and named entity recognition (NER). POS lends itself nicely to a universal annotation scheme (Petrov et al., 2012) and traditional NER is limited to a small number of cross-linguistically compliant categories, e.g., PERSON and PLACE. Even universal dependency arcs employ cross-lingual labels (Nivre et al., 2016).\nMorphology, on the other hand, typically requires more fine-grained annotation, e.g., grammatical case and tense. It is often the case that one language will make a semantic distinction in the form (or at all) that another does not. For example, the Hungarian noun overtly marks 17 grammatical cases and Slavic verbs typically distinguish two aspects through morphology, while English marks none of these distinctions. If the word form in the source language does not overtly mark a grammatical category in the target language, it is nighimpossible to expect a successful transfer. For this reason, much of our work focuses on the transfer of related languages—specifically exploring how close two languages must be for a successful transfer. Note that the language-specific nature of morphology does not contradict the universality of the annotation; each language may mark a different subset of categories, i.e., use a different set of the universal keys and attributes, but there is a single, universal set, from which the key-attribute pairs are drawn. See Newmeyer (2007) for a linguistic treatment of cross-lingual annotation.\nNotation. We will discuss morphological tagging in terms of the following notation. We will consider two (related) languages: a high-resource source language `s and a low-resource target language `t. Each of these languages will have its own (potentially overlapping) set of morphological tags, denoted Ts and Tt, respectively. We will work with the union of both sets T = Ts ∪ Tt. An individual tag mi = [k1=v1, . . . , kM=vM ] ∈ T is comprised of universal keys and attributes, i.e., the pairs (ki, vi) are completely language-agnostic. In the case where a language does not mark a distinction, e.g., case on English nouns, the corresponding keys are excluded from the tag. Typically, |T | is large (see Table 3). We denote the set of training sentences for the high-resource source language as Ds and the set of training sentences for the lowresource target language asDt. In the experimental section, we will also consider a multi-source setting\nwhere we have multiple high-resource languages, but, for ease of explication, we stick to the singlesource case in the development of the model."

      "text" : "Character-level neural networks currently constitute the state of the art in morphological tagging (Heigold et al., 2017). We draw on previous work in defining a conditional distribution over taggings t for a sentence w of length |w| = N as\npθ(t | w) = N∏ i=1 pθ(ti | w), (1)\nwhich may be seen as a 0th order conditional random field (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) with parameter vector θ.2 Importantly, this factorization of the distribution pθ(t | w) also allows for efficient exact decoding and marginal inference in O(|T | · N)-time, but at the cost of not admitting any explicit interactions in the output structure, i.e., between adjacent tags.3 We parameterize the distribution over tags at each time step as\npθ(ti | w) = softmax (Wei + b) , (2) 2The parameter vector θ is a vectorization of all the parameters discussed below. 3As an aside, it is quite interesting that a model with the factorization in Equation (1) outperforms the MARMOT model (Müller et al., 2013), which focused on modeling higher-order interactions between the morphological tags, e.g., they employ up to a (pruned) 3rd order CRF. That such a model achieves state-of-the-art performance indicates, however, that richer source-side features, e.g., those extracted by our characterlevel neural architecture, are more important for morphological tagging than higher-order tag interactions, which come with the added unpleasantness of exponential (in the order) decoding.\nwhere W ∈ R|T |×n is an embedding matrix, b ∈ R|T | is a bias vector and positional embeddings ei\n4 are taken from a concatenation of the output of two long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTMs) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), folded forward and backward, respectively, over a sequence of input vectors. This constitutes a bidirectional LSTM (Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005). We define the positional embedding vector as follows\nei = [LSTM(v1:i); LSTM(vN,i+1)] , (3)\nwhere each vi ∈ Rn is, itself, a word embedding. Note that the function LSTM returns the last final hidden state vector of the network. This architecture is the context bidirectional recurrent neural network of Plank et al. (2016). Finally, we derive each word embedding vector vi from a characterlevel bidirectional LSTM embedder. Namely, we define each word embedding as the concatenation\nvi = [ LSTM ( 〈ci1 , . . . , ciMi 〉 ) ; (4)\nLSTM ( 〈ciMi , . . . , ci1〉 )] .\nIn other words, we run a bidirectional LSTM over the character stream. This bidirectional LSTM is the sequence bidirectional recurrent neural network of Plank et al. (2016). Note a concatenation of the sequence of character symbols 〈ci1 , . . . , ciMi 〉 results in the word string wi. Each of the Mi characters cik is a member of the set Σ. We take Σ to be the union of sets of characters in the languages considered.\nWe direct the reader to Heigold et al. (2017) for a more in-depth discussion of this and various additional architectures for the computation of vi; the architecture we have presented in Equation (5) is competitive with the best performing setting in Heigold et al.’s study."

We seek to learn a set of shared character embeddings for taggers in both languages together through optimization of a joint loss function that combines the high-resource tagger and the low-resource one.

Combining (a) with the character embeddings in (c) gives the vanilla morphological tagging architecture of Heigold et al. (2017). Combining (a) with (d) yields the language-universal softmax architecture and (b) and (c) yields our joint model for language identification and tagging.\nLmulti(θ) = ∑\n(t,w)∈Ds log pθ(t | w, `s) (5) + ∑ (t,w)∈Dt log pθ (t | w, `t) .\nCrucially, our cross-lingual objective forces both taggers to share part of the parameter vector θ, which allows it to represent morphological regularities between the two languages in a common embedding space and, thus, enables transfer of knowledge. This is no different from monolingual multitask settings, e.g., jointly training a chunker and a tagger for the transfer of syntactic information (Collobert et al., 2011b). We point out that, in contrast to our approach, almost all multi-task transfer learning, e.g., for dependency parsing (Guo et al., 2016), has shared word-level embeddings rather than character-level embeddings. See §6 for a more complete discussion.\nWe consider two parameterizations of this distribution pθ(ti | w, `). First, we modify the initial character-level LSTM embedding such that it also encodes the identity of the language. Second, we modify the softmax layer, creating a languagespecific softmax.\nLanguage-Universal Softmax. Our first architecture has one softmax, as in Equation (2), over all morphological tags in T (shared among all the languages). To allow the architecture to encode morphological features specific to one language, e.g., the third person present plural ending in Spanish is -an, but -ão in Portuguese, we modify the creation of the character-level embeddings. Specifically, we augment the character alphabet Σ with a distinguished symbol that indicates the language: id`. We then pre- and postpend this symbol to the character stream for every word before feeding the\ncharacters into the bidirectional LSTM Thus, we arrive at the new language-specific word embeddings, v`i = [ LSTM ( 〈id`, ci1 , . . . , ciMi ,id`〉 ) ; (6)\nLSTM ( 〈id`, ciMi , . . . , ci1 ,id`〉 )] .\nThis model creates a language-specific embedding vector vi, but the individual embeddings for a given character are shared among the languages jointly trained on. The remainder of the architecture is held constant.\nLanguage-Specific Softmax. Next, inspired by the architecture of Heigold et al. (2013), we consider a language-specific softmax layer, i.e., we define a new output layer for every language:\npθ (ti | w, `) = softmax (W`ei + b`) , (7)\nwhere W` ∈ R|T |×n and b` ∈ R|T | are now language-specific. In this architecture, the embeddings ei are the same for all languages—the model has to learn language-specific behavior exclusively through the output softmax of the tagging LSTM.\nJoint Morphological Tagging and Language Identification. The third model we exhibit is a joint architecture for tagging and language identification. We consider the following loss function: Ljoint(θ) = ∑\n(t,w)∈Ds log pθ(`s, t | w) (8) + ∑ (t,w)∈Dt log pθ (`t, t | w) ,\nwhere we factor the joint distribution as\npθ (`, t | w) = pθ (` | w) · pθ (t | w, `) . (9)\nJust as before, we define pθ (t | w, `) above as in Equation (7) and we define\npθ(` | w) = softmax ( u> tanh(V ei) ) , (10)\nwhich is a multi-layer perceptron with a binary softmax (over the two languages) as an output layer; we have added the additional parameters V ∈ R|T |×n and u ∈ R|T |. In the case of multi-source transfer, this is a softmax over the set of languages.\nComparative Discussion. The first two architectures discussed in §3.2 represent two possibilities for a multi-task objective, where we condition on the language of the sentence. The first integrates this knowledge at a lower level and the second at a higher level. The third architecture discussed in §3.2 takes a different tack—rather than conditioning on the language, it predicts it. The joint model offers one interesting advantage over the two architectures proposed. Namely, it allows us to perform a morphological analysis on a sentence where the language is unknown. This effectively alleviates an early step in the NLP pipeline, where language id is performed and is useful in conditions where the language to be tagged may not be known a-priori, e.g., when tagging social media data.\nWhile there are certainly more complex architectures one could engineer for the task, we believe we have found a relatively diverse sampling, enabling an interesting experimental comparison. Indeed, it is an important empirical question which architectures are most appropriate for transfer learning. Since transfer learning affords the opportunity to reduce the sample complexity of the “data-hungry” neural networks that currently dominate NLP research, finding a good solution for cross-lingual transfer in state-of-the-art neural models will likely be a boon for low-resource NLP in general."

We evaluate using average per token accuracy, as is standard for both POS tagging and morphological tagging, and per feature F1 as employed in Buys and Botha (2016).

Then, the key-specific F k1 values are averaged equally. Note that F1 is a more flexible metric as it gives partial credit for getting some of the attributes in the bundle correct, where accuracy does not.\nHyperparameters. Our networks are four layers deep (two LSTM layers for the character embedder, i.e., to compute vi and two LSTM layers for the tagger, i.e., to compute ei) and we use an embedding size of 128 for the character input vector size and hidden layers of 256 nodes in all other cases. All networks are trained with the stochastic gradient method RMSProp (Tieleman and Hinton, 2012), with a fixed initial learning rate and a learning rate decay that is adjusted for the other languages according to the amount of training data. The batch size is always 16. Furthermore, we use dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014). The dropout probability is set to 0.2.

As discussed in §2, the transfer of morphology is language-dependent. This intuition is borne out in the results from our study (see Table 4). We see that in the closer grouping of the Western Romance languages, i.e., Catalan, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish, it is easier to transfer than with Romanian, an Eastern Romance language. Within the Western grouping, we see that the close pairs, e.g., Spanish and Portuguese, are amenable to transfer. We find a similar pattern in the other language families, e.g., Russian is the best source language for Ukrainian, Czech is the best language source for Slovak and Finnish is the best source language for Estonian.\nMulti-Source Transfer. In many cases, we find that multiple sources noticeably improve the results over the single-source case. For instance, when we have multiple Romance languages as a source language, we see gains of up to 2%. We also see gains\nin the Northern Germanic languages when using multiple source languages. From a linguistic point of view, this is logical as different source languages may be similar to the target language along different dimensions, e.g., when transferring among the Slavic languages, we note that Russian retains the complex nominal case system of Serbian, but south Slavic Bulgarian is lexically more similar.\nPerformance Against the Two Baselines. As shown in Table 5 and Table 6, our model outperforms the projection tagger of Buys and Botha (2016) even though our approach does not utilize bitext, large-scale alignment or monolingual corpora—rather, all transfer between languages happens through the forced sharing of characterlevel features.7 Our model, does, however, require\n7 We would like to highlight some issues of comparability with the results in Buys and Botha (2016). Strictly speaking, the results are not comparable and our improvement over their method should be taken with a grain of salt. As the source code is not publicly available and developed in industry, we resorted to numbers in their published work and additional numbers\nannotation of a small number of sentences in the target language for training. We note, however, that this does not necessitate a large number of human annotation hours (Garrette and Baldridge, 2013).\nReducing Sample Complexity. Another interesting a point about our model that is best evinced in Figure 3 is the feature-based CRF approach seems to be a better choice for the low-resource setting, i.e., the neural model has greater sample complexity. However, in the multi-task scenario, we find that the neural tagger’s learning curve is even steeper. In other words, if we have to train a tagger on very little data, we are better off using a neural multi-task approach than a feature-based approach; preliminary attempts to develop a multitask version of MARMOT failed (see Figure 3)."

While follow-up work (Fossum and Abney, 2005; Das and Petrov, 2011; Täckström et al., 2012) has continually demonstrated the efficacy of projecting simple part-of-speech annotations, Buys and Botha (2016) were the first to show the use of bitext-based projection for the training of a morphological tagger for low-resource languages.\nAs we also discuss the training of a morphological tagger, our work is most closely related to Buys and Botha (2016) in terms of the task itself. We contrast the approaches. The main difference lies therein, that our approach is not projection-based and, thus, does not require the construction of a bilingual lexicon for projection based on bitext.\nRather, our method jointly learns multiple taggers and forces them to share features—a true transfer learning scenario. In contrast to projection-based methods, our procedure always requires a minimal amount of annotated data in the low-resource target language—in practice, however, this distinction is non-critical as projection-based methods without a small mount of seed target language data perform poorly (Buys and Botha, 2016)."

      "text" : "In terms of methodology, however, our proposal bears similarity to recent work in speech and machine translation–we discuss each in turn. In speech recognition, Heigold et al. (2013) train a cross-lingual neural acoustic model on five Romance languages. The architecture bears similarity to our multi-language softmax approach. Dependency parsing benefits from cross-lingual learning in a similar fashion (Guo et al., 2015, 2016).\nIn neural machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015), recent work (Firat et al., 2016; Zoph and Knight, 2016; Johnson et al.,\n2016) has explored the possibility of jointly train translation models for a wide variety of languages. Our work addresses a different task, but the undergirding philosophical motivation is similar, i.e., attack low-resource NLP through multi-task transfer learning. Kann et al. (2017) offer a similar method for cross-lingual transfer in morphological inflection generation."

      "heading" : "7 Conclusion",
      "text" : "We have presented three character-level recurrent neural network architectures for multi-task crosslingual transfer of morphological taggers. We provided an empirical evaluation of the technique on 18 languages from four different language families, showing wide-spread applicability of the method. We found that the transfer of morphological taggers is an eminently viable endeavor among related language and, in general, the closer the languages, the easier the transfer of morphology becomes. Our technique outperforms two strong baselines proposed in previous work. Moreover, we define standard low-resource training splits in UD for future research in low-resource morphological tagging. Future work should focus on extending the neural morphological tagger to a joint lemmatizer (Müller et al., 2015) and evaluate its functionality in the low-resource setting."
