      "text" : "Temporal expressions are words or phrases that refer to dates, times or durations. Resolving time expressions is an important task in information extraction (IE) that enables downstream applications such as calendars or timelines of events (Derczynski and Gaizauskas, 2013; Do et al., 2012; Ritter et al., 2012; Ling and Weld, 2010), knowledge base population (Ji et al., 2011), information retrieval (Alonso et al., 2007), automatically scheduling meetings from email and more. Previous work in this area has applied rule-based systems (Mani and Wilson, 2000; Bethard, 2013b; Chambers, 2013) or supervised machine learning on small collections of hand-annotated news documents (Angeli et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2014).\n1We will make our code and data available with the publication of this paper.\nSocial media especially contains time-sensitive information and requires accurate temporal analysis, for example, for detecting real-time cybersecurity events (Ritter et al., 2015; Chang et al., 2016), disease outbreaks (Kanhabua et al., 2012) and extracting personal information (Schwartz et al., 2015). However, most work on social media simply uses generic temporal resolvers and therefore suffers from suboptimal performance. The increasing research interest in temporal resolution focuses primarily on news articles and clinical texts (UzZaman et al., 2013; Bethard and Savova, 2016).\nResolving time expressions in social media is a non-trivial problem. Besides many spelling variations, time expressions are more likely to refer to future dates than in newswire. For the example in\nar X\niv :1\n60 8.\n02 90\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.I R\n] 9\nA ug\n2 01\nFigure 1, we need to recognize that Monday refers to the upcoming Monday and not the previous one to resolve to its correct normalized date (5/9/2016). We also need to identify that the word Sun is not referring to a Sunday in this context.\nIn this paper, we present a new minimally supervised approach to temporal resolution that requires no in-domain annotation or hand-crafted rules, instead learning from large quantities of unlabeled text in conjunction with a database of known events. Our approach is capable of learning robust time expression models adapted to the informal style of text found on social media.\nFor popular events, some related tweets (e.g. Figure 2) may contain explicit or other simple time mentions that can be captured by a generic temporal tagger. An open-domain information extraction system (Ritter et al., 2012) can then identify events (e.g. [Mercury, 5/9/2016]) by aggregating those tweets. To automatically generate temporally annotated data for training, we make the following novel distant supervision assumption:2\nTweets posted near the time of a known event that mention central entities are likely to contain time expressions that refer to the date of the event.\nSo that, other tweets (e.g. Figure 1) that contain the same named entity can be heuristically labeled as training data. Each tweet is associated with multiple overlapping labels that indicate the day of the week, day of the month, whether the event is in the past or future and other time properties of the event date in relation to the tweet’s creation date. In order to learn a tagger that can recognize temporal expressions at the word-level, we present a multiple-instance learning approach to model sentence and word-level tags jointly and handle overlapping labels. Using heuristically labeled data and the temporal tags predicted by the multiple-instance learning model as input, we then train a log-linear model that normalizes time expressions to calendar dates.\nBuilding on top of the multiple-instance learning model, we further improve performance using\n2We focus on resolving dates, arguably the most important and frequent category of time expressions in social media data, and leave other phenomenon such as times and durations to traditional methods or future work.\na missing data model that addresses the problem of errors introduced during the heuristic labeling process. Our best model achieves a 0.68 F1 score when resolving date mentions in Twitter. This is a 17% increase over SUTime (Chang and Manning, 2012), outperforming other state-of-the-art time expression resolvers HeidelTime (Strötgen and Gertz, 2013), TempEX (Mani and Wilson, 2000) and UWTime (Lee et al., 2014) as well. Our approach also produces a confidence score that allows us to trade recall for precision. To the best of our knowledge, TweeTIME is the first time resolver designed specifically for social media data.3 This is also the first time that distant supervision is successfully applied for end-to-end temporal recognition and normalization. Previous distant supervision approaches (Angeli et al., 2012; Angeli and Uszkoreit, 2013) only address the normalization problem, assuming gold time mentions are available at test time."

      "heading" : "2 System Overview",
      "text" : "Our TweeTIME system consists of two major components as shown in Figure 3:\n1. A Temporal Recognizer which identifies time expressions (e.g. Monday) in English text and outputs 5 different temporal types (described in Table 1) indicating timeline direction, month of year, date of month, day of week or no temporal information (NA). It is realized as a multipleinstance learning model, and in an enhanced version, as a missing data model.\n2. A Temporal Normalizer that takes a tweet with its creation time and temporal expressions tagged by the above step as input, and outputs their normalized forms (e.g. Monday → 5/9/2016). It is a log-linear model that uses both lexical features and temporal tags.\nTo train these two models without corpora manually annotated with time expressions, we leverage a large database of known events as distant supervision. The event database is extracted automatically from Twitter using the open-domain IE system\n3The closest work is HeidelTime’s colloquial English version (Strötgen and Gertz, 2012) developed from annotated SMS data and slang dictionary. Our TweeTIME significantly outperforms on Twitter data.\nproposed by Ritter et al. (2012). Each event consists of one or more named entities, in addition to the date on which the event takes place, for example [Mercury, 5/9/2016]. Tweets are first processed by a Twitter named entity recognizer (Ritter et al., 2011), and a generic date resolver (Mani and Wilson, 2000). Events are then extracted based on the strength of association between each named entity and calendar date, as measured by a G2 test on their co-occurrence counts. More details of the Event Extractor can be found in Section 5.1.\nThe following two sections describe the details of our Temporal Recognizer and Temporal Normalizer separately."

We propose a multiple-instance\nlearning model and a missing data model that are capable of learning word-level taggers given only sentence-level labels.\nOur recognizer module in is built using a database of known events as distant supervision. We assume tweets published around the time of a known event that mention a central entity are also likely to contain time expressions referring to the event’s date. For each event, such as [Mercury, 5/9/2016], we gather all tweets that contain the central entity Mercury and are posted within 7 days of 5/9/2016. We then label each tweet based on the event date in addition to the tweet’s creation date. The sentence-level temporal tags for the tweet in Figure 1 are: TL=future, DOW=Mon, DOM=9, MOY=May."

      "heading" : "3.1 Multiple-Instance Learning Temporal Tagging Model (MultiT)",
      "text" : "Unlike supervised learning, where labeled instances are provided to the learner, in multiple instance learning scenarios (Dietterich et al., 1997), the learner is only provided with bags of instances labeled as either positive (where at least one instance is positive) or all negative. This is a close match to our problem setting, in which sentences are labeled with tags that should be assigned to one or more words.\nWe represent sentences and their labels using a graphical model that is divided into word-level and sentence-level variables (as shown in Figure 4). Unlike the standard supervised tagging prob-\nlem, we never directly observe the words’ tags (z = z1, . . . , zn) during learning. Instead, they are latent and we only observe the date of an event mentioned in the text, from which we derive sentencelevel binary variables t = t1, . . . , tk corresponding to temporal tags for the sentence. Following previous work on multiple-instance learning (Hoffmann et al., 2011a; Xu et al., 2014), we model the connection between sentence-level labels and word-level tags using a set of deterministic-OR factors φsent.\nThe overall conditional probability of our model is defined as:\nP (t, z|w;θr)\n= 1\nZ k∏ i=1 φsent(ti, z)× n∏ j=1 φword(zj , wj)\n= 1\nZ k∏ i=1 φsent(ti, z)× n∏ j=1 eθ r ·f(zj ,wj)\n(1)\nwhere f(zj , wj) is a feature vector and\nφsent(ti, z) =  1 if ti = true ∧ ∃j : zj = i 1 if ti = false ∧ ∀j : zj 6= i 0 otherwise (2) We include a standard set of tagging features that\nincludes word shape and identity in addition to prefixes and suffixes. To learn parameters θr of the Temporal Tagger, we maximize the likelihood of the sentence-level heuristic labels conditioned on observed words over all tweets in the training corpus. Given a training instance w with label t, the gradient of the conditional log-likelihood with respect to the parameters is:\n∇P (t|w) = ∑\nz P (z|w, t;θr) · f(z,w)\n− ∑ t,z P (t, z|w;θr) · f(z,w)\n(3)\nThis gradient is the difference of two conditional expectations over the feature vector f: a “clamped” expectation that is conditioned on the observed words and tags (w, t) and a “free” expectation that is only conditioned on the words in the text, w, and ignores the sentence-level labels. To make the inference tractable, we use a Viterbi approximation that replaces the expectations with maximization. Because each sentence corresponds to more than one temporal tag, the maximization of the “clamped” maximization is somewhat challenging to compute. We use the approximate inference algorithm of Hoffmann et al. (2011a), that views inference as a weighted set cover problem, with worst case running time (|T | · |W |), where |T | is the number of all possible temporal tag values and |W | is the number of words in a sentence."

      "heading" : "3.2 Missing Data Temporal Tagging Model (MiDaT)",
      "text" : "While the multiple-instance learning assumption works well much of the time, it can easily be violated – there are many tweets that mention entities involved in an event but that never explicitly mention its date.\nThe missing data modeling approach to weakly supervised learning proposed by Ritter et. al. (2013) addresses this problem by relaxing the hard constraints of deterministic-OR factors, such as those described above, as soft constraints. Our missingdata model for weakly supervised tagging splits the sentence-level variables, t into two parts : m which represents whether a temporal tag is mentioned by at least one word of the tweet, and t′ which represents\nwhether a temporal tag can be derived from the event date. A set of pairwise potentials ψ(mj , t′j) are introduced that encourage (but don’t strictly require) agreement between mj and t′j , that is:\nψ(mj , t ′ j) = { αp, if t′j 6= mj αr, if t′j = mj\n(4)\nHere, αp (Penalty), and αr (Reward) are parameters for the MiDaT model. αp is the penalty for extracting a temporal tag that is not related to the event-date and αr is the reward for extracting a tag that matches the date.\nDuring learning, if the local classifier is very confident, it is possible for a word to be labeled with a tag that is not derived from the event-date, and also for a sentence-level tag to be ignored, although either case will be penalized by the agreement potentials, ψ(mj , t′j), in the global objective. We use a local-search approach to inference that was empirically demonstrated to nearly always yield exact solutions by Ritter et. al. (2013)."

      "text" : "The Temporal Normalizer is built using a log-linear model which takes the tags t produced by the Temporal Recognizer as input and outputs one or more dates mentioned in a tweet. We formulate date normalization as a binary classification problem: given a tweet w published on date dpub, we consider 22 candidate target dates (w, dcandl ) such that d cand l = dpub + l, where l = −10, . . . ,−1, 0,+1, . . . ,+10, limiting the possible date references that are considered within 10 days before or after the tweet creation date, in addition to dcandl = null (the tweet does not mention a date). 4 While our basic approach has the limitation, that it is only able to predict dates within ±10 days of the target date, we found that in practice the majority of date references on social media fall within this window. Our approach is also able to score dates outside this range that are generated by traditional approaches to resolving time expressions, as described in Section 5.3.3.\n4Although the temporal recognizer is trained with tweets from ±7 days around the event date, we found that extending the candidate date range to ±10 days for the temporal normalizer increased the performance of TweeTIME in the dev set.\nThe classifier is similarly trained using the event database as distant supervision. The probability that a tweet mentions a candidate date is estimated using a log-linear model:\nP (dcand|w, dpub) ∝ eθn·g(w,dpub,t) (5)\nwhere θn and g are the parameter and feature vector respectively in the Temporal Normalizer. For every tweet and candidate date pair (w, dcandl ), we extract the following set of features:\nTemporal Tag Features that indicate whether the candidate date agrees with the temporal tags extracted by the Temporal Recognizer. Three cases can happen here: The recognizer can extract a tag that can not be derived from the candidate date; The recognizer can miss a tag derived from the candidate date; The recognizer can extract a tag that is derived from the candidate date.\nLexical Features that include two types of binary features from the tweet: 1) Word Tag features consist of conjunctions of words in the tweet and tags associated with the candidate date. We remove URLs, stop words and punctuation; 2) Word POS features that are the same as above, but include conjunctions of POS tags, words and temporal tags derived from the candidate date.\nTime Difference Features are numerical features that indicate the distance between the creation date and the candidate date. They include difference of day ranges form -10 to 10 and the difference of week ranges from -2 to 2."

These tweets were automatically annotated with named entities, POS tags and TempEx dates (Ritter et al., 2011).\nFrom this automatically-annotated corpus we extract the top 10, 000 events and their corresponding dates using the G2 test, which measures the strength of association between an entity and date using the log-likelihood ratio between a model in which the entity is conditioned on the date and a model of independence (Ritter et al., 2012). Events extracted using this approach then simply consist of the highest-scoring entity-date pairs, for example [Mercury, 5/9/2016].\nAfter automatically extracting the database of events, we next gather all tweets that mention an entity from the list that are also written within ±7 days of the event. These tweets and the dates of the known events serve as labeled examples that are likely to mention a known date.\nWe also include a set of pseudo-negative examples, that are unlikely to refer to any event, by gathering a random sample of tweets that do not mention any of the top 10, 000 events and where TempEx does not extract any date."

As noted in previous work on distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009a), this type of evaluation usually under-estimates precision, however it provides us with a useful intrinsic measure of performance.\nIn order to provide even coverage of months in the training and test set, we divide the twitter corpus into 3 subsets based on the mod-5 week of each tweet’s creation date. To train system we use tweets that are created in 1st, 2nd or 3rd weeks. To tune parameters of the MiDaT model we used tweets from 5th weeks, and to evaluate the performance of the trained model we used tweets from 4th weeks.\nThe performance of the MiDaT model varies with the penalty and reward parameters. To find a (near) optimal setting of the values we performed a grid search on the dev set and found that a penalty of\n−25 and reward of 500 works best. A comparison of MultiT and MiDaT’s performance at predicting heuristically generated labels is shown in Table 2.\nThe word level tags predicted by the temporal recognizer are used as the input to the temporal normalizer, which predicts the referenced date from each tweet. The overall system’s performance at predicting event dates on the automatically generated test set, compared against SUTime, is shown in Table 3."

Notable rulebased systems such as TempEx (Mani and Wilson, 2000), SUTime (Chang and Manning, 2012) and HeidelTime (Strötgen and Gertz, 2013) provide particularly competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art machine learning methods. Probabilistic approaches use supervised classifiers trained on in-domain annotated data (Kolomiyets and Moens, 2010; Bethard, 2013a; Filannino et al., 2013) or hybrid with hand-engineered rules (UzZaman and Allen, 2010; Lee et al., 2014). UWTime (Lee et al., 2014) is one of the most recent and competitive systems and uses Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG).\nAlthough the recent research challenge TempEval (UzZaman et al., 2013; Bethard and Savova, 2016) offers an evaluation in the clinical domain besides newswire, most participants used the provided annotated corpus to train supervised models in addition to employing hand-coded rules. Previous work on adapting temporal taggers primarily focus on scaling up to more languages. HeidelTime was extended to multilingual (Strötgen and Gertz, 2015), colloquial (SMS) and scientific texts (Strötgen and Gertz, 2012) using dictionaries and additional in-domain annotated data. One existing work used distant supervision (Angeli et al., 2012; Angeli and Uszkoreit, 2013), but for normalization only, assuming gold time mentions as input. They used an EM-style bootstrapping approach and a CKY parser. Distant Supervision has recently become popular in natural language processing. Much of the\nwork has focused on the task of relation extraction (Craven and Kumlien, 1999; Bunescu and Mooney, 2007; Mintz et al., 2009b; Riedel et al., 2010; Hoffmann et al., 2011b; Nguyen and Moschitti, 2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2013; Ritter et al., 2013; Angeli et al., 2014). Recent work also shows exciting results on extracting named entities (Ritter et al., 2011), emotions (Purver and Battersby, 2012), sentiment (Marchetti-Bowick and Chambers, 2012), as well as finding evidence in medical publications (Wallace et al., 2016). Our work is closely related to the joint word-sentence model that exploits multiple-instance learning for paraphrase identification (Xu et al., 2014) in Twitter."

We presented a method for learning a wordlevel temporal tagging models from tweets that are heuristically labeled with only sentence-level labels. This approach was further extended to account for the case of missing tags, or temporal properties that are not explicitly mentioned in the text of a tweet. These temporal tags were then combined with a variety of other features in a novel date-resolver that predicts normalized dates referenced in a Tweet. By learning from large quantities of in-domain data, we were able to achieve 0.68 F1 score on the end-to-end time normalization task for social media data, significantly outperforming SUTime, TempEx, HeidelTime and UWTime on this challenging dataset for time normalization."

Most previous work in social media analysis has to rely on temporal resolvers that are designed for well-edited text, and therefore suffer from the reduced performance due to domain mismatch. We present a minimally supervised method that learns from large quantities of unlabeled data and requires no hand-engineered rules or hand-annotated training corpora. TweeTIME achieves 0.68 F1 score on the end-to-end task of resolving date expressions, outperforming a broad range of state-of-the-art systems.1",
