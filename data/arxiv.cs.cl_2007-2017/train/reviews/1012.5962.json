{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "29-Dec-2010", "title": "Annotated English", "abstract": "This document presents Annotated English, a system of diacritical symbols which turns English pronunciation into a precise and unambiguous process. The annotations are defined and located in such a way that the original English text is not altered (not even a letter), thus allowing for a consistent reading and learning of the English language with and without annotations. The annotations are based on a set of general rules that make the frequency of annotations not dramatically high. This makes the reader easily associate annotations with exceptions, and makes it possible to shape, internalise and consolidate some rules for the English language which otherwise are weakened by the enormous amount of exceptions in English pronunciation. The advantages of this annotation system are manifold. Any existing text can be annotated without a significant increase in size. This means that we can get an annotated version of any document or book with the same number of pages and fontsize. Since no letter is affected, the text can be perfectly read by a person who does not know the annotation rules, since annotations can be simply ignored. The annotations are based on a set of rules which can be progressively learned and recognised, even in cases where the reader has no access or time to read the rules. This means that a reader can understand most of the annotations after reading a few pages of Annotated English, and can take advantage from that knowledge for any other annotated document she may read in the future.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 29 Dec 2010 15:40:09 GMT  (72kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.5962v1", "Keywords: English spelling, English pronunciation, Phonetic rules, Diacritics, Pronunciation without Respelling, Spelling Reform. 68 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 30 Dec 2010 10:21:09 GMT  (72kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.5962v2", "Keywords: English spelling, English pronunciation, Phonetic rules, Diacritics, Pronunciation without Respelling, Spelling Reform. 68 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Keywords: English spelling, English pronunciation, Phonetic rules, Diacritics, Pronunciation without Respelling, Spelling Reform. 68 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL", "authors": ["jose hernandez-orallo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1012.5962"}
