      "text" : "Neural machine translation (NMT) has gained popularity in recent two years (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Jean et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015), especially for the attention-based models of Bahdanau et al. (2014).\nThe attention model plays a crucial role in NMT, as it shows which source word(s) the model should focus on in order to predict the next target word. However, the attention or alignment quality of NMT is still very low (Mi et al., 2016a; Tu et al., 2016).\nIn this paper, we alleviate the above issue by utilizing the alignments (human annotated data or machine alignments) of the training set. Given the alignments of all the training sentence pairs, we add an alignment distance cost to the objective function. Thus, we not only maximize the log translation probabilities, but also minimize the alignment distance cost. Large-scale experiments over Chineseto-English on various test sets show that our best method for a single system improves the translation quality significantly over the large vocabulary NMT system (Section 5) and beats the state-of-theart syntax-based system."

At each time t, the probability of each word yt from a target vocabulary Vy is:\np(yt|h, y∗t−1..y∗1) = g(st, y∗t−1), (1)\nwhere g is a two layer feed-forward neural network over the embedding of the previous word y∗t−1, and the hidden state st.

However, the accuracy is still far behind the traditional MaxEnt alignment model in terms of alignment F1 score (Mi et al., 2016b; Tu et al., 2016). Thus, in this section, we explicitly add an alignment distance to the objective function in Eq. 5. The “truth” alignments for each sentence pair can be from human annotated data, unsupervised or supervised alignments (e.g. GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) or MaxEnt (Ittycheriah and Roukos, 2005)).\nGiven an alignment matrix A for a sentence pair (x,y) in Figure 2 (a), where we have an end-ofsource-sentence token 〈eos〉 = xl, and we align all the unaligned target words (y∗3 in this example) to 〈eos〉, also we force y∗m (end-of-target-sentence) to be aligned to xl with probability one.

      "text" : "We run our experiments on Chinese to English task. The training corpus consists of approximately 5 million sentences available within the DARPA BOLT Chinese-English task. The corpus includes a mix of newswire, broadcast news, and webblog. We do not include HK Law, HK Hansard and UN data. The Chinese text is segmented with a segmenter trained on CTB data using conditional random fields (CRF). Our development set is the concatenation of several tuning sets (GALE Dev, P1R6 Dev, and Dev 12) initially released under the DARPA GALE program. The development set is 4491 sentences in total. Our test sets are NIST MT06 (1664 sentences) , MT08 news (691 sentences), and MT08 web (666 sentences).\nFor all NMT systems, the full vocabulary size of the training set is 300k. In the training procedure, we use AdaDelta (Zeiler, 2012) to update model parameters with a mini-batch size 80. Following Mi et al. (2016a), the output vocabulary for each mini-batch or sentence is a sub-set of the full vo-\ncabulary. For each source sentence, the sentencelevel target vocabularies are union of top 2k most frequent target words and the top 10 candidates of the word-to-word/phrase translation tables learned from ‘fast align’ (Dyer et al., 2013). The maximum length of a source phrase is 4. In the training time, we add the reference in order to make the translation reachable.\nThe Cov. LVNMT system is a re-implementation of the enhanced NMT system of Mi et al. (2016a), which employs a coverage embedding model and achieves better performance over large vocabulary NMT Jean et al. (2015). The coverage embedding dimension of each source word is 100.\nFollowing Jean et al. (2015), we dump the alignments, attentions, for each sentence, and replace UNKs with the word-to-word translation model or the aligned source word.\nOur traditional SMT system is a hybrid syntaxbased tree-to-string model (Zhao and Al-onaizan, 2008), a simplified version of the joint decoding (Liu et al., 2009; Cmejrek et al., 2013). We parse the Chinese side with Berkeley parser, and align the bilingual sentences with GIZA++ and MaxEnt. and extract Hiero and tree-to-string rules on the training set. Our language models are trained on the English side of the parallel corpus, and on monolingual corpora (around 10 billion words from Gigaword (LDC2011T07).We tune our system with PRO (Hopkins and May, 2011) to minimize (TER-\nBLEU)/2 1 on the development set."

      "heading" : "5.2 Translation Results",
      "text" : "Table 1 shows the translation results of all systems. The syntax-based statistical machine translation model achieves an average (TER-BLEU)/2 of 13.36 on three test sets. The Cov. LVNMT system achieves an average (TER-BLEU)/2 of 14.24, which is about 0.9 points worse than Tree-to-string SMT system. Please note that all systems are single systems. It is highly possible that ensemble of NMT systems with different random seeds can lead to better results over SMT.\nWe test three different alignments:\n• Zh→ En (one direction of GIZA++),\n• GDFA (the “grow-diag-final-and” heuristic merge of both directions of GIZA++),\n• MaxEnt (trained on 67k hand-aligned sentences).\n1The metric used for optimization in this work is (TERBLEU)/2 to prevent the system from using sentence length alone to impact BLEU or TER. Typical SMT systems use target word count as a feature and it has been observed that BLEU can be optimized by tweaking the weighting of the target word count with no improvement in human assessments of translation quality. Conversely, in order to optimize TER shorter sentences can be produced. Optimizing the combination of metrics alleviates this effect (Arne Mauser and Ney, 2008).\nThe alignment quality improves from Zh → En to MaxEnt. We also test different optimization strategies: J (jointly), A (alignment only), and T (translation model only). A combination, A→ T, shows that we optimize A only first, then we fix A and only update T part. Gau. denotes the smoothed transformation (Section 3.2). Only the last row uses the smoothed transformation, all others use the simple transformation.\nExperimental results in Table 1 show some interesting results. First, with the same alignment, J joint optimization works best than other optimization strategies (lines 3 to 6). Unfortunately, breaking down the network into two separate parts (A and T) and optimizing them separately do not help (lines 3 to 5). We have to conduct joint optimization J in order to get a comparable or better result (lines 3, 5 and 6) over the baseline system.\nSecond, when we change the training alignment seeds (Zh→En, GDFA, and MaxEnt) NMT model does not yield significant different results (lines 6 to 8).\nThird, the smoothed transformation (J + Gau.) gives some improvements over the simple transformation (the last two lines), and achieves the best result (1.2 better than LVNMT, and 0.3 better than Tree-to-string). In terms of BLEU scores, we conduct the statistical significance tests with the signtest of Collins et al. (2005), the results show that the improvements of our J + Gau. over LVNMT are significant on three test sets (p < 0.01).\nAt last, the brevity penalty (BP) consistently gets better after we add the alignment cost to NMT objective. Our alignment objective adjusts the translation length to be more in line with the human references accordingly."

      "heading" : "5.3 Alignment Results",
      "text" : "Table 2 shows the alignment F1 scores on the alignment test set (447 hand aligned sentences). The MaxEnt model is trained on 67k hand-aligned sentences, and achieves an F1 score of 75.96. For NMT systems, we dump the alignment matrixes and convert them into alignments with following steps. For each target word, we sort the alphas and add the max probability link if it is higher than 0.2. If we only tune the alignment component (A in line 3), we improve the alignment F1 score from 45.76 to 47.87.\nAnd we further boost the score to 50.97 by tuning alignment and translation jointly (J in line 7). Interestingly, the system using MaxEnt produces more alignments in the output, and results in a higher recall. This suggests that using MaxEnt can lead to a sharper attention distribution, as we pick the alignment links based on the probabilities of attentions, the sharper the distribution is, more links we can pick. We believe that a sharp attention distribution is a great property of NMT.\nAgain, the best result is J + Gau. in the last row, which significantly improves the F1 by 5 points over the baseline Cov. LVNMT system. When we use MaxEnt alignments, J + Gau. smoothing gives us about 1.7 points gain over J system. So it looks interesting to run another J + Gau. over GDFA alignment.\nTogether with the results in Table 1, we conclude that adding the alignment cost to the training objective helps both translation and alignment significantly."
