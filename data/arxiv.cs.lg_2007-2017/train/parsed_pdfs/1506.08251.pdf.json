      "text" : "Attention-based recurrent neural networks (RNN) have shown great success in a wide range of tasks such as computer vision [1, 2, 3],image generation [4, 5], machine translation [6], speech recognition [7], or even as controllers for memory addressing and retrieval [8, 9].\nWhile there is debate as to how biologically plausible these cognition models are, they are desirable in their ability to allow introspection into the network’s workings and understanding failures: in the case of image captioning [2, 1] and generation [4, 5], or emotion detection [10], the system’s focus matches up with human intuition. The gates modulating the network’s attention in these networks serve a dual purpose: first they allow control of the information flow, and second, and perhaps more crucially, the gates communicate problem structure by ensuring that specific groups of neurons activate or go dormant jointly. For instance, in the case of prediction from a sequence of words, it is expected to find that certain words are predictive while others not; if this word sequence is projected using an embedding matrix into word vectors, then by the same logic all the dimensions of superfluous words’ vectors should be wiped out entirely.\nIntuitively, this Occam’s Razor observation can be translated into considering that the activation of gating units should be as sparse as possible when not all the words or information units are necessary. The main focus of this paper is to show how to enforce sparsity on gating units by adding an unsupervised training objective: the sum of the activations of the gating units gi weighed by a hyper-parameter λsparse that controls the tradeoff between the original objective function J and the sparsity criterion:\nJ∗ = J + λsparse · ∑ i gi.\nIn this work, we show that enforcing gate sparsity improves generalization in RNNs while also providing useful visualisations of the problem, and evaluate this approach on three different problems."

      "text" : "RNN regularization has recently been shown to be achievable using Dropout [11] by regularizing a subset of the recurrent connections in deep RNNs [12, 13]. Previously, it was shown that weight decay regularization only provided small improvement [5] and dropout noise was detrimental when applied to all connections due to the compounding of errors over time [14]. In this work, we show that this problem can also be solved using a deterministic approach by penalizing gate activations from deep RNNs. As a result, RNNs can now benefit from multiple regularization techniques in varying architectures."

      "heading" : "2.2 Attention-Based Models",
      "text" : "In recent years, there has been a wealth of evidence that attention-based techniques can improve the performance of machine learning models. Examples of this include work on capturing visual structure through a sequence of glimpses through images [4, 15, 3, 1, 2, 10], and networks that learn how to attend to and control a separate memory [8, 16, 17].\nIn certain cases the models are trained with supervision on the gates [1, 16], however in many cases there is no supervised data for the attentional component. Several surrogate objectives have been suggested for learning where to focus, including setting a prior on observation spacing that makes a tradeoff between exploration and exploitation [10], using reinforcement learning [9] to optimize a visual tracking strategy [3], or leaving this part semi-supervised through the primary objective. Our work resembles the observation prior of [10], where we favor input gates being closed and penalize deviation with a penalty of our choosing. Similarly to the annealed Dropout from [18], we also consider a gradual increase in the sparsity penalty during training to encourage early exploration."

This dataset is made up of the sentiment annotations from 5 classes: {terrible, bad, neutral, good, terrific}, for the 215,154 unique sub-phrases obtained after parsing each sentence using the Stanford Parser.

      "heading" : "4 Approach",
      "text" : "In order to improve RNN performance over unseen data apply Occam’s Razor over our training data by finding in each example a minimal set of useful inputs over time. To achieve this property we apply gates to the different observations of the input sequence to allow the network to keep or erase a timestep’s input. For instance, in a sentiment classification problem, gates would ideally fire only for emotionally loaded words, and stay dormant otherwise.\nBecause our approach relies on gates, we make the assumption that the vector input at each time-step is an inseparable information unit, like a word, image, or fact. If this assumption holds, then when we force the network to reduce its gate usage by penalizing the sum of those activations, we will obtain a solution in a local optima where gates are less often active, which should generalize better.\nWe formalise our approach by describing how we enforce sparsity on the gate activations for a variety of RNNs. Then we introduce the RNNs considered for the different tasks in this paper. Finally we explain the sparsity-enforcing objective function and our different annealing regimens during training."

Since their introduction in 1995, many variants have been proposed [30], however for the purposes of this research we found that the vanilla version from [30] worked best.\nWhile LSTMs are capable of selectively remembering or forget parts of their memory and input, they lack the ability to transform uniformly their input. We extend LSTMs to include an additional gate, goccam, that uniformly multiplies all the inputs simultaneously. In Table 1 we present equations for the Gated-LSTM, with the differences with the regular LSTM highlighted in red. We use the following denotations: σ(·) for the logistic sigmoid function, Wi,z,f,o and Ri,z,f,o for matrices, and~bz,i,f,o for vectors.\nThe gating function fgate(·) can take various forms. Two examples we consider are linear function of the input ~xt and a second order gate capable of capturing higher-order interaction:\nflinear(~xt,~ht−1) = σ(~p T · ~xt + ~qT · ~ht−1 + b)\nfquad(~xt,~ht−1) = σ(~h T ·W · ~xT + ~pT · ~xt + ~qT · ~ht−1 + b).\nAdditionally, we consider Gated Stacked LSTMs, a variant of Stacked LSTMs [31, 5, 20], where the input the lowest LSTM is gated using the hidden state from the topmost LSTM of the previous timestep. The equation for this modification is as follows, with l ∈ {1, lmax}, the LSTM level:\ngoccam = fgate(~xt,~h(lmax,t−1))."

In the previous section we introduced Gated LSTMs that are able to selectively ignore or include the entire input at a timestep, however for many tasks where the information presented can be subdivided into larger chunks such as sentences, paragraphs, or episodes, a similar gating procedure could be applied to these higher levels of abstraction. For example to find the answer to question about a story in the bAbI dataset, such a model would benefit from being selective about which words and facts to listen to.\nHG-LSTM consists of two submodels: a Fact model and High-Level model (HL model), which are both Gated LSTMs. Figure 1 presents the architecture. Every word in a fact sequence is projected using an embedding matrix and processed by the Fact model. The final hidden state of the Fact model for each fact is then passed to the HL model as an input vector. We consider the final hidden state of the HL model after reading each fact representation to be a the high-level representation for the entire sequence of facts. The hierarchy of the submodels explicitly leverages the problem structure, and allows fine grain attention control at two levels of abstraction."

For fact selection errorEfact a set of supporting facts S is known, therefore rather than using sparsity penalty, we used cross entropy error between expected (1 for f ∈ S and 0 otherwise) and actual gate activation. F is set of fact indexes, gi is activation of gate for fact i. The µunsupporting coefficient was introduced because authors reasoned that false negatives are potentially more harmful than false negatives for network learning process.

Additionally for three arg. relations bAbI problem it increases the accuracy by 14%. We observe greater improvements on this task than the other two; notably, this task has longer sentences, and thus word gating is more present.\nMoreover, the sparsity annealing methods described in section 4.4 show improvements over a static objective function (fig. 3, fig. 5). In particular, the linear regimen improves the result by 1% for sentiment analysis, and by 7% for recall on paraphrase prediction.\nFinally, we observed that the HG-LSTM model significantly improves performance over the LSTM baseline from [27].

Moreover, HG-LSTMs with no penalties, λword = λfact = 0, yields worse results than those with penalties for the majority of the problems (17 out of 20 tasks). Our best results are achieved by using mixture of both fact detection penalisation and word sparsity (7 out of 20 task).

Future work includes investigation of this model family, which shows promise towards advancing the state of the art."

Attention-based RNN models have shown success in many difficult sequence to sequence classification problems with long and short term dependencies, however these models are prone to overfitting. In this paper, we describe how to regularize these models through an L1 penalty on the activation of the gating units, and show that this technique reduces overfitting on a variety of tasks while also providing to us a human-interpretable visualization of the inputs used by the network. These tasks include sentiment analysis, paraphrase recognition, and question answering.",
