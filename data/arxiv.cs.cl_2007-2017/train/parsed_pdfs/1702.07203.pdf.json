We show that subword-level pivot translation via a related pivot language is: (i) highly competitive with the best direct translation model and (ii) better than a pivot model which uses an unrelated pivot language, but has at its disposal large parallel corpora to build the source-pivot (S-P) and pivot-target (P-T) translation models. In contrast, pivot models trained at word and morpheme level are far inferior to their direct counterparts. We also show that using multiple related pivot languages can outperform a direct translation model. Thus, the use of subwords as translation units coupled with the use of multiple related pivot languages can compensate for the lack of a direct parallel corpus. Subword units make pivot models competitive by (i) utilizing lexical similarity to improve the underlying S-P and P-T translation models, and (ii) reducing loss of translation candidates during pivoting."

      "text" : "Related languages are those that exhibit lexical and structural similarities on account of sharing a common ancestry or being in contact for a long period of time (Bhattacharyya et al., 2016). Machine Translation between related languages is a major requirement since there is substantial government, commercial and cultural communication among people speaking related languages (Europe, India and South-East Asia being prominent examples and linguistic regions in Africa pos-\nsibly in the future). These translation requirements generally fall into the following scenarios: [A] between related languages, [B] to/from a lingua franca like English. However, most of these language pairs have few or no parallel corpora.\nWhen limited parallel corpus is available, translation using subword units like characters, orthographic syllables, etc. is useful in scenario [A] (Vilar et al., 2007; Kunchukuttan and Bhattacharyya, 2016c). This method utilizes lexical similarity between the related languages. Lexical similarity refers to sharing of many words with similar form (spelling/pronunciation) and meaning among related languages e.g. blindness is andhapana in Hindi, aandhaLepaNaa in Marathi. On the other hand, if no parallel corpus is available between two languages, pivot based SMT provides a systematic way of using a third language (called the pivot language) with which the source and target languages share parallel corpora. The general pivot based approach does not make any assumptions about relatedness between the source, pivot and target languages.\nIn this paper, we propose methods for translation involving related languages when no parallel corpus is available. For scenario [A] (translation between related languages), we utilize lexical similarity between the languages to improve pivot translation by: (i) using a pivot language that is related to source and target languages, (ii) using a subword translation unit viz. orthographic syllables (OS), (iii) identifying the pivot language based on its similarity with the source and/or target language. The contributions of our work are:\nWe show that using a pivot language related to the source and target languages along with subword level translation (with OS as translation unit) is very competitive with the best direct translation systems. Specifically, we show that our ap-\nproach:\n• significantly outperforms morpheme and word level pivot translations (about 15% and 60% increase in BLEU score respectively).\n• is competitive with a skyline OS level direct translation model (achieving about 90% of direct system’s BLEU score) and better than the corresponding word-level direct translation model.\n• is better than a word level pivot translation model which uses an unrelated pivot language and is trained on a large parallel corpus.\n• is more robust to change of translation domain as compared to word and morpheme level pivot models.\nWe show that use of multiple pivot languages can compensate for the lack of direct parallel corpora. Specifically,\n• We show that combining pivot systems using different pivot languages can outperform the best bilingual direct translation system. Thus multilinguality acts as booster to deliver the best translation results between related languages.\n• Our investigations on the choice of pivot language suggests that a pivot language closer to the target language may be preferable for better translation performance.\nTo the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work that shows that a pivot system can be very competitive with (or even outperform) a direct system (in the restricted case of related languages).\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses related work. Since we utilize lexical similarity between languages we discuss this concept in Section 3. Section 4 explains our method for translation between related languages. Section 5 describes our experimental setup.\nThe next two sections analyse the results of our experiments on pivot translation between related languages: Section 6 discusses the effect of subword units, while Section 7 discusses the effect of multiple pivot languages and factors affecting choice of pivot languages. Section 8 analyzes the results of the our initial investigations for translation between unrelated languages via a pivot which is related to either source/target (but not both) (scenario B). Finally, we summarize our work and discuss future work in Section 9."

      "text" : "Our work straddles two strands of research in statistical machine translation: (i) subwords as basic units for translation between related languages, and (ii) pivot-based machine translation.\nModeling the lexical similarity among related languages is the key to building good-quality SMT systems with limited parallel corpora. This can be achieved by subword level transformations. Lexical similarity can be modelled in the standard SMT pipeline by transliteration of words while decoding (Durrani et al., 2010) or post-processing (Nakov and Tiedemann, 2012; Kunchukuttan et al., 2014). An alternative method to improve translation quality is to use subwords as basic translation units. Subword units like character (Vilar et al., 2007; Tiedemann, 2009), character n-gram (Tiedemann and Nakov, 2013), orthographic syllables (Kunchukuttan and Bhattacharyya, 2016c) and Byte Pair Encoded units (Kunchukuttan and Bhattacharyya, 2016b) have been explored and have been shown to improve translation quality to varying degrees. We have used orthographic syllables as the basic translation unit in our experiments, since they have been shown to outperform other subword units.\nPivot translation provides a systematic way for translation between two languages through an intermediate language. Multiple approaches to pivoting have been proposed viz. (i) synthetic corpus generation (Adri‘a De Gispert, 2006) (ii) transferbased/pipelining (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007) (iii) phrase-table triangulation (Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Wu and Wang, 2007; Cohn and Lapata, 2007). We use triangulation in our experiments as it has been shown to outperform other approaches.\nIn the context of translation involving related languages, there has been some work using subword level units for pivot-based SMT. Characterbased pivot translation has been explored for one leg of the pivot system (S-P or P-T) when the pivot is related to either the source or target (but not both) (Tiedemann, 2012; Tiedemann and Nakov, 2013). In our scenario, the source, target and pivot languages are all related. Hence subword level translation is possible for both legs (source-pivot and pivot-target). Morpheme level pivot translation has been shown to be better than word level pivot translation (More et al., 2015). More et al.\n(2015) and Dabre et al. (2015) have experimented with multiple pivot languages, but the translation accuracy is lower than the direct model."

      "text" : "Two words are said to be lexically similar if they have similar form (spelling/pronunciation) and meaning e.g. time is samay in Hindi, samayam in Malayalam. These words could be cognates, lateral borrowings or loan words from other languages. Two languages are said to be lexically similar if they share a lot of lexically similar words. Lexical similarity is a key characteristic of related languages.\nEthnologue1 computes the percentage of lexical similarity between two linguistic varieties by comparing a set of standardized wordlists and counting those forms that show similarity in both form and meaning (Rensch, 1992). However, this requires extensive fieldwork and linguistic analysis.\nFor our analysis, we use a simpler measure of lexical similarity which depends on the orthography, rather than phonology. For languages which use scripts with a high grapheme-to-phoneme correspondence, this is a reasonable approach to take. We use the Longest Common Subsequence Ratio (LCSR) as a measure of lexical similarity between two strings (Melamed, 1995):\nLCSR(s1, s2) = |LCS(s1, s2)|\nmax(|s1|, |s2|) (1)\nwhere, s1, s2 are two strings and LCS is the\nlongest common subsequence between them.\nLCSR can be a versatile tool to analyze related languages and can be applied to different linguistic entities to measure their lexical similarity. In addition to its utility for measuring lexical similarity between words (Melamed, 1999; Kondrak, 2005), it can also be used to compare sentences (assuming the two sentences to be a sequence of characters). The sentences could be from the same language (e.g. reference translation and output of MT system (Tiedemann, 2012)) or different languages (e.g. parallel translations (Kunchukuttan and Bhattacharyya, 2016c)). To compute LCSR across languages, the script should be either the same or a correspondence between characters should exist. The lexical similarity between two languages can also be computed by averaging over the lexical similarities of sentence\n1 www.ethnologue.com\npairs in a parallel corpus. Table 1 shows the lexical similarities between various Indian languages which we have used in our experiments. These were computed on the multilingually aligned ILCI parallel corpus (Jha, 2012). The pairwise rankings of languages as measured by LCSR agree with the general consensus about similarity between Indian languages."

It is a linguisticallymotivated, variable-length unit which consists of a consonant core with zero or more vowels (a C+V combination) (e.g. spacious would be segmented as spa ciou s). Since the vocabulary is much smaller than the morpheme and word level models, data sparsity is not a problem. The variable length units provide appropriate context for translation between related languages.\nThis unit has outperformed character n-gram, word and morpheme level models for the task of translation between related languages. Or-\nthographic syllables outperform other units even when: (i) the languages are not very closely related (ii) the languages do not have a genetic relation, but only a contact relation.\nUsing OS level models for pivot translation ensures that the underlying S-P and P-T translation models are better than the corresponding models trained on other translation units."

Triangulation joins the two tables on the common phrases in the pivot language and recomputes the probabilities in the phrase table (direct/inverse phrase and lexical translation probabilities) by assuming a generative process and making a few independence assumptions:\nP (s̄|t̄) = ∑\np̄\nP (s̄|p̄, t̄)P (p̄|t̄) (2)\n≈ ∑\np̄\nP (s̄|p̄)P (p̄|t̄) (3)\nwhere s̄, p̄ and t̄ are source, pivot and target lan-\nguage phrases respectively\nAs compared to word and morpheme level models, OS level pivot models are likely to find more common pivot language phrases because of the smaller vocabulary size. Hence, data sparsity, a problem recognized by Dabre et al. (2015) and More et al. (2015), will be a lesser impediment to pivoting for OS level models."

The OS level models show the greatest improvement over other units when the source and target languages belong to different families, showing that OS level models can utilize the lexical similarity between these languages. Translation between agglutinative Dravidian languages also shows a major improvement.\nOS level pivot models are better than other units for two reasons. One, the underlying S-P and PT translation models are better (average 16% and 3% improvement over word and morph-level models). However, this alone does not the explain the substantial improvement in OS level pivot translation. The triangulation process, which is a join on common keys, is faced with sparsity arising from the large word and morpheme phrase-table vocabulary. The word level triangulated table actually loses translation candidates because of sparsity. On the other hand, the OS phrase table vocabulary is smaller, so the impact of sparsity is limited and the triangulated phrase table size increases by a few multiples for OS level models."

To put this fact in perspective, the BLEU scores of morph and word-level pivot systems are far below their corresponding direct systems (about 15% and 35% respectively).\nThese observations strongly suggests that pivoting at the OS level can reconstruct the direct translation system better compared to the word and morph level pivot systems, and the resultant OS level pivot systems are quite close to the best direct translation systems."

It is known that Google Translate uses English as a pivot language for many translation pairs where a direct translation corpus is not available (TAUS, 2013). For the languages we experimented with, this can be attested by the fact that English words turn up in the translations provided by Google Translate. Google Translate is presumably trained on large corpora, certainly orders of\n3 github.com/moses-smt/mgiza 4github.com/tamhd/MultiMT 5 https://translate.google.com\nmagnitude larger than our translation systems, but at the word/morpheme level.\nWe compared our pivot translation models (using a related pivot language – Telugu –, trained on tourism and health domains) with Google Translate (using an unrelated pivot – English – ) by testing on an agriculture domain test set of 1000 sentences from the ILCI corpus. This ensures a fair comparison between the two systems. Table 4 shows the Google Translate results alongside our pivot translation results. The word/morpheme level translation using an unrelated pivot and large corpora is inferior to an OS level system using a related pivot and trained on small parallel corpora.\nFor the language pairs involving mal as source language, we see that the Google Translate system produces a large number of OOVs. For the hin-mal language pair, the output of Google Translate was slightly shorter than reference translation, and the precision and recall were lower as compared to the OS-level model (as measured using METEOR)."

We see more than 1.5 BLEU point improvement over the best single pivot model. Previous studies have shown that word and morph level multiple pivot systems were not able to outperform the direct system, possibly due to the effect of sparsity on triangulation (More et al., 2015; Dabre et al., 2015). Thus, it is remarkable that multi-linguality could help overcome the lack of a direct translation system between the two languages. Once the ill-effects of data sparsity are reduced due to the use of OS level pivot, multiple pivot languages can maximize translation performance because: (i) they bring in more translation options, and (ii) they improve the estimates of feature values with evidence from multiple languages.\nWe observe that equal weighting as well as assigning interpolation weights proportional to the average lexical similarity of the pivot to source and target are the best interpolation strategies."

Thus the varied levels of sparsity induced by morphological properties dictated the choice of pivot, rather than the intrinsic properties of the pivot language. Sparsity is not a major concern with OS level models, hence we are able to study the effect of language properties on the choice of the pivot language.\nWe studied if the lexical similarity of the pivot language to the source and/or target language had\nan impact on the translation quality. We studiedmal-hin translation andmar-ben translation for multiple pivot languages. Table 8 shows the translation accuracy for different pivot languages along with lexical similarity of the pivot language to the (i) source (ii) target and (iii) average of (i) and (ii). The choice of pivot language makes a limited but observable difference (within 1 BLEU point).\nFor Marathi-Bengali translation, Hindi is the most beneficial pivot and it is most similar to the target as well as equidistant from both source and target. For Malayalam-Hindi translation, Marathi is the most useful pivot, with Gujarati close behind. Gujarati is most similar to the target as well as equidistant from both source and target. Gujarati is more similar to Marathi.\nThese observations suggest that a pivot language which is either closer to the target language or equidistant from both source and target is more useful than having a pivot which is closer to the source language. This provides further evidence to the observations by Paul et al. (2013) that target language features are more important for “coherent” language pairs."

For instance, no parallel corpus may exists for Marathi-English translation, but HindiEnglish parallel corpus may be available (Hindi and Marathi are related languages). In this case, we adopt the transfer approach to pivot translation, but the two legs of the pivot translation use different translation units. Marathi-Hindi trans-\nlation occurs at the subword level, while HindiEnglish translation occurs at the word level. In this section, we present the results of our investigations into scenario [B]. We experimented with Indian language to English and vice versa via Hindi as pivot. We trained our Hindi-English translation models on the ILCI corpus. For EnglishIndian language (IL) translation, rule-based source reordering (Ramanathan et al., 2008) was used to overcome the structural divergence between English and Indian languages (English is an SVO languages and Indian languages are SOV).\nTable 9 shows the results for the proposed approach for Indian Language-Hindi-English translation and vice versa . It also shows a comparison with word level direct translation results. For IL-hin-eng translation, the pivot system using OS model for IL-hin is better than the one using a morph model for IL-hin as well as a direct word level IL-eng translation model. However, the gains are minor compared to the gains we observed when all languages were related. For eng-hin-IL translation, using an OS level IL-hin pivot offers no advantage over a morph level ILhin pivot. Possibly, the OS model is sensitive to word order errors made by the eng-hin leg of the pivot translation.\nTo summarize, the use of OS level model as one leg of a transfer-based pivot translation has only a minor benefit for translation between unrelated languages through a pivot related to either source or pivot. Better solutions need to be investigated."

We show that pivot translation between related languages can rival or outperform direct translation if subword level translation is done using multiple related pivot languages. Subword units make this possible by using lexical similarity and reducing losses in pivoting (owing to small vocabulary).\nOur observations also hold lessons for the design of multilingual translation systems. It is better to invest in building/mining a parallel corpus through a related pivot (preferably closer to the target) than an unrelated pivot. When building translation systems between a lingua franca and an unrelated language, building/mining parallel corpora between the lingua franca and the related lan-\nguages is not the best choice. Rather, it is better to consider one of the related languages as a pivot language. These design decisions can ensure better translation accuracy with lower investment in the development of parallel corpora.\nOur results show that better methods are needed for pivot translation involving unrelated languages. The major problem current methods face is data sparsity resulting from word/morpheme level translation. Subword level translation between arbitrary languages is viable in the neural MT framework - hence, NMT may be a good research direction to tackle this translation scenario."

We show that subword-level pivot translation via a related pivot language is: (i) highly competitive with the best direct translation model and (ii) better than a pivot model which uses an unrelated pivot language, but has at its disposal large parallel corpora to build the source-pivot (S-P) and pivot-target (P-T) translation models. In contrast, pivot models trained at word and morpheme level are far inferior to their direct counterparts. We also show that using multiple related pivot languages can outperform a direct translation model. Thus, the use of subwords as translation units coupled with the use of multiple related pivot languages can compensate for the lack of a direct parallel corpus. Subword units make pivot models competitive by (i) utilizing lexical similarity to improve the underlying S-P and P-T translation models, and (ii) reducing loss of translation candidates during pivoting.",
