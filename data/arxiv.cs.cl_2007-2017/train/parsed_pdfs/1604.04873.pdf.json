      "heading" : "1 Motivation",
      "text" : "This paper proposes an approach to the segmentation of POS-tagged English sentences into minimal semantic units along with labelling of units with semantic classes (“supersenses”). Supersenses are “lightweight semantic annotation[s] of text originating in WordNet” (Schneider et al., 2012). Here, we investigate two major ideas, as follows.\nFirst, inspired by Salehi et al. (2015) we hypothesise that word embeddings (WEMBs), e.g. from word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013a), could be an extremely valuable resource of knowledge for guessing the sense of the word. WEMBs have been shown to represent distinguishable sense components learnt from large training corpora. Many papers have described experiments with word meaning extraction from word embeddings, and demonstrated that it’s possible to detect semantic relations between words based on them. Additionally, they may be used to simulate various types of relations between words with simple linear operations over word vectors, and for capturing morphological properties of words (Mikolov et al., 2013b; Vylomova et al., 2015).\nHowever, more generally, they lack any coherent sense-to-value correspondence. According to this, it’s natural to attempt to use WEMBs as a source of word meaning information in predicting the senses of semantic units, as part of the larger task of simultaneously detecting minimal semantic units and assigning them meaning. It should be noted that the general term “multiword expression” (MWE) embraces expressions of different types (Baldwin and Kim, 2010). Some of them are meaning-based and the meaning may be preserved under substitution with synonyms, e.g.; other kinds, on the other hand, are semantically idiomatic word combinations, where we would expect WEMBs to have less utility. This first approach is thus an examination of the use of WEMBs in analysing semantic units of mixed semantic compositionality.\nOur second hypothesis is that parser-based features will positively impact on the identification of MWEs. Our preliminary explorations showed that the syntactic structure of a text is closely related to the probability of an MWE occurring. For instance, in almost all cases an MWE is fully subsumed within a single clause; in the DiMSUM training set, e.g., there is just one sentence (out of 4800) where this condition is violated. Additionally, all of the components of an MWE tend to be directly connected within a dependency graph. As we observe strong correlation between the distance between two words in a parse tree and their likelihood of forming an MWE, we decided to employ parse trees as a source of features. It may be noted that we initially attempted to create a system where an MWE is treated as a special kind of clause: we modified ar X iv :1\n60 4.\n04 87\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n7 A\npr 2\nthe syntactic tree using knowledge of MWE boundaries in the training corpus and then trained a special version of the parser aware of such modified trees. That special parser version was used to directly produce MWE-labeled clauses over an arbitrary text. Although such a direct approach didn’t yield good results, we believe that directly incorporating MWE identification as part of the parsing process is a promising and fruitful direction for future work.\nIn our submission, we intentionally avoided the use of any pre-existing lexical resources, including multiword lexicons, to better focus our attention on WEMBs.\nOur source code is available at: https://github.com/andreassoftwareengineer-pro/dimsumsemeval2016."

      "heading" : "2 Overview",
      "text" : "An overall architecture of our system is shown in Figure 1. The neural network consists of three blocks: (1) an incremental vector (recurrency) calculator for a candidate MWE; (2) a two-layer perceptron for sense classification; and (3) a (somewhat wider) two-layer perceptron for MWE classification. An incremental vector produced by the first block is used as a source of feature vectors by each of the latter blocks.\nThe incremental vector calculator produces a vector vn ∈ IRDv for a n-word semantic unit expression:\nvn = tanh  Wv(Pn)× wordvec(wn)+ Wh(Pn)× hash(wn)+ Wf × wordfeat(wn)+\nWc(Pn)× {\nvn−1, n > 0 seed, n = 0\n} \nwhere Wv ∈ IRDv×M , Wh ∈ IRDh×M , Wf ∈ IRDf×M and Wc ∈ IRDc×M are parameter matrices, Dv, Dh, Df and Dc are their respective feature vector sizes, M is the incremental vector size, wn and Pn are the nth word and its part of speech, respectively, wordvec is a word embedding lookup, hash is a hash function over characters of the word (used as a means of generating embeddings for unknown words and preserve the ability to distinguish\nconcrete words), and wordfeat produces a vector of various word-wise features (see Table 2), in the spirit of approaches like Drahomı́ra johanka Spoustová et al. (2009). When calculating v1 (for a single word), an initial seed vector of parameters learnt through backpropagation is used. The motivation behind using the n = 1 stage for every MWE (rather than simply starting with n = 2 and two word vectors) is based on an intention to avoid switching between word embeddings (that play the role of features) and internally calculated vi that we expect to better capture the structure of the MWE based on the WEMBs (including following their dimension counts). Also, this technique makes the vector composition learning cycle more frequent w.r.t. the amount of training data, improving the learning rate and the final penalty. This evaluation schema is inspired by the work of Socher et al. (2011; 2010; 2014). It’s actually a recursive neural network (RNN) but, in contrast to previously used techniques, the recursion is based on candidate MWEs rather than the whole content of the sentence.\nThe incremental vector is used as an input to two two-layer perceptrons: one for MWE classification and one for one-hot sense vector learning. Back propagation processing of these two also drives the training of the incremental vector calculator, as described above.\nWe calculate distance-based features based on positions of two adjacent words in an MWE. A position here may mean a position in a sentence, in a parse tree, or, say, inside or outside a quoted phrase. The distance feature vector is supplied as input to the MWE classifier. As an alternative, it may be supplied to the incremental vector calculator input (shown by the dotted line at Figure 1, although no significant difference in performance was observed when we did this)."

In such a way, every n-word expression finally yields n− 1 incremental positive samples.\nAlso, for every word, regardless of whether it is a standalone word or a member of MWE, it learns a −1 value (i.e. a negative sample) for its (unobserved) extension to an MWE with a random word. Such a random word is chosen of the L words ahead in the same sentence, not involved in the same MWE with the current word.1\nDuring the learning process (and, correspond1We limit L to 9 words, and also limit the probability of every word selection to < 0.25 (by randomly down-weighting the sample processing for L < 4) in order to prevent possible bias to the distribution of inter-word offsets occurring while processing the last few words of a sentence. We solely pick the same sentence words as negative samples in order to make learning more focused on prediction environment patterns rather than noise, as we use a small training corpus, and at the same time to keep an approximate balance in count between negative and positive samples.\ningly, during the prediction), recursive computations of the incremental vector are solely fed by members of the same MWE, and are restarted for each semantic unit."

An inner loop iterates through (up to L) remaining words in the sentence following the current head word. Each time, a probability for such a second word to be a continuation of the MWE is evaluated. Once a new MWE or an MWE extension is predicted, it consumes the right hand word and designates it to be the next word of the MWE; the incremental vector is updated respectively with the new MWE member. Such a procedure is able to generate a deep stack of nested MWEs with gaps, but we restrict the depth to be compliant to the DiMSUM data format."

However it didn’t seem to be effective, as the number of mispredicted words was greater then the number of correctly predicted ones, in particular due to the absence of a great number of frequent words (“stop-words”) in the Google News vectors DB. Thus, a more sophisticated system would be needed if one wants to correct typos.\nOnly alphabetic characters were counted in the hash sum."

For instance, two sibling nodes have the hierarchical distance value of one. The same is also true of a phrase head word and its immediate dependent word (that case is indicated by a distinct feature). We employed TurboParser v.2.0.0 (Martins and Almeida, 2014) and trained it on a Penn TreeBank data collection (some conversion was needed to match with the part-of-speech tagset used in the DiMSUM task)."

The whole DiMSUM training\nset was used to train the system. Table 3 displays the results, measured with the DiMSUM evaluation script. Table 4 represents a brief ablation study with feature vector disabled. Word embeddings seem to be the critical source of supersense information, and they are also one of the important contributors to MWE recall. The incremental n-word vector is critical for MWE precision, and Distance features are of great importance both for precision and recall in MWE detection, but especially for the recall. Word hash and, surprisingly, heuristic word features are of much less significance than other feature vectors."

      "heading" : "7 Findings & Conclusions",
      "text" : "The system captures supersenses rather well (when we consider the large number of senses, small size of the training data, and ambiguity in the sense assignments). However, it frequently admits harsh mispredictions that are probably caused by the lack of global sense coherence in WEMBs (Qu et al., 2015). Also, it suffers from the lack of (other than MWE-related) context information in cases of ambiguity. Improving context awareness may be the most obvious next step. Unsurprisingly, the most frequent supersenses have the best recall, up to 80% for V.STATIVE. The mean recall value for senses is around 50–60%, and there are senses (like N.WEATHER) that are never correctly predicted. Exceptions are N.ATTRIBUTE, N.LOCATION, and V.CHANGE, where recall is below 30% despite them being reasonably frequent. Some of the most frequent mispredictions are the following: N.PERSON → N.GROUP; N.COMMUNICATION →\nN.ARTEFACT; N.ATTRIBUT → N.COGNITION; N.ACT → N.EVENT; and V.EMOTION → V.COGNITION.\nMWE identification looks generally reasonable for all principal types of MWEs (even, surprisingly, ones of an idiomatic nature), but the overall accuracy is low.\nHysteresis bias pattern. The MWE classifier tends to be biased toward not joining two words into a MWE3; at the same time, once an MWE is predicted, it tends to be extended excessively to include a third and subsequent words, often selecting a nonrelevant word with some gap.4 This probably means that the proposed sampling schema is not balanced enough to work for small amounts of training data.\nLookahead. The method obviously lacks the ability to model context when predicting MWEs. In cases of expressions like John , Mary & Company, for example, our system will predict John Mary Company with all the punctuation missing. Some bidirectional, attentional (Bahdanau et al., 2014; Cohn et al., 2016) or lookahead-based approach is needed, as we may not have a reasonable isolated rule for whether John should be joined to the comma. A similar situation may also occur in punctuation-less contexts.\nParsing. The use of parsing results in markedly better precision and recall. Taking into account the strong correlation between parser-based features and MWE boundaries, further investigation of the parser-based approach is warranted.\n3An example from the DiMSUM test data: English speaking advisor produces an MWE predicted to be English advisor (not including speaking\n4As a very rough compensation of such an effect, one may use two confidence levels, one (negative) at n = 2, another (positive) at n ≥ 3.\nMultiword-to-Sense Collision. A shared nword incremental vector computation both for MWE and sense learning imposes a collision. It may be observed that for better MWE training, the distance features should be supplied to the computation input (as shown with the dotted line in Figure 1), but this will decreases the sense prediction score.\nNeeds a deeper network. The training dynamics observed in the experiments show that the neural networks (especially the one used for MWE prediction) need to be deeper (use more than two layers, as suggested in Sutskever et al. (2014))."
