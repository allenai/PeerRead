      "text" : "Human computer conversation is regarded as one of the most difficult problems in artificial intelligence. In this paper, we address one of its key sub-problems, referred to as short text conversation, in which given a message from human, the computer returns a reasonable response to the message. We leverage the vast amount of short conversation data available on social media to study the issue. We propose formalizing short text conversation as a search problem at the first step, and employing state-of-the-art information retrieval (IR) techniques to carry out the task. We investigate the significance as well as the limitation of the IR approach. Our experiments demonstrate that the retrieval-based model can make the system behave rather “intelligently”, when combined with a huge repository of conversation data from social media.\nKeywords: Short Text Conversation, Information Retrieval, Learning to Rank, Learning to Match"

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Human computer conversation is one of the most challenging AI problems, which involves language understanding, reasoning, and use of common sense knowledge. Despite a significant amount of effort on the research in the past decades, the progress on the problem is unfortunately quite limited. One of the major reasons for that is lack of large volumes of real conversation data (Chen et al., 2011; Nouri et al., 2011).\nIn this paper, we consider a much simplified version of the problem: one round of conversation formed by two short texts, with the former being a message from human and the latter being a response to the message from the computer. We refer to it as short text conversation (STC). Thanks to the extremely large amount of short text conversation data available on social media such as Twitter1 and Weibo2, we anticipate that significant progress could be made in the research on the problem with the use of the big data, much like what has happened in machine translation, community question answering, etc.\nModeling a short text conversation is much simpler than modeling a complete dialogue, which often requires several rounds of interactions (e.g., a dialogue system as in Litman et al. (2000)). However, it can shed important light on understanding of the complicated mechanism of natural language dialogues and can significantly enhance the research toward the ultimate goal of passing the Turing test. The research on the problem will instantly help applications such as chatbot at a web site, automatic short-message reply on mobile phone, and voice assistant like Siri3. With the emergence of social media, as well as the spread of mobile devices, conversation via short texts has become an important way of communication for people in our time.\nIThis paper is an extended version of Wang et al. (2013) with the following new content: (1) empirical verification of effectiveness of several new matching models including translation model and deep matching model, and (2) proposal of topic-word model. ∗Corresponding author. Email addresses: jizongcheng@gmail.com (Zongcheng Ji), lu.zhengdong@huawei.com (Zhengdong Lu), hangli.hl@huawei.com (Hang Li) 1http://twitter.com/ 2http://weibo.com/ 3http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri\nar X\niv :1\n40 8.\n69 88\nv1 [\ncs .I\nR ]\n2 9\nA ug\n2 01\n4\nOne simple approach to STC, and perhaps the first approach which one would want to try, is to take it as an information retrieval (IR) problem, maintain a large repository of short text conversation data, and develop a conversation system mainly based on IR technologies. Given a message, the system retrieves related responses from the repository and returns the most reasonable response. That is to say, we would not generate a new response, but select the most suitable response (originally made to other messages) as reply to the current message. We refer to the former approach as generation-based STC and the latter approach as retrieval-based STC. With advanced IR technologies and a dataset with previously unthinkable volume, we would expect that the conversation system can behave almost like a human in each round of conversation.\nRetrieval-based STC is similar to some IR tasks such as community question answering (CQA). In the former task, each instance consists of a message-response pair (or a post-comment pair in social media), while in the latter task, each instance consists of a question-answer pair. The differences are also evident, however. The messages tend to be longer than the responses in STC, while the answers tend to be longer than the questions in CQA. More importantly, the relations between texts are different in the two problems. The answers in CQA must be solutions to the questions, which mostly involves knowledge, while the responses in STC need only be explanations, opinions, or criticisms on the messages, which is more about appropriateness or human-likeness.\nIn this paper, we try to answer the question of to what extent the IR approach can effectively manipulate STC. We first propose a framework, which employs a learning to rank method for training of the ranking model and matching models as features of the ranking model. The matching models include (1) basic matching models based on cosine similarities, (2) translation model, (3) latent space model (linear model), (4) deep matching model (non-linear), and (5) topic-word model. The latent space model and deep matching model are techniques recently developed for search and question answering, and the topic-word model is devised for STC in this paper. We then conduct large scale experiments with a dataset from Weibo, which we have created and released for research on STC. Our experiments show that the retrieval-based approach can achieve fairly good performance with the precision at position one being 0.64. Experiments also show that all the matching models can significantly improve the performance. We also conduct case study to show the significance and limitation of the IR approach.\nThe contributions of this paper, which is an extension of our previous paper (Wang et al., 2013), include (1) proposal of the IR approach to STC, (2) empirical verification of effectiveness and restriction of the approach, (3) proposal of topic-word model for STC, and (4) development of public dataset for the research.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related work. Section 3 shows an example of conversation on Weibo. Section 4 gives the definition of retrieval-based STC and a three-stage retrieval based framework to perform STC. Section 5 and section 6 give details on the dataset and the matching features used in the framework. Section 7 and 8 describe the experimental results and case studies, respectively. Finally, the work is concluded and future research directions are identified in Section 9."

      "text" : "Early work on modeling dialogues is either rule-based (Weizenbaum, 1966) or learning-based (Litman et al., 2000; Schatzmann et al., 2006; Williams and Young, 2007). These approaches require no data (e.g., rule based) or little data (e.g., reinforcement learning based) for training, but much manual effort in building the model, which is usually very costly. Furthermore, the coverage of the systems is also not satisfactory.\nAn alternative approach is to build a dialogue system with a knowledge base consisting of large number of question-answer pairs. For example, the system in Leuski et al. (2006) and Leuski and Traum (2011) selects the most suitable response to the current message from the question-answer pairs using a statistical language model in cross-lingual information retrieval. The major bottleneck of this approach is creation of the knowledge base (i.e., question-answer pairs). Instead of building knowledge base by hand, Chen et al. (2011) and Nouri et al. (2011) propose augmenting a knowledge base with question-answer pairs derived from texts using a question generation tool. The results show that the augmented system can answer questions about new topics, with certain performance drop on questions about existing topics. The number of question-answer pairs obtained in this way is still small (a few thousands). Furthermore, the statistical language model can only match questions and answers at the word level, not at the semantic level, which may hinder the performance of the system.\nAll the above systems work at small scale in the sense that they can only respond to a small variety of messages. Recently, with the fast development of social media, such as community question answering and microblog services, a very large amount of conversation data becomes available. Ritter et al. (2011) investigate the feasibility of conducting short text conversation by using statistical machine translation (SMT) techniques, as well as millions of naturally occurring conversation data in Twitter. The results show that phrase-based SMT (Koehn et al., 2007) works better than vector space model (VSM) (Salton et al., 1975) in IR in terms of BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002). In the approach, a response is generated from a model, not retrieved from a repository, and thus it cannot be guaranteed to be a legitimate natural language text.\nIn this paper, we conduct short text conversation (STC) by leveraging the state-of-the-art IR technologies and the vast amount of conversation data on social media. A related but slightly different problem has been studied in Jafarpour et al. (2010), as an initial step for building a chatbot, referred to as learning to chat (L2C). L2C attempts to perform human computer conversation by utilizing machine learning and large scale dialogue data (each instance consists of several rounds of conversation). Their method first filters and then ranks responses to find the best candidate, on the basis of all information in the context. It is, thus, not directly comparable with our method in this paper."

Given a query, documents containing the query terms are first retrieved from the index. Matching between the query and each of the documents is then carried out using different models such as traditional IR model of BM25 (Robertson et al., 1995), translation model (Berger and Lafferty, 1999), and latent space model (Wu et al., 2013). The matching scores of each document are taken as features of the document. Next, the documents are assigned scores by the ranking model on the basis of their features. Finally, the documents are sorted by their ranking scores. The ranking model is trained in advance using learning to rank, and the matching models are trained in advance using semantic matching techniques (or in general learning to match). In this paper, we employ the IR techniques for short text conversation."

      "text" : "Weibo is a microblog service in China, similar to Twitter, on which a user can publish a short message (referred to as post in the remainder of the paper) visible to the public or a group of users following her/him. Just like Twitter, Weibo also has the length limit of 140 Chinese characters on each post. Users can attach a short message to a published post, with the same length limit, referred to as comment in this paper. Figure 1 shows an example of post and associated comments (in Chinese).\nWe argue that the post-comment pairs on Weibo provide a rather valuable resource for studying short text conversation between users. The comments to a post can be of flexible forms and diverse topics, as illustrated in the example\nin Table 1. With a post being a report about the user’s current status (travelling to Hawaii), the comments can be a question about the user’s future status, a request to the user, a greeting to the user, and so on, but are apparently all appropriate.\nIn many cases, the post-comment pair is self-contained, which means that one does not need any background knowledge and context information to understand the conversation (Examples of that include the comments of users B, D, G and H). In some cases, one may need extra knowledge and information to understand the conversation. For example, the comment of user E will be fairly elusive if taken out of the context that A’s Hawaii trip is for an international conference and he is going to give a talk there. We argue that the number of self-contained postcomment pairs is vast, and therefore the collected post-comment pairs can serve as a rich resource for exploring rather sophisticated patterns and structures of natural language conversations."

The statistics of the dataset are summarized in Table 2."
    }, {
      "heading" : "5.2. Labeled Post-Comment Pairs",
      "text" : "This subsection introduces the creation process of the labeled post-comment pairs, which are used for training and testing different retrieval models for STC.\nWe employ a pooling strategy widely used in information retrieval for getting the instances to label (Voorhees, 2002). More specifically, for a given query, we use each of three basic retrieval models to select top 10 comments (see Section 6.1 for the description of the basic matching models), and merge them to form a much reduced candidate set with size ≤ 30. Then we assign the comments in the reduced candidate set into “suitable” and “unsuitable” categories. Basically we consider a comment suitable for a given query if we cannot tell whether it is an original comment. More specifically the suitability of a comment is judged based on the following three criteria7:\n• Semantic Relevance: This requires the content of the comment to be semantically relevant to the post. As shown in the example right below, the query is about soccer, and so is comment 1, and hence it is semantically relevant, whereas comment 2 is about food and hence semantically irrelevant.\nQuery 英格兰禁区里老是八个人. . . . . . There are always 8 English players in their own penalty area. Unbelievable!\nComment 1 哈哈哈仍然是0：0。还没看到进球。 Haha, it is still 0:0, no goal so far. Comment 2 英格兰的食物真可怕! The food in England is horrible.\nAnother important aspect of semantic relevance is entity association. This requires that the entities in the comment to be strongly associated with those in the query. In other words, if the query is about entity A, while\n7Note that although our criteria in general favor short and general comments like “说得很好！(Well said!)” or “太好了！(Nice!)”, most of the general comments have already been filtered out due to their lengths (see Section 5.1.2).\nthe comment is about entity B, they are very likely to be mismatched. As shown in the following example, where the query is about Paris, while comment 2 talks about London:\nQuery 巴黎的天空！暖暖的太阳+阵阵的微风，真让人不舍得离开。 The sky in Paris! Warm sun + bursts of breeze. Really hate to leave.\nComment 1 好好享受你在巴黎的时间吧。 Enjoy your time in Paris.\nComment 2 我希望我现在在伦敦。 Man, I wish I am in London right now.\nThis is however not absolute, since a comment containing a different entity could still be sound, as demonstrated by the following two comments to the query above:\nComment 1 好好享受你在法国的时间吧。 Enjoy your time in France.\nComment 2 伦敦的秋天也很漂亮。 The fall of London is nice too.\n• Logic Consistency: This requires the content of the comment to be logically consistent with the query. For example, in the table right below, the query states that the Huawei mobile phone “Honor” is already in the market of mainland China. Comment 1 talks about a personal preference over the same phone model (hence logically consistent), whereas comment 2 asks a question to which the answer is already clear from the query (hence logically inconsistent).\nQuery 华为荣耀手机在中国大陆大卖！ HUAWEI’s mobile phone, Honor, sells well in mainland China.\nComment 1 华为荣耀手机是我最喜欢的一款手机。 HUAWEI Honor is my favorite phone\nComment 2 华为荣耀手机什么时候会在中国大陆上市？ When will HUAWEI Honor get to the market in mainland China?\n• Speech Act Agreement: Another important factor in determining the suitability of a comment is speech act. For example, when a question is posed in the Weibo post, a certain act (e.g., answering or forwarding it) is expected. In the example below, the query asks a special question about location. Comment 1 forwards and comments 2 answers the question, whereas comment 3 is an imperative sentence and therefore does not correspond well in speech act.\nQuery 有人知道后年的KDD会在哪里举行呢？ Any one knows where KDD will be held the year after next?\nComment 1 同问。希望在欧洲 co-ask. Hopefully Europe\nComment 2 听说在纽约 New York, as I heard Comment 3 请帮忙扩散这条关于KDD的信息。 Please help me distribute the information of KDD.\nFinally, we manually label 422 queries and their associated comments, about 30 comments for each post. Note that (1) the labeling is only on a small subset of the 38,016 posts, and (2) for each selected (query) post, the labeled comments are not originally given to it. The statistics of this part of dataset are also summarized in Table 2."

Although it is not necessarily true that a good response has many common words as the query, but this measurement is often helpful in finding relevant responses. For example, when the query and the candidate response both have “National Palace Museum in Taipei”, it is a strong signal that they are about similar topics. Unlike other semantic matching features, this simple similarity requires no learning and works on infrequent words. Our empirical results show that it can often capture the query-response relation which semantic matching features cannot."

Our experiments (see Table 14) indicate that this simple linear model can learn meaningful semantic matching patterns, due to its effective use of massive data. For example, the image of the word “Italy” in the post in the latent space matches well the words “Sicily”, “Mediterranean sea” and “travel”. Once the mapping Lq and Lr are learned, the semantic matching score qTLqLTr r will be utilized as a feature for modeling the overall suitability of r as a response to q."

Table 3 shows a real example of the lexical gap problem. Two candidate responses are suitable to the query, while their ranking is very low in the top 30 candidates.

To bridge the lexical gap between queries and candidate post-comment pairs, the two translation models allow a post and its response translate any one of their words t to a different but semantically related query word w with a non-zero probability. α is the Jelinek-Mercer smoothing factor (Zhai and Lafferty, 2001). β is the interpolation parameter between the post model and the response model. γ is the parameter to balance between the unigram language model and the translation model for alleviating the lexical gap problem and the self-translation problem (Xue et al., 2008).\nThe main difference between our TransLM for retrieval-based STC and that for question retrieval in Community Question Answering (CQA) (Xue et al., 2008) is that we add an additional part ∑ t∈r T (w|t)Pml(t|r) in the response part while Xue et al. (2008) does not do that in the answer part. The reasons are two-fold: (1) we focus on finding suitable responses given a query while Xue et al.

There are two different settings of source and target for constructing the parallel corpus: (1) set the posts as the source and the responses as the target, i.e., collection (p, r)1, ..., (p, r)n, and (2) set the responses as the source and the posts as the target, i.e., collection (r, p)1, ..., (r, p)n. Following Xue et al. (2008), a pooling strategy is adopted to combine the above two collections of pairs to get a pooled collection (p, r)1, ..., (p, r)n, (r, p)1, ..., (r, p)n. Moreover, we also filter low-frequency words, whose frequency is less than 10."

We propose employing a new deep neural network model, referred to it as deep matching model (DeepMatch) in the paper, to model the complicated matching relations between query and candidate response in retrieval-based STC.9 This new architecture is mainly based on the following two intuitions:\n• Localness: There are salient local structures in the semantic space of parallel texts to be matched, which can be roughly captured by the co-occurrence pattern of words. This localness however should not prevent two “distant” components from correlating with each other on a higher level, hence call for the hierarchical characteristic of the model;\n• Hierarchy: The decision making for matching has different levels of abstraction. The local decisions, capturing the interactions between semantically related words, will be combined later layer-by-layer to form the final and global decision on matching."

Suppose that we are given the following triples (x, y+, y−) from the oracle, with x (∈ X) matched with y+ better than with y− (both ∈ Y). The ranking-based objective is defined as follows\nL(W,Dtrn) = ∑\n(xi,y+i ,y − i )∈Dtrn\neW(xi, y+i , y − i ) + R(W), (11)\nwhere R(W) is the regularization term and eW(xi, y+i , y−i ) is the error for triple (xi, y+i , y−i ), given by the following large margin form:\nei = eW(xi, y+i , y − i ) = max(0,m + s(xi, y − i ) − s(xi, y+i )),\nwith parameter 0 < m controlling the margin.

They do not capture the matching relations between the main topics of the query and the response. Table 4 shows a real example of the problem. The top 2 candidate responses are unsuitable to the query, while the first suitable response is ranked at 9. The main reason is that the word “菜鸟(rookie)” has higher term frequencies in the query and the unsuitable responses, and thus dominates their matching scores. However, the main topics of the query is not “菜鸟(rookie)” but “代码控制工具(code control tool) SVN GIT”, and thus the top 2 candidate responses are not suitable. One possible solution is to identify the topic words of the query and the candidate responses and give higher weights to the matching of the topic words. This may alleviate the topic mismatch problem and improve the performance of STC. In Table 4, the topic words of the query and the candidate responses are shown in bold. After identifying the topic words, the first two responses clearly become unsuitable to the query, while the third response having the same topic becomes suitable.\nOne key question is how to differentiate topic words from the other words in a short text. We propose a method for the task in the following subsections."

We refer to the words as topic words. Examples are show in Table 4. In this paper, we employ a probabilistic approach based on logistic regression to compute the probability of a word being the topic word of a short text. In the logistic regression model, we specifically compute P(topic|w) as follows, where w denotes a word and topic denotes a binary variable representing whether or not w is a topic word.\nlog (\nP(topic|w) 1 − P(topic|w)\n) = ~ω · ~x + c (12)\nP(topic|w) = e ~ω·~x+c\n1 + e~ω·~x+c (13)\nwhere ~x is a short text, such as a post or a comment in Weibo, represented as a vector of features, ~ω is a vector of weights associated with the features, and c is a constant.\nIn the logistic regression model we make use of the features, as listed in Table 5. The first two features (TF, IDF) are from the traditional term weighting schemes in information retrieval. The third feature (SF) is based on the observation that words appearing in multiple sentences in the short text are more likely to be topic words. The next two features (First, Last) represent the positions of word in the short text. Our observation is that topic words are most likely to appear in the first or the last sentence. The next three features (NE, NE First, NE Last) are named entity related features. The last feature (POS) is the part of speech of a word, which is based on the fact that topic words are usually denoted by nouns and verbs.\nTo create the training data, we randomly select 200 short texts (including posts and comments) to label their topic words. We make labeling judgments on all words in a short text (except some stop words), as our model is applied to words. Each word is assigned to one of the two classes, “positive” class and “negative” class, depending on whether or not it is a topic word. The judgments are made based on the principle that the topic words of a short text should be indicative to the main theme of the short text. Finally, we obtain 2,008 words for the 200 short texts. Table 6 summarizes the statistics of the dataset and Table 7 lists the topic word distributions over word positions, parts of speech and named entities in the dataset. As shown in Table 7, topic words are typically nouns in the first sentence of a short text.\nWe use ICTCLAS (Zhang et al., 2003) to obtain the part of speech and named entity information and LIBLINEAR (Fan et al., 2008) to build the logistic regression model and predict the probability of a word being a topic word.

In this paper, we consider a much simplified version of the problem: one round of conversation formed by two short texts, with the former being a message from human and the latter being a response to the message from the computer. We refer to it as short text conversation (STC). Thanks to the extremely large amount of short text conversation data available on social media such as Twitter1 and Weibo2, we anticipate that significant progress could be made in the research on the problem with the use of the big data, much like what has happened in machine translation, community question answering, etc. Modeling a short text conversation is much simpler than modeling a complete dialogue, which often requires several rounds of interactions (e.g., a dialogue system as in Litman et al.

In this paper, we address one of its key sub-problems, referred to as short text conversation, in which given a message from human, the computer returns a reasonable response to the message. We leverage the vast amount of short conversation data available on social media to study the issue. We propose formalizing short text conversation as a search problem at the first step, and employing state-of-the-art information retrieval (IR) techniques to carry out the task. We investigate the significance as well as the limitation of the IR approach. Our experiments demonstrate that the retrieval-based model can make the system behave rather “intelligently”, when combined with a huge repository of conversation data from social media.",
