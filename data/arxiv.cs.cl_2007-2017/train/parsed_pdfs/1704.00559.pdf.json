      "text" : "In many natural language processing tasks, we will require a down-stream system to consume the input of an up-stream system, such as word segmenters, part of speech taggers, or automatic speech recognizers. Among these, one of the most prototypical and widely used examples is speech translation, where a down-stream translation system must consume the output of an up-stream automatic speech recognition (ASR) system.\nPrevious research on traditional phrase-based or tree-based statistical machine translation have used word lattices (e.g. Figure 1) as an effective tool to pass on uncertainties from a previous step\n0: <s>\n1: ah 5: qué 8: </s>\n2: hay 4: qué\n3: que\n6: bueno\n7: bueno\n(Ney, 1999; Casacuberta et al., 2004). Several works have shown quality improvements by translating lattices, compared to translating only the single best upstream output. Examples include translating lattice representations of ASR output (Saleem et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2005; Matusov et al., 2008), multiple word segmentations, and morphological alternatives (Dyer et al., 2008).\nRecently, neural sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015) have often been preferred over the traditional methods for their strong empirical results and appealing end-to-end modeling. These models force us to rethink approaches to handling lattices, because their recurrent design no longer allows for efficient lattice decoding using dynamic programming as was used in the earlier works.\nAs a remedy, Su et al. (2016) proposed replacing the sequential encoder by a lattice encoder to obtain a lattice-to-sequence (lat2seq) model. This is achieved by extending the encoder’s Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) (Cho et al., 2014) to be conditioned on multiple predecessor paths. The authors demonstrate improvements in Chineseto-English translation by translating lattices that combine the output of multiple word segmenters, rather than a single segmented sequence.\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n00 55\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 3\nA pr\n2 01\n7\nHowever, this model does not address one aspect of lattices that we argue is critical to obtaining good translation results: their ability to encode the certainty or uncertainty of the paths through the use of posterior scores. Specifically, we postulate that these scores are essential for tasks that require handling lattices with a considerable amount of erroneous content, such as those produced by ASR systems. In this paper, we propose a lattice-tosequence model that accounts for this uncertainty. Specifically, our contributions are as follows:\n• We employ the popular child-sum TreeLSTM (Tai et al., 2015) to derive a lattice encoder that replaces the sequential encoder in an attentional encoder-decoder model. We show empirically that this approach yields only minor improvements compared to a baseline that is fine-tuned on sequential recognition outputs. This finding stands in contrast to the positive results by Su et al. (2016), as well as by Ladhak et al. (2016) on a lattice classification task, and suggests higher learning complexity of our speech translation task.\n• We hypothesize that lattice scores are crucial in aiding training and inference, and propose several techniques for integrating lattice scores into the model: (1) We compute weighted child-sums,1 where hidden units in the lattice encoder are conditioned on their predecessor hidden units such that predecessors with low probability are less influential on the current hidden state. (2) We bias the TreeLSTM’s forget gates for each incoming connection toward being more forgetful for predecessors with low probability, such that their cell states become relatively less influential. (3) We bias the attention mechanism to put more focus on source embeddings belonging to nodes with high lattice scores. We demonstrate empirically that the third proposed technique is particularly effective and produces strong gains over the baseline. According to our knowledge, this is the first attempt of integrating lattice scores at the training stage of a machine translation model.\n• We exploit the fact that our lattice encoder is a strict generalization of a sequential encoder by pre-training on sequential data, ob-\n1This is reminiscent of the weighted pooling strategy by Ladhak et al. (2016) for spoken utterance classification.\ntaining faster and better training convergence on large corpora of parallel sequential data.\nWe conduct experiments on the Fisher and Callhome Spanish–English Speech Translation Corpus (Post et al., 2013) and report improvements of 1.4 BLEU points on Fisher and 0.8 BLEU points on Callhome, compared to a strong baseline optimized for translating 1-best ASR outputs. We find that the proposed integration of lattice scores is crucial for achieving these improvements."

The conditional probability p(y | x) is estimated using parameters trained on a parallel corpus, e.g. of sentences in the source and target language in a translation task. This probability is factorized as the product of conditional probabilities of each token to be generated:\np(y | x) = M∏ t=1 p(yt | y<t,x).\nTraining is performed in an end-to-end fashion. The training objective is to estimate parameters θ that maximize the log-likelihood of the sentence pairs in a given parallel training set D:\nJ(θ) = ∑\n(x,y)∈D\nlog p(y | x; θ)."

In contrast, hidden states in LSTMs and other sequential RNNs are conditioned on only one predecessor state (h̃j in left column of Table 1), rendering standard RNNs unsuitable for the modeling of lattices. Luckily Tai et al. (2015)’s TreeLSTM, which was designed to compose encodings in trees, is also straightforward to apply to lattices; the TreeLSTM composes multiple child states into a parent state, which can also be applied to lattices to compose multiple predecessor states into a successor state. Table 1, middle column, shows the TreeLSTM in its child-sum variant that supports an arbitrary number of predecessors. Conditioning on multiple predecessor hidden states is achieved by simply taking their sum as h̃i. Cell states from multi-\n2It is perhaps more common to think of each edge representing a word, but we will motivate why we instead assign word labels to nodes in Section 3.3.\n<s> ah hay que qué qué bueno bueno </s>\nple predecessor are each passed through their own forget gates fjk and then summed.\nEncoding a lattice results in one hidden state for each lattice node. Our lat2seq framework uses this network as encoder, computing the attention over all lattice nodes.3 In other words we replace (1) by the following:\n−→ h i = LatticeLSTM ( xi, { −→ h k | k∈C(i)} ) (4)\nSimilarly, we encode the lattice in backward direction and replace (2) accordingly. Figure 2 illustrates the result. The computational complexity of the encoder is O(|V | + |E|), i.e. linear in the number of nodes plus number of edges in the graph. The complexity of the attention mechanism is O(|V |M), where M is the output sequence length. |V | depends on both the expected input sentence length and the lattice density."

(2016) who assign word labels to edges. Recurrent states in edge-labeled lattice encoders are conditioned not only on multiple predecessor states, but must also aggregate words from multiple incoming edges. This implies that hidden units may represent more than one word in the lattice. Moreover, in the edge-labeled case hidden units that are in the same position in forward and backward encoders represent different words, but are nevertheless concatenated and attended to jointly. For these reasons we find our approach of encoding word-labeled lattices more\n3This is similar in spirit to Eriguchi et al.

These lattice scores assign different probabilities to competing paths, and are often provided by up-stream statistical models. For example, an ASR may attach posterior probabilities that capture acoustic evidence and linguistic plausibility of words in the lattice. In this section, we describe our method, first explaining how we normalize scores to a format that is easily usable in our method, then presenting our methods for incorporating these scores into our encoder calculations."

Here, outgoing edges sum up to one, as illustrated by the left-most scores in Figure 3. However, in some of our methods it will be necessary that scores be normalized in the backward direction, so that the weights from incoming connections sum up to one, or globally normalized, so that the probability of the node is the marginal probability of all the paths containing that node.\nLetwf ,i,wm,i,wb,i denote forward-normalized, marginal, and backward-normalized scores for node i respectively, illustrated in Figure 3. Given wf ,i, we can compute marginal probabilities recur-\nsively as\nwm,i = ∑\nk∈C(i)\nwm,k·wf ,i\nby using the forward algorithm (Rabiner, 1989). Then, we can normalize backward using\nwb,i = wm,i∑\nk∈C′(i)wm,k ,\nwhere C ′(i) denotes the successors of node i. All 3 forms are employed in the sections below.\nFurthermore, when integrating these scores into the lat2seq framework, it is desirable to maintain flexibility over how strongly they should impact the model. For this purpose, we introduce a peakiness coefficient S. Given a lattice score wb,i in backward direction, we compute wSb,i/Zi. Zi= ∑ k∈C(i)wk is a re-normalization term to ensure that incoming connections still sum up to one. In the forward direction, we compute wSf,i/Zi and normalize analogously over outgoing connections. Setting S=0 amounts to ignoring the scores by flattening their distribution, while letting S→∞ puts emphasis solely on the strongest nodes. S can be optimized jointly with the other model parameters via back-propagation during model training."

      "heading" : "4.2 Integration Approaches",
      "text" : "We suggest three methods to integrate these scores into our lat2seq model, with equations shown in\nthe right column of Table 1. These methods can optionally be combined, and we conduct an ablation study to assess the effectivity of each method in isolation (§5.3).\nThe first method consists of computing a weighted child-sum (WCS), using lattice scores as weights when composing the hidden state h̃i. This is based on the intuition that predecessor hidden states with high lattice weights should have a higher influence on their successor than states with low weights. The precise formulas for WCS are shown in (5).\nThe second method biases the forget gate fik for each predecessor cell state such that predecessors with high lattice score are more likely to pass through the forget gate (BFG). The intuition for this is similar to WCS; the composed cell state is more highly influenced by cell states from predecessors with high lattice score. BFG is implemented by introducing a bias term inside the sigmoid as in (6).\nIn the cases of both WCS and BFG, all hidden units have their own independent peakiness. Thus Sh and Sf are vectors, applied elementwise after broadcasting the lattice score. The renormalization terms Zh,k and Zf,k are also vectors and are applied element-wise. We use backwardnormalized scores wb,i for the forward-directed encoder, and forward-normalized scores wf ,i for the backward-directed encoder.\nIn the third and final method, we bias the attentional weights (BATT) to put more focus on lattice nodes with high lattice scores. This can potentially mitigate the problem of having multiple contradicting lattice nodes that may confuse the attentional decoder. BATT is computed by introducing a bias term to the attention as in (7). Attentional weights are scalars, so here the peakiness Sa is also a scalar. We drop the normalization term, relying instead on the softmax normalization. Both BFG and BATT use the logarithm of lattice scores so that values will still be in the probability domain after the softmax or sigmoid is computed."

      "text" : "Finally, to reduce the computational burden, we perform a two-step training process where the model is first pre-trained on sequential data, then fine-tuned on lattice data. The pre-training, like standard training for neural machine translation (NMT), allows for efficient training using minibatches, and also allows for training on standard text corpora for which we might not have lattices available. The fine-tuning is then performed on parallel data with lattices on the source side. This is much slower4 than the pre-training because the network structure changes from sentence to sentence, preventing us from using efficient minibatched calculations. However, fine-tuning for only a small number of iterations is generally sufficient, as the model is already relatively accurate in the first place. In practice we found it important to use minibatches when fine-tuning, accumulating gradients over several examples before performing parameter updates. This provided negligible speedups but greatly improved optimization stability.\nAt test time, the model is able to translate both sequential and lattice inputs and can therefore be used even in cases where no lattices are available, at potentially diminished accuracy."

Decoding time was only slightly increased by a factor of 1.2 when using lattice inputs.\n(Post et al., 2013). This is a corpus of Spanish telephone conversations that includes automatic transcripts and lattices. The Fisher portion consists of telephone conversations between strangers, while the Callhome portion contains telephone conversations between relatives or friends. The training data size is 138,819 sentences (Fisher/Train), and 15,000 sentences (Callhome/Train). Heldout testing data is shown in Table 2. ASR word error rates (WER) are relatively high, due to the spontaneous speaking style and challenging acoustic conditions. Lattice contain on average 3.4 (Fisher/Train) or 4.5 (Callhome/Train) times more words than their corresponding reference transcripts.\nFor preprocessing, we tokenized and lowercased source and target sides. We removed punctuation from the reference transcripts on the source side for consistency with the automatic transcripts and lattices. All models are pre-trained and finetuned on Fisher/Train unless otherwise noted. Our source-side vocabulary contains all words from the automatic transcripts for Fisher/Train, replacing singletons by an unknown word token, totaling 14,648 words. Similarly, on the target side we used all words from the reference translations of Fisher/Train, replacing singletons by the unknown word, yielding 10,800 words in total.\nOur implementation is based on lamtram (Neubig, 2015) and DyNet (Neubig et al., 2017). We use the implemented attentional model with default parameters: a layer size of 256 per encoder direction and 512 for the decoder, word embedding size of 512. We used 2 encoder and decoder layers for better baseline performance. For the sequential baselines, the LSTM variant in the left column of Table 1 was employed. Forget gates were initialized to 1, following Jozefowicz et al.

We halve the learning rate when the dev perplexity (on Fisher/Dev) gets worse. Pre-training and fine-tuning on 1-best sequences is performed until convergence, and training on lattices is performed for 2 epochs to keep experimental effort manageable. On Fisher/Train, this took 3-4 days on a fast CPU.5 Minibatch size was 1000 words for pre-training, and 20 sentences for lattice training. Unless otherwise noted, peakiness coefficients were jointly optimized during training.

At test time, we try references, lattice oracles,6 1-best transcripts, and lattices as inputs to all 4 systems. The former 2 experiments give upper bounds on achievable translation accuracy, while the latter 2 correspond to a realistic setting. Table 3 shows the results on Fisher/Dev2 and Fisher/Test.\nBefore even considering lattices, we can see that 1-best fine-tuning boosted BLEU scores quite impressively (1-best/R vs. 1-best/R+1), with gains of 1.3 and 0.7 BLEU points. This stands in contrast to Post et al. (2013) who find the 1-best transcripts not to be helpful for training a hierarchical machine translation system. Possible explanations are learning from repeating error patterns, and improved robustness to erroneous inputs. On top of these gains, our proposed set-up (lattice/R+L+S) improve BLEU scores by another 1.4. Removing the lattice scores (lattice/R+L) diminishes the results and performs worse than the 1-best baseline (1-best/R+1), indicating that the proposed lattice score integration is crucial for good performance. This demonstrates a clear advantage of our proposed method over that of Su et al. (2016).\n5For comparison, we tried training on lattices from scratch, which took 9 days (6 epochs) to converge at a dev perplexity that was 10% worse than with the pre-training plus fine-tuning strategy.\n6The path through the lattice with the best WER.\nAs can be seen in the table, models finetuned on lattices show reasonable performance for both lattice and sequential inputs (1-best/R+L, lattice/R+L, 1-best/R+L+S, lattice/R+L+S). This is not surprising, given that the lattice training data includes lattices of varying density, including lattices with very few paths or even only one path. On the other hand, without fine-tuning on lattices, using lattices as input performs poorly (lattice/R and lattice/R+1). A closer look revealed that translations were often too long, potentially because implicitly learned mechanisms for length control were not ready to handle lattice inputs.\nTable 3 reports perplexities for Fisher/Dev2. Unlike the corresponding BLEU scores, the lattice encoder appears stronger than the 1-best baseline in terms of perplexity even without lattice scores (lattice/R+L vs. 1-best/R+1). To understand this better, we computed the average entropy of the decoder softmax, a measure of how much confusion there is in the decoder predictions, independent of whether it selects the correct answer or not. Over the first 100 sentences, this value was 2.24 for 1-best/R+1, 2.39 for lattice/R+L, and 2.15 for lattice/R+L+S. This indicates that the decoder is more confused for lattices without scores, while integrating lattice scores removes this problem. These numbers also suggest that it may be possible to obtain further gains using methods that stabilize the decoder."

Table 4 shows the results. Overall, joint training of S gives similar results as fixing S=1, but both clearly outperform fixing S=0. Removing confidences (setting S=0) in one place at a time reveals that the attention mechanism is clearly the most important point of integration, while gains from the integration into child-sum and forget gate are smaller and not always consistent.\nWe also analyzed what peakiness values were actually learned. We found that all 3 models that we trained for the averaging purposes converged to Sa=0.62. Sh and Sf had per-vector means\nbetween 0.92 and 1.0, at standard deviations between 0.02 and 0.04.

A possible explanation is the added context helping the lat2seq system to know when to be unsure.\n1-best/R+1 input: sı́ sı́ bueno contar otro que usaban los teléfonos satélite los los móviles no funcionaban bien porque pero a veces si funcionaban sı́\n1-best/R+1 output: yes , well , tell me that i used to use satellite phones , the kids didn ’t work well , because sometimes it worked , yes\nlattice/R+L+S input:\nno … los … los móviles\nlattice/R+L+S output: yes , yes , well , with the other that i used to use the satellite phones , the , the 〈unk〉 didn ’t work well because , but sometimes it worked , yes\nA.4 Counter Example In this example, the lattice (but not the 1-best transcript) contained then word ”san”, which tricked the lat2seq decoder to produce ”san francisco”.\n1-best/R+1 input: pero los demás aquı́ están también sı́ está bien está tranquilo para acá\n1-best/R+1 output: but the rest here are also , yes , it ’s ok , it ’s quiet for here\nlattice/R+L+S input:\ntambién …\nen … san\nestán …\ntambién\nsí\nlattice/R+L+S output: but the rest here in san francisco is very quiet here"

Possible explanations are learning from repeating error patterns, and improved robustness to erroneous inputs. On top of these gains, our proposed set-up (lattice/R+L+S) improve BLEU scores by another 1.4. Removing the lattice scores (lattice/R+L) diminishes the results and performs worse than the 1-best baseline (1-best/R+1), indicating that the proposed lattice score integration is crucial for good performance. This demonstrates a clear advantage of our proposed method over that of Su et al. (2016).",

These up-stream models are potentially error-prone. Representing inputs through word lattices allows making this uncertainty explicit by capturing alternative sequences and their posterior probabilities in a compact form. In this work, we extend the TreeLSTM (Tai et al., 2015) into a LatticeLSTM that is able to consume word lattices, and can be used as encoder in an attentional encoderdecoder model. We integrate lattice posterior scores into this architecture by extending the TreeLSTM’s child-sum and forget gates and introducing a bias term into the attention mechanism. We experiment with speech translation lattices and report consistent improvements over baselines that translate either the 1-best hypothesis or the lattice without posterior scores.",
