      "text" : "Computing the probability of a formula given the probabilities or weights associated with other formulas is a natural extension of logical inference to the probabilistic setting. Surprisingly, this problem has received little attention in the literature to date, particularly considering that it includes many standard inference problems as special cases. In this paper, we propose two algorithms for this problem: formula decomposition and conditioning, which is an exact method, and formula importance sampling, which is an approximate method. The latter is, to our knowledge, the first application of model counting to approximate probabilistic inference. Unlike conventional variable-based algorithms, our algorithms work in the dual realm of logical formulas. Theoretically, we show that our algorithms can greatly improve efficiency by exploiting the structural information in the formulas. Empirically, we show that they are indeed quite powerful, often achieving substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art schemes."

      "text" : "The standard task in the field of automated reasoning is to determine whether a set of logical formulas (the knowledge base KB) entails a query formula Q. (The formulas could be propositional or first-order; in this paper we focus on the propositional case.) Logic’s lack of a representation for uncertainty severely hinders its ability to model real applications, and thus many methods for adding probability to it have been proposed. One of the earliest is Nilsson’s probabilistic logic (Nilsson, 1986), which attaches probabilities to the formulas in the KB and uses these to compute the probability of the query formula. One problem with this approach is that the formula probabilities may be inconsistent, yielding no solution, but consistency can be verified\nand enforced (Nilsson, 1986). Another problem is that in general a set of formula probabilities does not completely specify a distribution, but this is naturally solved by assuming the maximum entropy distribution consistent with the specified probabilities (Nilsson, 1986; Pietra et al., 1997).\nA more serious problem is the lack of efficient inference procedures for probabilistic logic. This contrasts with the large literature on inference for graphical models, which always specify unique and consistent distributions (Pearl, 1988). However, the representational flexibility and compactness of logic is highly desirable, particularly for modeling complex domains. This issue has gained prominence in the field of statistical relational learning (SRL) (Getoor and Taskar, 2007), which seeks to learn models with both logical and probabilistic aspects. For example, Markov logic represents knowledge as a set of weighted formulas, which define a log-linear model (Domingos and Lowd, 2009). Formulas with probabilities with the maximum entropy assumption and weighted formulas are equivalent; the problem of converting the former to the latter is equivalent to the problem of learning the maximum likelihood weights (Pietra et al., 1997). In this paper we assume weighted formulas, but our algorithms are applicable to formulas with probabilities by first performing this conversion.\nAnother reason to seek efficient inference procedures for probabilistic logic is that inference in graphical models can be reduced to it (Park, 2002). Standard inference schemes for graphical models such as junction trees (Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988) and bucket elimination (Dechter, 1999) have complexity exponential in the treewidth of the model, making them impractical for complex domains. However, treewidth can be overcome by exploiting structural properties like determinism (Chavira and Darwiche, 2008) and context-specific independence (Boutilier, 1996). Several highly efficient algorithms accomplish this by encoding a graphical models as sets of weighted formulas and applying logical inference techniques to them (Sang et al., 2005; Chavira and Darwiche, 2008).\nAll of these algorithms are variable-based, in that they explore the search space defined by truth assignments to the\nvariables. In this paper, we propose a new class of algorithms that explore the search space defined by truth assignments to arbitrary formulas, including but not necessarily those contained in the original specification. Our formula-based schemes generalize variable-based schemes because a variable is a special case of a formula, namely a unit clause. For deriving exact answers, we propose to exhaustively search the space of truth assignments to formulas, yielding the formula decomposition and conditioning (FDC) scheme. FDC performs AND/OR search (Dechter and Mateescu, 2007) or recursive conditioning (Darwiche, 2001), with and without caching, over the space of formulas, utilizing several Boolean constraint propagation and pruning techniques.\nEven with these techniques, large complex domains will still generally require approximate inference. For this, we propose to compute an importance distribution over the formulas, yielding formula importance sampling (FIS). Each sample in FIS is a truth assignment to a set of formulas. To compute the importance weight of each such sampled assignment, we need to know its model count (or number of solutions). These model counts can either be computed exactly, if it is feasible, or approximately using the recently introduced approximate model counters such as SampleCount (Gomes et al., 2007) and SampleSearch (Gogate and Dechter, 2007b). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that harnesses the power of model counting for approximate probabilistic inference. We prove that if the model counts can be computed accurately, formula importance sampling will have smaller variance than variablebased importance sampling and thus should be preferred.\nWe present experimental results on three classes of benchmark problems: random Markov networks, QMR-DT networks from the medical diagnosis domain and Markov logic networks. Our experiments show that as the number of variables in the formulas increases, formula-based schemes not only dominate their variable based counterparts but also state-of-the-art exact algorithms such as ACE (Chavira and Darwiche, 2008) and approximate schemes such as MC-SAT (Poon and Domingos, 2006) and Gibbs sampling (Geman and Geman, 1984).\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes background. Section 3 presents formula decomposition and conditioning. Section 4 presents formula importance sampling. Experimental results are presented in Section 5 and we conclude in Section 6."

Let F be a propositional formula over X.\nA model or a solution of F is a 0/1 truth assignment to all variables in X such that F evaluates to True. We will assume throughout that F is in CNF, namely it is a conjunction of clauses, a clause being a disjunction of literals. A literal is a variableXi or its negation ¬Xi. A unit clause is a clause with one literal. Propositional Satisfiability or SAT is the decision problem of determining whether F has any models. This is the canonical NP-complete problem. Model Counting is the problem of determining the number of models of F , it is a #P-complete problem.\nWe will denote formulas by letters F , G, and H , the set of solutions of F by Sol(F ) and its number of solutions by #(F ). Variables are denoted by letters X and Y . We denote sets by bold capital letters e.g., X, Y etc. Given a set X = {X1, . . . , Xn} of variables, x denotes a truth assignment (x1, . . . , xn), where Xi is assigned the value xi. Clauses are denoted by the letters C, R, S and T . Discrete functions are denoted by small Greek letters, e.g. φ, ψ, etc. The variables involved in a function φ, namely the scope of φ is denoted by V (φ). Similarly, the variables of a clauseC are denoted by V (C). Given an assignment x to a superset X of Y, xY denotes the restriction of x to Y.\nThe expected value of a random variable X with respect to a distribution Q is EQ[X ] = ∑ x∈X xQ(x). The variance\nof x is V arQ[X ] = ∑ x∈X(x− EQ[X ]) 2Q(x).\nIn this paper, we advocate using a collection of weighted propositional formulas instead of the conventional tabular representations to encode the potentials in Markov random fields (MRFs) or conditional probability tables in Bayesian networks. Specifically, we will use the following representation, which we call as propositional MRF or PropMRF in short. A PropMRF is a Markov logic network (Richardson and Domingos, 2006) in which all formulas are propositional. It is known that any discrete Markov random field or a Bayesian network can be encoded as a PropMRF (Park, 2002; Sang et al., 2005; Chavira and Darwiche, 2008).\nDEFINITION 1 (Propositional MRFs). A propositional MRF (PropMRF), denoted by M is a triple (X,C,R) where X is a set of n Boolean variables, C = {(C1, w1), . . . , (Cm, wm)} is a set of m soft (weighted) clauses and R = {R1, . . . , Rp} is a set of p hard clauses. Each soft clause is a pair (Ci, wi) where Ci is a clause and wi is a real number. We will denote byFM = R1∧. . .∧Rp, the CNF formula defined by the hard clauses of M. The primal graph of a PropMRF has variables as its vertices and an edge between any two nodes that are involved in the same hard or soft clause.\nWe can associate a discrete function φi with each soft clause (Ci, wi), defined as follows:\nφi(xV (Ci)) = { exp(wi) If x evaluates Ci to True 1 Otherwise\nThe probability distribution associated with M is given by:\nPM(x) = { 1 ZM ∏m i=1 φi(xV (φi)) If x ∈ Sol(FM)\n0 Otherwise (1)\nwhere ZM is the normalization constant; often referred to as the partition function. ZM is given by:\nZM = ∑\nx∈Sol(FM)\nm∏\ni=1\nφi(xV (φi)) (2)\nNote that if M has no soft clauses, then ZM equals the number of models of the formula FM. Thus, model counting is a special case of computing ZM.\nWe will focus on the query of finding the probability of a CNF formula G, denoted by P (G). By definition:\nP (G) = ∑\nx∈Sol(FM∧G)\nPM(x)\n= 1\nZ\n∑\nx∈Sol(FM∧G)\nm∏\ni=1\nφi(xV (φi)) (3)\nIf we add all the clauses of G to the hard clauses of M yielding another PropMRFM′, then the partition function ZM′ of M′ is given by:\nZM′ = ∑\nx∈Sol(FM∧G)\nm∏\ni=1\nφi(xV (φi)) (4)\nFrom Equations 3 and 4, we get P (G) = ZM′ ZM\n. Because computing P (G) is equivalent to computing a ratio of two partition functions, in the sequel, we will present formulabased algorithms for computing ZM only."

      "heading" : "3 Exact Formula-based Inference",
      "text" : "We first explain how to perform inference by variablebased conditioning and then show how it can be generalized via formula-based conditioning. Consider the expression for ZM (See Equation 2). Given assignments Xj and ¬Xj , we can express ZM as:\nZM = ∑\nx∈Sol(FM∧Xj)\nm∏\ni=1\nφi(xV (φi))\n+ ∑\nx∈Sol(FM∧¬Xj)\nm∏\ni=1\nφi(xV (φi)) (5)\n= ZMXj + ZM¬Xj (6)\nwhere MX and M¬X are PropMRFs obtained by adding X and ¬X to the set of hard clauses of M respectively.\nThen, one can perform conditioning to computeZMXj and ZM¬Xj , recursively for each PropMRF until all variables\nin X have been instantiated. Conditioning by itself is not that useful. For example, if the PropMRF has no hard clauses, then conditioning would perform 2n summations. However, one can augment it with various simplification schemes such as Boolean constraint propagation, and utilize problem decomposition, yielding powerful schemes in practice. These and other ideas form the backbone of many state-of-the-art schemes such as ACE (Chavira and Darwiche, 2008) and Cachet (Sang et al., 2005). To simplify a PropMRF, we can apply any parsimonious operators - operators which do not change its partition function. In particular, we can remove all clauses which evaluate to True from the set of hard clauses. These clauses are redundant. Examples of operations that aid in identifying such hard clauses are unit propagation, resolution and subsumption elimination. For example, given a hard clause A, the hard clause A ∨ B is redundant and can be removed because it is subsumed within A. Similarly, A could be removed after unit propagation, because it always evaluates to True. We can simplify the soft clauses based on the hard clauses by removing all soft clauses which evaluate to either True or False, multiplying the partition function with an appropriate constant to account for their removal. For example, given a hard clause A, the soft clause A∨B having weight w is always satisfied and can be removed, by multiplying the partition function by exp(w)1.\nAnother advancement that we can use is problem decomposition (Darwiche, 2001; Dechter and Mateescu, 2007). The idea here is that if the soft and hard clauses of a PropMRF can be partitioned into k > 1 sets such that any two clauses in any of the k sets have no variables in com-\n1Note that if we remove a variable that is not a unit clause from all the hard and soft clauses, then we have to multiply the partition function by 2.\nmon, then the partition function equals the product of the partition functions of the k PropMRFs induced by each set.\nThe following example demonstrates simplification and decomposition on an example PropMRF.\nEXAMPLE 1. Consider the PropMRF shown in Figure 1. After conditioning on A and simplifying using Boolean constraint propagation, we get two PropMRFs shown under the True (left) and false (right) branches of A in Figure 2. The PropMRF at the True branch contains only two soft clauses which have no variables in common. Thus, they could be decomposed into two PropMRFs as shown. The contribution to the partition function due to the True branch of A is then simply a product of the partition functions of the two PropMRFs and exp(w1 + w2)× 22.\nOur main observation is that we can condition on arbitrary formulas instead of variables. Formally, given an arbitrary formula Hj , we can express ZM as:\nZM = ∑\nx∈Sol(FM∧Hj)\nm∏\ni=1\nφi(xV (φi))\n+ ∑\nx∈Sol(FM∧¬Hj)\nm∏\ni=1\nφi(xV (φi)) (7)\n= ZMHj + ZM¬Hj (8)\nWhen combined with Boolean constraint propagation and problem decomposition, this seemingly simple idea is quite powerful because it can yield a smaller search space, as we demonstrate in the following example. In some cases, these reductions could be significant.\nEXAMPLE 2. Consider again the PropMRF shown in Figure 1. The first two clauses share a sub-clause A ∨B ∨ C. If we condition first onA∨B ∨C, we get the search space shown in Figure 3, which has only 7 leaf nodes. One can\nAlgorithm 1: Formula Decomposition and Conditioning (FDC) Input: A PropMRFM Output: ZM begin\nw = 0; 1.

(This search space is not shown because of lack of space. It can be worked out using Figure 2.)\nAlgorithm Formula Decomposition and Conditioning (FDC) is presented as Algorithm 1. It takes as input a PropMRF M. The first step is the simplification step in which we reduce the size of the hard and the soft clauses using techniques such as unit propagation, resolution and subsumption elimination. In the decomposition step (Step 2), we decompose M into independent PropMRFs if its primal graph is decomposable. Each of them are then solved independently. Note that this is a very important step and is the primary reason for efficiency of techniques such as recursive conditioning (Darwiche, 2001) and AND/OR search (Dechter and Mateescu, 2007). In fact, the whole idea in performing simplification and heuristic conditioning is to split the PropMRF into several PropMRF’s that can be solved independently. Finally, in the conditioning step, we heuristically select a formula R to condition on and then recurse on the true and the false assignments to R.\nWe summarize the dominance of FDC over VDC (where VDC is same as FDC except that we condition only on unit clauses in Step 3) in the following proposition.\nPROPOSITION 1. Given a PropMRF M, let SM,F and SM,V be the number of nodes in the smallest search space explored by FDC and VDC respectively. Then SM,F ≤ SM,V . Sometimes, this inequality can be strict.\nImprovements\nWe consider two important improvements. First, note that if we are not careful, the algorithm as presented may yield a super-exponential search space. For example, if we condition on a set of arbitrary formulas, none of which simplify the PropMRF, we may end up conditioning on a super-exponential number of formulas. Trivially, to guarantee at least an exponential search space in the size of the clausal specification, the formula selected for conditioning must reduce/simplify at least one soft clause or at least one hard clause. Second, we can augment FDC with component caching and clause learning as in Cachet (Sang et al., 2005) and use w-cutset conditioning (Dechter, 1999) in a straight forward manner. We omit the details."

FDC also generalizes weighted model counting (WMC) approaches such as ACE (Chavira and Darwiche, 2008) and Cachet (Sang et al., 2005). These weighted model counting approaches introduce additional Boolean variables to model each soft clause. Conditioning on these Boolean variables is equivalent to conditioning on the soft clauses present in the PropMRF. Thus, FDC can simulate WMC by restricting its conditioning to not only the unit clauses but also the soft clauses already present in the PropMRF. Finally, FDC is related to streamlined constraint reasoning (SCR) approach of (Gomes and Sellmann, 2004). The idea in SCR is to add a set of streamlining formulas to the input formula in order to cut down the size of its solution space in a controlled manner. The goal of streamlining is solving a Boolean Satisfiability (or a Constraint Satisfaction) problem while FDC uses (streamlined) formulas for weighted model counting."

First, the importance distribution U(h) may suffer from the rejection problem (Gogate and Dechter, 2007a) in that we may generate truth assignments (to clauses) which are inconsistent, namely their model count is zero. Note that this could happen even if there are no hard clauses in M because the formula combinations considered may be inconsistent. Fortunately, if we ensure that U(h) = 0 whenever h is inconsistent, namely make U(h) backtrack-free (Gogate and Dechter, 2007a), we can avoid this problem altogether.

ACE, FDC and VDC use the same clausal representation while VE uses tabular representation. Note that the domains are deliberately chosen to elucidate the properties of FDC, in particular, to verify our intuition that as size of the clauses increases, FDC is likely to dominate VDC.\nWe implemented FDC and VDC on top of RELSAT (Roberto J. Bayardo Jr. and Pehoushek, 2000), which is a SAT model counting algorithm. As mentioned earlier, after conditioning on a formula, we use various Boolean\npropagation, pruning techniques such as unit propagation, clause learning, subsumption elimination and resolution. Also, similar to Cachet (Sang et al., 2005), we use component caching and similar to w-cutset conditioning (Dechter, 1999), we invoke bucket elimination at a node if the treewidth of the (remaining) PropMRF at the node is less than 16.\nSince FDC is a DPLL-style backtracking search scheme, its performance is highly dependent upon a good branching heuristic (that selects the next clause to condition on). In our implementation, we used a simple dynamic heuristic of conditioning on the largest sub-clause (unit clause in case of VDC) that is common to most hard and soft clauses, ties broken arbitrarily. The main intuition for this heuristic is that branching on the largest common sub-clause would cause the most propagation, yielding the most reduction in the search space size. We also tried a few other heuristics, both static and dynamic, such as (i) conditioning on a subclause C (and its negation) that causes the most unit propa-\ngations (but one has to perform unit propagations for each candidate clause, which can be quite expensive in practice) (ii) graph partitioning heuristics based on the min-fill, mindegree and hmetis orderings; these heuristics are used by solvers such as ACE (Chavira and Darwiche, 2008) and AND/OR search (Dechter and Mateescu, 2007) and (iii) Entropy-based heuristics.

The diseases for each symptom are chosen randomly.\nA QMR-DT problem (d, f, s) is designated as d− f − s in Table 1. We can see that as the size of the clauses increases,\nFDC performs better than VDC. FDC also dominates ACE as the problem size increases."

      "text" : "Our final domain is that of relational networks. We experimented with the Friends and Smokers networks and the Entity resolution networks.\nIn the friends and smokers networks (FS), we have three first order predicates smokes(x), which indicates whether a person smokes, cancer(x), which indicates whether a person has cancer, and friends(x, y), which indicates who are friends of whom. The probabilistic model is defined by assigning weights to two logical constraints, friends(x, y) ∧ smokes(x) ⇒ smokes(y) and smokes(x) ⇒ cancer(x). Given a domain for x and y, a PropMRF can be generated from these two logical constraints by considering all possible groundings of each predicate. We experimented with different domain sizes for x and y ranging from 25 to 34. From Table 1, we can see that the time required by FDC is almost the same as VDC. This is because the size of the clauses is small (≤ 3). ACE dominates both FDC and VDC.\nEntity resolution is the problem of determining which observations correspond to the same entity. In our experiments, we consider the problem of matching citations of scientific papers. We used the CORA Markov logic network given in the Alchemy tutorial (Kok et al., 2004). This MLN has ten predicates such as Author(bib, author), T itle(bib, title), SameAuthor(author, author), SameT itle(title, title) etc. and clauses ranging from size 2 to 6. The clauses express relationship such as: if two fields have high similarity, then they are (probably) the same; if two records are the same, their fields are the same, and vice-versa; etc. We experimented with domain sizes of 2 and 3 for each of the 5 first-order variables present in the domain. The problems are denoted as cora2 and cora3 respectively. From Table 1, we can see that FDC is the only algorithm capable of solving the largest instance."

      "text" : "We compared “Formula importance sampling (FIS)” against “Variable importance sampling (VIS)” and stateof-the-art schemes such as MC-SAT (Poon and Domingos, 2006) and Gibbs sampling available in Alchemy (Kok et al., 2004) on the three domains described above. For both VIS and FIS, we chose to construct the importance distribution Q from the output of a Belief propagation scheme (BP), because BP was shown to yield a better importance function than other approaches in previous studies (Yuan and Druzdzel, 2006; Gogate and Dechter, 2005).\nWe describe next, how the method described in (Gogate\nand Dechter, 2005) can be adapted to construct an importance distribution over formulas. Here, we first run BP (or Generalized Belief Propagation (Yedidia et al., 2004)) over a factor (or region) graph in which the nodes are the variables and the factors are the hard and the soft clauses. Let (C1, . . . , Cm) be an ordering over the soft clauses. Given a truth assignment to the first i − 1 soft clauses ci−1 = (c1, . . . , ci−1), we computeU(Ci|ci−1) as follows. We first simplify the formula F = FM ∧ Fci−1 , possibly deriving new unit clauses. Let φCi be the marginal distribution at the factor corresponding to the clause Ci in the output of BP. Then, U(Ci|ci−1) is given by:\nU(Ci = True|ci−1) ∝ ∑\ny∈φCi\nIF,Ci(y)φCi(y) (15)\nwhere IF,Ci(y) = 1 if y evaluates Ci to True but does not violate any unit clause in F , and 0 otherwise. Note that the importance distribution Q over the variables is a special case of the scheme described above in which we construct a distribution over all the unit clauses.\nWe implemented Algorithm 2 as follows. Notice that the algorithm requires a SAT solver and a model counter. We used Minisat (Sorensson and Een, 2005) as our SAT solver. For model counting, we use the RELSAT model counter whenever exact counting was feasible2 and the approximate solver SampleSearch (Gogate and Dechter, 2007b) whenever it wasn’t.\nWe measure the performance of the sampling schemes using the sum Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the exact and the approximate posterior marginals for each variable given evidence. Time versus sum KLD plots for two representative problems from each domain are shown in Figures 4, 5 and 6. We can clearly see that as the size of the clauses increases, FIS outperforms VIS, MC-SAT and Gibbs sampling."

      "text" : "In this paper, we introduced a new formula-based approach for performing exact and approximate inference in graphical models. Formula-based inference is attractive because: (a) it generalizes standard variable-based inference, (b) it yields several new efficient algorithms that are not possible by reasoning just over the variables and (c) it fits naturally within the recent research efforts in combining logical and probabilistic Artificial Intelligence.\nOur empirical evaluation shows that formula-based approach is especially suitable for domains having large clauses. Such clauses are one of the main reasons for using logic instead of tables for representing potentials or\n2Exact counting was invoked if the number of variables was less than 100, which was the case for most networks that we experimented with, except the relational benchmarks.\nCPTs in graphical models. In particular, conventional tabular representations require space exponential in the number of variables in the scope of the potential, while if the potential can be summarized using a constant number of clauses, we only require linear space. Since an efficient inference scheme is one of the main bottleneck in learning PropMRFs having large clauses, we believe that our formula-based approach to inference can lead to new structure and weight learning schemes that learn large weighted clauses from data.\nOur work can be extended in several ways. In particular, we envision formula-based versions of various inference schemes such as variable elimination, belief propagation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. One of these schemes, namely formula elimination trivially follows from this work, as it is known that conditioning works along the reverse direction of elimination (Dechter, 1999). Also, we envision the development of lifted versions of all the formula-based schemes proposed in this paper."

Surprisingly, this problem has received little attention in the literature to date, particularly considering that it includes many standard inference problems as special cases. In this paper, we propose two algorithms for this problem: formula decomposition and conditioning, which is an exact method, and formula importance sampling, which is an approximate method. The latter is, to our knowledge, the first application of model counting to approximate probabilistic inference. Unlike conventional variable-based algorithms, our algorithms work in the dual realm of logical formulas. Theoretically, we show that our algorithms can greatly improve efficiency by exploiting the structural information in the formulas. Empirically, we show that they are indeed quite powerful, often achieving substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art schemes.",
