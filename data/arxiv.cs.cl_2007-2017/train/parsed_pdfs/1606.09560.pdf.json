      "text" : "We present a simple neural network for word alignment that builds source and target word window representations to compute alignment scores for sentence pairs. To enable unsupervised training, we use an aggregation operation that summarizes the alignment scores for a given target word. A soft-margin objective increases scores for true target words while decreasing scores for target words that are not present. Compared to the popular Fast Align model, our approach improves alignment accuracy by 7 AER on EnglishCzech, by 6 AER on Romanian-English and by 1.7 AER on English-French alignment."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Word alignment is the task of finding the correspondence between source and target words in a pair of sentences that are translations of each other. Generative models for this task (Brown et al., 1990; Och and Ney, 2003; Vogel et al., 1996) still form the basis for many machine translation systems (Koehn et al., 2003; Chiang, 2007).\nRecent neural approaches include Yang et al. (2013) who introduce a feed-forward networkbased model trained on alignments that were generated by a traditional generative model. This treats potentially erroneous alignments as supervision. Tamura et al. (2014) sidesteps this issue by negative sampling to train a recurrent-neural network on unlabeled data. They optimize a global loss that requires an expensive beam search to approximate the sum over all alignments.\n†This work was conducted while the first author did an internship at Facebook AI Research.\nIn this paper we introduce a word alignment model that is simpler in structure and which relies on a more tractable training procedure. Our model is a neural network that extracts context information from source and target sentences and then computes simple dot products to estimate alignment links. Our objective function is wordfactored and does not require the expensive computation associated with global loss functions. The model can be easily trained on unlabeled data via a novel but simple aggregation operation which has been successfully applied in the computer vision literature (Pinheiro and Collobert, 2015). The aggregation combines the scores of all source words for a particular target word and promotes source words which are likely to be aligned with a given target word according to the knowledge the model has learned so far. At test time, the aggregation operation is removed and source words are aligned to target words by choosing the highest scoring candidates (§2, §3).\nWe evaluate several forms for our aggregation operation such as computing the sum, max and LogSumExp over alignment scores. Results on English-French, English-Romanian, and CzechEnglish alignment show that our model significantly outperforms Fast Align, a popular loglinear reparameterization of IBM Model 2 (Dyer et al., 2013; §4)."

Words are represented by fj and ei, which are indices in source and target dictionaries. For simplicity, we assume here that word indices are the only feature fed to our architecture. Given a source word fj and a target word ei, our architecture embeds a window (of size d f win\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n09 56\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 3\n0 Ju\nn 20\n16\nand dewin, respectively) centered around each of these words into a demb-dimensional vector space.

      "text" : "In this paper, we consider an unsupervised setup where the alignment is not known at training time. We thus cannot minimize or maximize matching scores (1) in a direct manner. Instead, given a target word ei we consider the aggregated matching scores over the source sentence:\nsaggr(i, f) = |f |\nAggr j=1 s(i, j) , (2)\nwhere Aggr is an aggregation operator (§2.2). Consider a matching (positive) sentence pair (e+, f) and a negative sentence pair (e−, f). Given a word at index i+ in the positive target sentence, we want to maximize the aggregated score saggr(i+, f) (1 ≤ i+ ≤ |e+|) because we know it should be aligned to at least one source word.1 Conversely, given a word at index i− in the negative target sentence, we want to minimize saggr(i\n−, f) (1 ≤ i− ≤ |e−|) because it is unlikely that the source sentence can explain the negative target word. Following these principles, we consider a simple soft-margin loss:\nL(e+, e−, f) = |e+|∑ i+=1 log(1 + e−saggr(i +,f))\n+ |e−|∑ i−=1 log(1 + e+saggr(i −,f)) .\n(3)\nTraining is achieved by minimizing (3) and by sampling over triplets (e+, e−, f) from the training data.\n1We discuss how we handle unaligned target words in §2.3. Also, depending on the decoding algorithm the model can be used to predict many-to-many alignments."

If we had the word alignments, then we would sum over the source words fj aligned with ei. However, in our setup alignments are not available at training time, so we must rely on what the model has learned so far to filter the source words. We consider the following strategies:\n• Sum: ignore the knowledge learned so far, and assign the same weight to all source words fj to explain ei.2 In this case, we have\nsaggr(i, f) = |f|∑ j=1 s(i, j) .\n• Max: encourage the best aligned source word fj , according to what the model has learned so far. In this case, the aggregation is written as:\nsaggr(i, f) = |f|\nmax j=1 s(i, j) .\n• LSE: give similar weights to source words with similar scores. This can be achieved with a LogSumExp aggregation operation (also called LogAdd), and is defined as:\nsaggr(i, f) = 1\nr log  |f|∑ j=1 er s(i, j)  , (4) where r is a positive scalar (to be chosen) controlling the smoothness of the aggregation.

This feature can be computed for a target word ei and a source word fj :\ndiag(i, j) = ∣∣∣∣ i|e| − j|f | ∣∣∣∣ ,\nThis feature allows the model to learn that aligned sentence pairs use roughly the same word order and that alignment links remain close to the diagonal. We use this feature only for the source network because it encodes relative position information which only needs to be encoded once. If we would use absolute position instead, then we would need to encode this information both on the source and the target side.\nPart-of-speech Words pairs that are good translations of each other are likely to carry the same part of speech in both languages (Melamed, 1995).

For LSE, we set r = 1 in (4).\nWe initialize the word embeddings with a simple PCA computed over the matrix of word cooccurrence counts (Lebret and Collobert, 2014). The co-occurrence counts were computed over the common crawl corpus provided by WMT16. For part of speech tagging we used the Stanford parser on English-French data, and MarMoT (Mueller et al., 2013) for Romanian-English as well as English-Czech.\nWe trained 4 systems for the ensembles, each using a different random seed to vary the weight initialization as well as the shuffling of the training set. We averaged the alignment scores predicted by each system before decoding. The alignment threshold variables µ−(ei) and σ−(ei) for decoding (§2.3) were estimated on 1000 random training sentences, using 100 negative sentences for each of them.

For instance, a common mistake would be to align ”the cat sat”, with ”PADDING le chat”. To prevent such behavior, we occasionally replaced the center word in a target window by a random word during training.
