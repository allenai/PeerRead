      "text" : "Character-level models are attracting increasing interest. We group them into three classes. (i) Character-level models of words derive a word representation from the character string, but they are symbolic in that they need text segmented into tokens as input. (ii) Bag-of-ngram models discard the order of character ngrams on the assumption that relevant order information is coded in the ngrams, so the order of ngrams can be neglected. (iii) End-to-end models learn a separate model on the raw character (or byte) input for each task; these models estimate task-specific parameters, but no representation of text that would be usable across tasks is computed.\nTurning to group (iii) first, one premise of this paper is that text representations are needed in NLP. A large body of work on the use of word embeddings like SENNA (Collobert et al., 2011), word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013), HLBL (Mnih and Hinton, 2009) and GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) demonstrates that a generic text representation, trained in an unsupervised fashion on large corpora, is useful for many\nNLP applications. Thus, we take the view that radical end-to-end learning is not a good approach for NLP.\nIn this paper, we separate training and utilization of the text representation model. We use “training” to refer to the method by which the model is learned and “utilization” to refer to the application of the model to a piece of text to compute a representation of the text. In many text representation models, utilization is trivial. For example, for word embedding models, utilization amounts to a simple lookup of a word to get its precomputed embedding. However, for the models we consider, utilization is not trivial and we will discuss different approaches.\nBoth training and utilization can be either symbolic or nonsymbolic. We define a symbolic approach as one that is based on tokenization, i.e., a segmentation of the text into tokens. Symbol identifiers (i.e., tokens) can have internal structure, e.g., if a tokenizer recognizes tokens like “to and fro” and “London-based” that contain delimiters or if a token is morphologically analyzed downstream.1\nWe define a nonsymbolic approach as one that is tokenization-free, i.e., no assumption is made that there are segmentation boundaries and that each segment (e.g., a word) should be represented (e.g., by a word embedding) in a way that is independent of the representations (e.g., word embeddings) of neighboring segments.\nMethods for training text representation models that require tokenized text include word embedding models like SENNA, HLBL, Word2vec and GloVe and character-level models like fast-\n1Some define symbols as identifiers that have no internal structure, but uses of the term that allow for the possibility of internal structure are also frequent. For example, the Wikipedia entry for “symbol” states: “Numerals are symbols for numbers.” Most numerals have internal structure.\nText skipgram (Bojanowski et al., 2016). Examples of nonsymbolic text representation utilization models are bag-of-ngram models that compute the representation of a text as the sum of the embeddings of all character ngrams occurring in it, e.g., CHARAGRAM (Wieting et al., 2016)). CHARAGRAM is an example of a mixed trainingutilization model: training requires tokenized text (words and phrases), utilization is nonsymbolic. The model is trained on words and phrases, i.e., tokens that are the output of tokenization, but it can be applied to any untokenized character sequence.\nWe make two contributions in this paper. First, we propose the first generic method for training a text representation model without the need for tokenization and address the challenging sparseness issues that make this a difficult problem. Second, we propose the first nonsymbolic utilization method that fully represents sequence information – in contrast to utilization methods like bag-ofngrams that discard sequence information that is not directly encoded in the character ngrams themselves.\nWe show that our models perform better than prior work on an information extraction and a text denoising task."

      "heading" : "2 Motivation for nonsymbolic representation",
      "text" : "Chung et al. (2016) discuss two main motivations for their work on character-level models. First, segmentation/tokenization algorithms make many mistakes and are brittle: “we do not have a perfect word segmentation algorithm for any one language”. Tokenization errors then propagate throughout the NLP pipeline, potentially doing great damage.\nSecond, there is currently no general solution for morphology in statistical NLP. For many languages, high-coverage and high-quality morphological resources are not available. Even for well resourced languages, problems like ambiguity make morphological processing difficult; e.g., “rung” is either the singular of a noun meaning “part of a ladder” or the past participle of “to ring”. In many languages, e.g., in German, syncretism, a particular type of systematic morphological ambiguity, is pervasive. Thus, there is no simple morphological processing method that would produce a representation in which all inflected forms of “to ring” are marked as having a common lemma;\nand no such method in which an unseen form like “aromatizing” is reliably analyzed as a form of “aromatize” whereas an unseen form like “antitrafficking” is reliably analyzed as the compound “anti+trafficking”.\nOf course, it is an open question whether nonsymbolic methods can perform better than morphological analysis, but the foregoing discussion motivates us to investigate them.\nChung et al. (2016) focus on problems with processing the tokens that are output by text segmentation algorithms. Equally important is the problem that tokenization fails to capture structure across multiple tokens. The job of dealing with multi-token structure is often given to downstream components of the pipeline, e.g., components that recognize multiwords and named entitites in English or in fact any word in a language like Chinese that uses no overt delimiters. However, there is no linguistic or computational reason in principle why we should treat the recognition of a unit like “electromechanical” (containing no space) as fundamentally different from the recognition of a unit like “electrical engineering” (containing a space). Character-level models offer the potential of uniform treatment of linguistic units that are relevant for NLP."

      "text" : "Many text representation learning algorithms can be understood as estimating the parameters of the model from a unit-context matrix C where each row corresponds to a unit ui, each column to a context cj and each cell Cij is a quantity that measures how strongly ui and cj are associated. For example, the skipgram model is closely related to an SVD factorization of a positive pointwise mutual information matrix (Levy and Goldberg, 2014); in this case, both units and contexts are words. Text representation learning algorithms explicitly formalized as matrix factorization include (Deerwester et al., 1990; Hofmann, 1999; Stratos et al., 2015), but there may not be a big difference between methods that explicitly factorize and those that approximate the factorization through iterative methods (e.g., (Pennington et al., 2014)); see also (Mohamed, 2011; Rastogi et al., 2015).\nOur goal in this paper is not to develop new\nparameter estimation methods, e.g., a new matrix factorization algorithm. Instead, we will focus on defining the unit-context matrix in such a way that no symbolic assumption has to be made. This unitcontext matrix can then be processed by any existing or still to be invented algorithm."

      "text" : "How can we define units and contexts without relying on segmentation boundaries? In initial experiments, we simply generated all character ngrams of length up to kmax (where kmax is a parameter), including character ngrams that cross token boundaries; i.e., no segmentation is needed. We then used an objective similar to the skipgram objective for learning ngram embeddings, i.e., we used an iterative training procedure each instance of which consisted of selecting an ngram g1 and trying to predict an ngram g2 in its context based on g1. Our first naive implementation of this idea did not work well because many training instances consist of pairs (g1, g2) in which g1 and g2 overlap or one is a subsequence of the other. So the objective encourages trivial predictions of ngrams that have high string similarity with the input and nothing interesting is learned.\nIn this paper, we propose an alternative way of defining units and contexts that supports wellperforming nonsymbolic text representation learning: multiple random segmentation. A pointer moves through the training corpus. The current position i of the pointer defines the left boundary of the next segment. The length l of the next move is uniformly sampled from [kmin, kmax] where kmin and kmax are the minimum and maximum segment lengths. The right boundary of the segment is then i+ l. Thus, the segment just generated is ci,i+l, the subsequence of the corpus between (and including) positions i and i+ l. The pointer is positioned at i+ l+1, the next segment is sampled and so on.\nThe corpus is segmented this way m times (where m is a parameter) and the m random segmentations are concatenated. The unit-context matrix is derived form this concatenated corpus.\nMultiple random segmentation has two advantages. First, there is no redundancy since, in any given random segmentation, two ngrams do not overlap and are not subsequences of each other. Second, a single random segmentation would only cover a small part of the space of possible ngrams. For example, a random segmentation of “a rose\nis a rose is a rose” might be “[a ros][e is a ros][e is][a rose]”. This segmentation does not contain the segment “rose” and this part of the corpus can then not be exploited to learn a good embedding for the fourgram “rose”. However, if we produce multiple random segmentations of the corpus (and concatenate them), then it is likely that this part of the corpus does give rise to the segment “rose” in one of the segmentations and can contribute information to learning a good embedding for “rose”."

      "heading" : "3.3 The permutation premise and ngram equivalence classes",
      "text" : "Nonsymbolic representation learning does not preprocess the training corpus by means of tokenization and considers many ngrams that would be ignored in tokenized approaches because they span token boundaries. As a result, the number of ngrams is much larger and sparseness is greatly increased. Figure 1 shows that the number of ngrams that occur in a corpus is an order of magnitude larger for tokenization-free approaches than for tokenization-based approaches.\nWe will see below that this sparseness impacts performance of nonsymbolic text representation negatively. We address sparseness by defining\nngram equivalence classes. All ngrams in an equivalence class will receive the same embedding.\nThe learning procedure for learning equivalence classes is based on two premises.\nPermutation premise. Let A be the alphabet of a language, i.e., its set of characters, π a permutation on A, C a corpus and P (π,C) the transformed corpus after the permutation has been applied to C . For example, if π(a) = e, then all characters “a” in C are replaced with “e” in P (π,C). The learning procedure should learn identical equivalence classes on C and P (π,C). So, if g1 ∼ g2 after runing the learning procedure on C , then P (π, g1) ∼ P (π, g2) after running the learning procedure on P (π,C).\nThis premise is motivated by our desire to come up with a general method that does not rely on specific properties of a language or genre; e.g., the premise rules out exploiting the fact through feature engineering that in many languages and genres, “c” and “C” are related. Such a relationship has to be learned from the data.\nForm-meaning homomorphism premise. The relationship between form and meaning is mostly arbitrary, but there are substructures of the ngram space and the embedding space that are systematically related by homomorphism. In this paper, we will assume that the following homomorphism holds:\ng1RT g2 ⇔ ~v(g1)R=~v(g2)\nwhere g1RT g2 iff T (g1) = T (g2) for a string transduction T and ~v(g1)R=~v(g2) iff |~v(g1) − ~v(g2)|2 < ǫ.\nWe will propose a learning procedure for the transduction below. As a simple example for a meaning-preserving string operation consider “delete a space at the beginning of an ngram”. For the transductor T we will learn below, we have: T (@Mercedes) = T (Mercedes). This is a good example of what a transducer can do because we can reasonably assume that the embeddings of “@Mercedes” and “Mercedes” are the same.\nWe define R= as “closeness” – not as identity – because of estimation noise when embeddings are learned. We assume that there are no true synonyms and therefore the direction g1RT g2 ⇐ ~v(g1)R=~v(g2) also holds. For example, “car” and “automobile” are considered synonyms, but we assume that their embeddings are different (e.g., because “car” has the literary sense “chariot” that\n“automobile” does not have). If they were identical, then the homomorphism would not hold since “car” and “automobile” cannot be converted into each other by any plausible meaning-preserving string operation.\nLearning procedure. To learn the transductor automatically, we define three templates that transform one ngram into another: (i) replace character a1 with character a2, (ii) delete character a1 if its immediate predecessor is character a2, (iii) delete character a1 if its immediate successor is character a2. The learning procedure takes a set of ngrams and their embeddings as input. It then exhaustively searches for all pairs of ngrams, for all pairs of characters a1/a2, for each of the three templates.2 When two matching embeddings exist, we compute their cosine. For example, for the operation “delete space before M”, an ngram pair from our embeddings that matches is “@Mercedes” / “Mercedes” and we compute the cosine of these two embeddings. As the characteristic statistic of an operation we take the average of all cosines; e.g., for “delete space before M” the average cosine is 0.7435. We then rank operations according to average cosine and take the first No as the definition of the transductor where No is a parameter. For characters that are replaced by each other (e.g., 1, 2, 3 in Table 1), we compute the eqivalence class and then replace the learned operations with ones that replace a character by the canonical member of its equivalence class (e.g., 2 → 1, 3 → 1)."

Based on the permutation premise (Section 3.3), we first apply a randomly generated permutation π to C and then conduct all experiments on P (π,C), the permuted form of C . We train three text representation models: FASTTEXT, NONSYMBOLIC and TRANSDUCED. We use a dimensionality of 200 throughout this paper for all models.\nFASTTEXT. We train fastText skipgram (Bojanowski et al., 2016), with default parameters, on P (π,C).\nNONSYMBOLIC. We train word2vec skipgram on a multiple random segmentation corpus that is generated from P (π,C). As we discussed in Section 3.1, our focus in this paper is not to de-\n2This takes about 10 hours on a 20-core compute server for 4,000,000 ngram embeddings.\nvelop new methods for implicit matrix factorization. We therefore selected word2vec because it is a well understood and widely used method.\nWe use default parameters, except that we train for only one iteration since we found this was sufficient. Parameters for the segmentation were m = 50 (number of copies) and kmin = 3, kmax = 9 (min/max length of character ngrams). The average length of words in this type of setting is between 7 and 8,3 the average length of ngrams of the model we learned with word2vec is 6.9, which is roughly comparable. If we used the fastText maximum kmax = 6 for our model, this would clearly not be a fair comparison.\nFor the nonsymbolic experiments (i.e., not for the experiments with fastText), we replace white spaces in C with “@”. The segmenter then simply marks segment boundaries by white space. This trick avoids the need for any change to the implementation of word2vec and we can run it as is.\nTRANSDUCED. We repeat experiment NONSYMBOLIC with a version of the multiple random segmentation corpus that has been transformed by the transductor T .\nTo learn T , we first run the learning procedure described in Section 3.3 on the ngram embeddings that are the output of NONSYMBOLIC. We then rank all operations by the average cosine of the input embedding and output embedding of all pairs that match the operation (see Section 3.3) and select the top No = 200 to define the transductor.\nTable 1 shows a selection of the No operations.4 The two uppercase/lowercase conversions shown in the table were the only ones that were learned (we had hoped for more). The postdeletion rule “ml” → “m” was learned because of “html” → “htm” type ngram pairs. This is good for “html”, but dangerous as a general rule. We inspected all 200 rules and, with a few exceptions like “html” → “htm”, they looked reasonable to us. T applies all 200 operations.\nEVALUATION. We evaluate the three models on an entity typing task based on an entity dataset released by Xie et al. (2016) in which each entity has been assigned one or more types from a set of\n3It is not easy to check the actual average length for FASTTEXT since it only outputs a model in binary format, not a list of embeddings. For word2vec GoogleNews embeddings, the average word length is 7.6.\n4Recall that our experiments are run on a permuted version of Wikipedia (Section 3.3). All examples in the tables and the body of the paper were converted back to the original for better readability.\n50 types. For example, the entity “Harrison Ford” has the types “actor”, “celebrity” and “award winner” among others. We extract mentions from FACC (URL, 2016; Gabrilovich et al., 2013) if an entity has a mention there or we use the Freebase name as the mention otherwise. This gives us a data set of 54,334, 6085 and 6747 mentions in train, dev and test, respectively. Each mention is annotated with the types that its entity has been assigned by Xie et al. (2016). We will release this dataset at time of publication.\nWe perform entity typing by representing each mention as the sum of the embeddings of all ngrams that occur in the mention. Linear SVMs (Chang and Lin, 2011) were then trained, one for each of the 50 types, on train and applied to dev and test. Our evaluation measure is micro F1 on all typing decisions; e.g., one typing decision is: “Harrison Ford” is a mention of type “actor”. We tune thresholds on dev to optimize F1 and then use these thresholds on test.\nTable 2 shows that NONSYMBOLIC outperforms FASTTEXT decisively. We attribute this to two reasons. First, cross-word ngrams are important for entity typing, but these cross-word ngrams are missing from the FASTTEXT model. Sec-\nond, FASTTEXT seems to have many preprocessing heuristics built in that help with text processing in general and also with entity typing. In a small experiment, we trained FASTTEXT on lowercased text and then applied the learned model to uppercase words. Even though no uppercase character occurred in training, FASTTEXT still computed meaningful ngram embeddings. The permutation we use disables this preprocessing and limits the capabilities of the model to what can be learned from distributional information without feature-engineered preprocessing.\nTRANSDUCED gives us an additional improvement. This shows that the operations learned have identified string variations that affect meaning not at all or only slightly."

      "text" : "To analyze the NONSYMBOLIC text embedding model further, Table 3 shows nearest neighbors of ten character ngrams. The search space was limited to 9-grams. Queries were chosen to contain only alphanumeric characters. To highlight the difference to symbol-based representation models, we restricted the search to those 9-grams that contained a delimiter somewhere in the middle of the word (i.e., the first two and last two positions do not count).\nLines 1–4 show that “delimiter variation”, i.e., cases where a word has two forms, one with a delimiter, one without a delimiter, is handled well: “Abdulaziz” / “Abdul Azi”, “codenamed” / “code name”, “Quarterfinal” / “Quarter-Final”, “worldrecord” / “world-record”.\nLines 5–9 are cases of ambiguous or polysemous words that are disambiguated through “character context”. “stem”, “cell”, “rear”, “wheel”, “crash”, “land”, “scripts”, “through”, “downtown” all have several meanings. In contrast, the meanings of “stem cell”, “rear wheel”, “crash land”,\n“(write) scripts for” and “through downtown” are specific and much less ambiguous. A multiword recognizer might be able to find the phrases “stem cell” and “crash land” automatically. But the examples of “scripts for” and “through downtown” show that what is accomplished here is not multiword detection, but a more general use of character context for disambiguation.\nLine 10 shows that a 9-gram of “face-to-face” is the closest neighbor to a 9-gram of “facilitating”. This demonstrates that form and meaning sometimes interact in surprising ways. Facilitating a meeting is most commonly done face-to-face. It is not inconceivable that form – the shared trigram “fac” or the shared fourgram “faci” in “facilitate” / “facing” – is influencing meaning here in a way that also occurs historically in cases like “ear” ‘organ of hearing’ / “ear” ‘head of cereal plant’, originally distinct and unrelated words that many speakers of English today intuit as a single word."

A sequence of characters is represented by a single vector that is computed as the sum of the embeddings of all ngrams that occur in the sequence. In most work on bagof-ngram models, the sequences considered are words or phrases (see Section 5 for citations). In fact, that is what we did in our first experiment. In a few cases, the model is applied to longer sequences, including sentences and documents (e.g., (Wieting et al., 2016)).\nThe basic assumption of the bag-of-ngram model is that sequence information is encoded in the character ngrams and therefore a “bag-of” approach (which usually throws away all sequence information) is sufficient. The assumption is not implausible: for most bags of character sequences, there is only a single way of stitching them together to one coherent sequence, so in that case information is not necessarily lost (although this is likely when embeddings are added). But the assumption has not been tested experimentally.\nEnd-to-end systems that use RNNs (e.g., LSTMs) for sequence processing are not bag-ofngram. But these systems have not been widely used for representation learning. See our discus-\nsion of related work (Section 5). Here, we propose position embeddings, character-ngram-based embeddings that more fully preserve sequence information. The simple idea is to represent each position as the sum of all ngrams that contain that position. For the settings kmin = 3, kmax = 9 in our NONSYMBOLIC model, this means that the position is the sum of ∑ 3≤k≤9 k ngram embeddings (if all of these ngrams have embeddings, which generally will be true for some, but not for most positions). A sequence of n characters is then represented as a sequence of n such position embeddings."

We randomly selected 2,000,000 contexts of size 40 characters from our Wikipedia corpus. We then created a noise context for each of the 2,0000,000 contexts by replacing one character at position i (15 ≤ i ≤ 25, uniformly sampled) with space (p = .5) or a randomly chosen character (p = .5). This was repeated until a sequence was produced that was different from the original context. Finally, we selected 1000 noise contexts randomly and computed their nearest neighbors among the 4,000,000 contexts (excluding the noise query). We did this in two different conditions: for a bag-of-ngram representation of the context and for a sequence of 11 position embeddings, those between 15 and 25. Our evaluation measure is mean reciprocal rank of the clean context corresponding to the noise context. This simulates a text denoising experiment since if the clean context has rank 1, then the noisy context can be corrected.\nTable 4 shows that sequence-preserving position embeddings perform better than bag-ofngram representations.\nTable 5 shows an example of a context in which position embeddings did better than bag-ofngrams. This example demonstrates that impor-\ntant sequence information can be lost by bag-ofngram representations, in this case the exact position in the string of the word “Seahawks”.\nTo give further intuition about what type of information position embeddings contain, we show the ngram embeddings that are closest to position embeddings for an example in Figure 6; e.g., “estseller” (the first 9-gram on the line numbered 3 in the table) is closest to the embedding of position 3 (the letter “s” of the word “best-selling”).

The reader can find the relevant papers by scanning the reference section for papers with the tag of interest.\nOur main goal in this paper is to overcome the limitations of tokenization both in estimating the parameters of a text representation model and in applying it to computing the representation of a new text. Most prior work on characterlevel models has been based on tokenization or, more generally, has addressed tasks that involve processing of words. This class of paper is tagged TOKENIZATION-BASED-MODEL. We also include here models that learn one embedding per Chinese character (which is conceptually and architecturally similar to word embeddings) and models that learn character sequences that are phrases (e.g., named entities). The criterion for inclusion in this group is not that segmentation is identical to standard tokenization; instead, the criterion is that a segmentation is computed and each segment boundary is a traditional token boundary. Note that many rule-based tokenizers produce tokens that contain spaces (e.g., Kaplan (2006)).\nThere have been two main approaches that are not tokenization-based. The first one learns character ngram embeddings (from tokenized text or short text segments in all prior work that we have reviewed), but then computes the representation of new text segments without the need for tokenization by summing the embeddings of all occurring ngrams. We have shown above that important sequence information is lost in this approach. This class of paper is tagged BAG-OFNGRAM-MODEL. We also include sparse repre-\nsentation spaces whose dimensionality is the number of ngrams, i.e., non-embedding approaches. Many methods compute token representations in a bag-of-ngram fashion. We only tag papers as bag-of-ngram that go beyond word and token representations.\nEnd-to-end approaches to speech and natural language processing (Eyben et al., 2009; Graves and Jaitly, 2014; Gillick et al., 2015; Bahdanau et al., 2016; Chan et al., 2016) are the second main tokenization-free approach.

There seems little work that has exploited this, but see (Chrupala, 2013; Evang et al., 2013; Chrupala, 2014).\nWe took the idea of random segmentation from work on biological sequences (Asgari and Mofrad, 2015; Asgari and Mofrad, 2016). Biological sequences have no delimiters, so they provide a good model if one believes that delimiter-based segmentation is problematic for text."

[bytes allow us to achieve] something like blurring with text.” “Blurring” is not a completely accurate description: a byte can only be altered by flipping a bit, a discrete process that turns, e.g., “B” (100010) into “C” (100011). In contrast, the text representation we have introduced in this paper can be blurred in a way that is completely analogous to images and speech. Each embedding of a position is a vector that can be smoothly changed in every direction. We plan to exploit this property in future work.\nThe most important challenge that we need to address is how to use nonsymbolic text representation for tasks that are word-based like partof-speech tagging. This may seem like a contradiction at first, but Gillick et al. (2015) have shown how character-based methods can be used for “symbolic” tasks.
