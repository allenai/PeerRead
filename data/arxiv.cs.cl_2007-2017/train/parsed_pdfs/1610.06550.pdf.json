      "text" : "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is the application of deep neural networks to translation of text. NMT is based on an end-to-end trainable algorithm that can learn to translate just by being presented with translated language pairs. Despite being a relatively new approach, NMT has in recent years surpassed classical statistical machine translation models and now holds state-of-the-art results [Chung et al., 2016, Luong and Manning, 2016, Wu et al., 2016].\nEarly NMT models introduced by Cho et al. [2014a], Kalchbrenner and Blunsom [2013], Sutskever et al. [2014] are based on the encoder-decoder network architecture. Here the encoder compresses an input sequence of variable length from the source language to a fixed-length vector representing the sentiment of the sentence. The decoder, takes the fixed-length representation as input and produces a variable length translation in the target language. However, due to the fixed length representation the naïve encoder-decoder approach have limitations when translating longer sequences.\nTo overcome this shortcoming, the attention mechanism proposed by Bahdanau et al. [2014] assists the decoder by learning to selectively attend to parts of the input sequence, which it deems most relevant for generating the next element in the output sequence and effectively reducing the distance from encoding to decoding. This approach has made it possible for encoder-decoder models to produce high quality\ntranslations over longer sequences. However, it suffers from the significant amount of computational power and memory needed to compute the relevance of every element of the input sequence for every element of the output sequence.\nFor this reason, training the models on individual characters is not practical, and most current solutions instead use word segmentation [Bahdanau et al., 2014, Sutskever et al., 2014] or multiple characters [Schuster and Nakajima, 2012, Sennrich et al., 2015, Wu et al., 2016] to represent sentences. However, this high-level segmentation approach has a set of drawbacks; most Latin based languages have millions of words with the majority occurring rarely. To handle this, current models use confined dictionaries with only the k most common words with the remaining words being represented by a special <UNK>-token [Bahdanau et al., 2014, Sutskever et al., 2014]. As a result, names, places, and other rare words are typically translated as unknown by these models. Further, when all words are represented as separate entities, the model has to learn how every word is related to one-another, which can be challenging for rare words even if they are obvious variations of more frequent words [Luong and Manning, 2016]. Figure 2 illustrates some of the challenges of characters versus words for the encoder-decoder model.\nTwo branches of methods to circumvent these drawbacks have been proposed. The first branch is based on extending\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n06 55\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n0 O\nct 2\n01 6\nthe current word-based encoder-decoder model to incorporate modules, such as dictionary look-up for out-of-dictionary words [Jean et al., 2014, Luong et al., 2014]. The second branch, which we will investigate in this work, is moving towards smaller units of computation.\nIn this paper we demonstrate models that use a new char2word mechanism (illustrated in figure 1) during encoding, which reduces long character-level input sequences to word-level representations. This approach has the advantages of keeping a small alphabet of possible input values and preserving relations between words that are spelled similarly, while significantly reducing the number of elements that the attention mechanism needs to consider for each output element it generates. Using this method the decoder’s memory and computational requirements are reduced, making it feasible to train the models on long sequences of characters as input and output. Thus avoiding the drawbacks of word based models described above. And lastly, we give a qualitative analysis of attention plots produced by a character-level encoder-decoder model with and without the hierarchical encoding mechanism, char2word. This shed light on how a character-level model uses attention, which might explain some of the success behind the BPE and hybrid models."

      "text" : "Other approaches to circumventing the increase in sequence lengths while reducing the dictionary size have been proposed: First, byte-pair Encoding (BPE) [Sennrich et al., 2015], currently holding state-of-the-art in the WMT’14 English-to-French and English-to-German [Wu et al., 2016], where the dictionary is a combination of the most common characters. In practice this means that most frequent words are encoded using fewer bits than less frequent words. Secondly, a hybrid model [Luong and Manning, 2016] where a word encoder-decoder consults a character encoder-decoder when confronted with out-of-dictionary words. Thirdly, pretrained word-based encoder-decoder models with character input used for creating word embeddings [Ling et al., 2015]\nhave been shown to achieve similar results to word-based approaches. As a last mention, character decoder with BPE encoder has shown to be end-to-end trained successfully [Chung et al., 2016].\nWu et al. [2016] provides a good summary and large-scale demonstration of many of the techniques that are known to work well for NMT and RNNs in general. The RNN encoderdecoder with attention approach is used not only within machine translation, but can be regarded as a general architecture to extract information from a sequence and answer some type of question related to it [Kumar et al., 2015]."

The conditional probability p(y|x) is modelled by an encoder-decoder model where the encoder and the decoder are modelled by separate Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and the whole model is trained end-to-end on a large parallel corpus. The model uses memory based RNN variants, as they enable modelling of longer dependencies in the sequences [Cho et al., 2014b, Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997].\nThe encoder part (input RNN) computes a set of hidden representations, h1, h2, . . . , hTx based on the input\nht = h(xt, ht−1) (1)\nwhere h is a RNN with memory cells, ht ∈ Rmh is a hidden state representation at time step t, with mh hidden units.\nThe decoder part (output RNN) then computes a context vector, ct, based on the hidden representations from the encoder:\nct = q(h1, h2, . . . , hTx), (2)\nwhere q is a function that takes a set of hidden representations and returns a context vector ct ∈ Rmc where mc number of context units.

      "text" : "We propose two models: The char-to-char NMT model and the char2word-to-char NMT model. Both models build on the encoder-decoder model with attention as defined in section 3.1 and section 3.1.1. Below we will give specific model definitions.\n4.1. The char encoder\nOur character-level encoder (referred to as the char encoder) is built upon a bi-directional RNN [Schuster and Paliwal, 1997]. The encoder function, ht, in equation (1) becomes\nht =\n[ hf (Ext, −−→ ht−1)\nhb(Ext, ←−− ht+1),\n] (9)\nwhere xt ∈ {0, 1}mx is a one-hot encoded vector and mx is the amount of input classes, E ∈ Rme×mx is an embedding matrix with me being the size of the embedding, hf and hb are RNN functions and h is initialised as h0 = 0.\nThe char encoder is illustrated with the yellow arrows and blue circles in figure 3.\n4.2. The char2word encoder\nThe character-to-word-level encoder (referred to as the char2word encoder) samples states from the forward pass of the char encoder defined in the above section. The states it samples are based on the locations of spaces in the original text, resulting in a sequence of outputs from the char encoder that essentially represents the words from the text and acts as their embeddings. We sample the indices from −→ h , such that\nhspacest = −→ h ϕt, (10)\nwhere −→ h t is defined from above equation (9) and ϕ is an ordered list of indices defining spaces in the input sequence x. Given hspaces equation (9) is used with hspacest replacing Ext.\nThe char2word encoder is illustrated with the yellow arrows and blue circles in figure 1.\nA result of this “downsampling” by using spaces, the char2word encoder only has about a fifth of the hidden states the char encoder has. As we described in the introduction, the computationally expensive part of the encoderdecoder with attention is the attention part. By significantly reducing the encoder we could train the char2word encoder in half the time compared to the char encoder.\n4.3. The char decoder\nOur character-level decoder (referred to as the char decoder) works with characters as the smallest unit of computation and decodes one character at a time. The decoder uses a RNN and the attention mechanism [Bahdanau et al., 2014] when decoding each character.\nThe new state in our decoder RNN, st, as defined in equation (5) is computed as follows\nst = f(st−1, yt−1, ct), (11)\nst = f( [ E′pt−1 ct ] , si−1) (12)\npt−1 = arg max(yt−1), (13)\nwhere pt−1 ∈ 0, 1kp is a one-hot encoded vector with kp being the amount of input classes, E′ ∈ Rm′e×mp is an embedding matrix with m′e being the size of the embedding, f is a RNN function and s is initialised as s0 = hTx ."

In order to stabilise training and avoid exploding gradients, the norms of the gradients are clipped with a threshold of 1 before updating the parameters. All models are implemented using TensorFlow [Abadi et al., 2016] and the code and details of the setup are available on GitHub3."

Training translation models is further complicated by the fact that source and target sentences, while correlated, may have different lengths, and it is necessary to consider both when constructing batches in order to utilize computation power and RAM optimally.\nTo circumvent this issue, we start each epoch by shuffling all samples in the dataset and sorting them with a stable sorting algorithm according to both the source and target sentence\n1We used the multi-bleu.perl script from Moses (https:// github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder).\n2From Moses (https://github.com/moses-smt/ mosesdecoder) using normalize-punctuation.perl and tokenizer.perl\n3https://github.com/Styrke/master-code\nlengths. This ensures that any two samples in the dataset that have almost the same source and target sentence lengths are located close to each other in the sorted list while the exact order of samples varies between epochs. To pack a batch we simply started adding samples from the sorted sample list to the batch, until we reached the maximal total allowed character threshold (which we set to 50,000) for the full batch with padding after which we would start on a new batch. Finally all the batches are fed in random order to the model for training until all samples have been trained on, and a new epoch begins. Figure 5 illustrates what such dynamic batches might look like."

We have provided plots of both our char-to-char- and char2word-to-char models in figures 6 and 7. The more intense the blue colour, the higher the values of atj at that point. Notice that each column corresponds to the decoding of a single unit, resulting in each column summing to 1.\nThe char-to-char attention plot, attending over every character, interestingly indicates that words that would normally\nbe considered out-of-dictionary (see Lisette Verhaig in figure 6) are translated character by character-by-character, whereas common words are attended at the end/start of each word 4 to use as a single embedding. This observation might explain why using hierarchical encoding improves performance. BPE based models and the hybrid word-char model by Luong and Manning [2016] effectively works in the same manner, when translating common words BPE- and hybrid word-char models will work on a word level, whereas with rare words the BPE will work with sub-parts of the word (maybe even characters) and the hybrid approach will use character representations.\nThe char2word-to-char attention plot has words, or character-made embeddings of words, to perform attention over. The attention plot seems very similar to the BPE-toChar plot proposed by Chung et al. [2016]. This might indicate that it is possible to imitate lexeme (word) based models using smaller dictionaries and preserving relationship between words."

We find that the hierarchical encoding, using our newly proposed char2word encoding mechanism, improves the the BLEU score by an average of 1.28 compared to models using a standard character encoder.\nQualitatively, we find that the attention of a character model without hierarchical encoding learns to make hierarchical representations even without being explicitly told to do so, by switching between word and character embeddings for common and rare words. This observation is in line with current research on Byte-Pair-Encoding- and hybrid word-character models, as these models uses word like embeddings for common words and sub-words or characters for rare words.\nFurthermore, qualitatively we find that our hierarchical encoding finds lexemes in the source sentence when decoding similarly to current models with much larger dictionaries using Byte-Pair-Encoding.\n4As we use a bi-directional RNN, full information will be available at both the end and start of a word"
