      "text" : "Dictionary learning (DL), as a particular sparse signal model, aims to learn a set of atoms, or called visual words in the computer vision community, in which a few atoms can be linearly combined to well approximate a given signal. From the view of compression sensing, it is originally designed to learn an adaptive codebook to faithfully represent the signals with sparsity constraint. In recent years, researchers have applied DL framework to other applications and achieved state-of-the-art performances, such as image denoising [3] and inpainting [4], clustering [2, 9], classification [1, 6], etc.\nIt is well-known that the conventional DL framework is not adapted to classification as a result that the learned dictionary is merely used for signal reconstruction. Therefore, to circumvent this problem, researchers have developed several approaches to learn a classification-oriented dictionary in a supervised learning fashion by exploring the label information. In this note, we review the some existing representative DL-based classification methods. Through comparison, we can roughly divide them into two categories: (1) directly forcing the dictionary discriminative, or (2) making the sparse coefficients discriminative (usually through simultaneously learning a classifier) to promote the discrimination of the dictionary. The first category, named Track I in this note, mainly uses representation error for the final classification, whereas, the second category (Track II) can utilize the sparse coefficients as new feature representation for classification.\nTrack I includes Meta-face learning [12] and DL with structured incoherence [8], and Track II contains supervised DL [6], discriminative K-SVD [13], label consistence K-SVD [5] and Fisher discrimination DL [11]. The abbreviations of these methods are listed in Table 1.\nThe organization of this note is as follows. In the end of this section, we review an important method called sparse representation-based classification [10], then introduce the general dictionary learning framework with notations used in this note. Note that even though SRC do not learn dictionaries, it opens the prologue of classification based on sparse coding technique. In Section 2, we introduce Meta-face learning [12] and DLSI [8] as two specific examples of Track I, which uses the reconstruction error for the final classification like what SRC does. Its counterpart, i.e. Track II, will presented in Section 3, including SupervisedDL [6], D-KSVD [13], LC-KSVD [5] and FisherDL [11]. In Section 4, we give a brief summary on DL-based classification methods, and expect some extensions in the future work."

      "text" : "Wright et al. [10] propose the sparse representation based classification (SRC) method for robust face recognition, and achieve very impressive results. Suppose there are C classes of individual faces, let D = [X1, . . . ,Xc, . . . ,XC ] ∈ R d×N be the set of original training samples, where Xc ∈ R d×Nc is the sub-set of all the Nc vector-represented training samples from class c. SRC treats the original data set as an overall dictionary. Denote by x ∈ Rd a query facial image, then SRC identifies x as the following two-stage procedure:\n1. sparsely code x over X via ℓ1-norm minimization\na = argmin a ‖x−Da‖2 2 + λ‖a‖1, (1)\nwhere λ is a scalar constant.\n2. identify x to the cth class that\nc = argmin i ‖x−Xiδi(a)‖ 2 2 , (2)\nwhere δi(·) is a vector indicator function that extract the elements corresponding to the i th class.\nSRC achieves very impressive performance in face recognition, and robust to noises such as occlusion, lighting, etc. Even if SRC learns no dictionaries for classification, it acts as one vanguard to open the prologue of classification with the help of sparse coding. In this view, we can see SRC naively uses all the training samples as one dictionary, wherein the class-specific training sets are sub-dictionaries contributing to discrimination."

It is believed that classification performance will be further improved if we carefully learn a classificationoriented dictionary. In next section, we will have a look at several DL-based classification methods belonging to Track I."

Inspired by SRC, Yang et al. propose meta-face learning [12] to learn an adaptive dictionary for each class, and Ramirez et al. add a sophisticated term to derive more delicate classification-oriented dictionaries. Now, we present the two methods."

      "text" : "SRC directly adopts the original facial images as the dictionary, however, as discussed in [12], this pre-defined dictionary will incorporate much redundancy as well as noise and trivial information that can can be negative to the face recognition. Additionally, when the training data grows, the computation of sparse coding will become a main bottleneck. Focusing on this problem, Yang et al. [12] propose a Metaface learning method to learn a class-specific dictionary for each object:\nDi = argmin Di ‖Xi −DiAi‖ 2 2 + λ‖Ai‖1,\ns.t. ‖dij‖2 ≤ 1, ∀j = 1, . . . ,K, (4)\nwhere matrix Xi ∈ R d×Ni contains all the training images from the ith class as its columns, dij is the jth column of the ith class-specific sub-dictionary Di = [d i 1 , . . . ,diK ] ∈ R\nd×K , and ‖Ai‖1 is defined as the summation of ℓ1-norm of all the columns of Ai = [a\ni 1 , . . . , aiNi ] ∈ R K×Ni , i.e.\n‖Ai‖1 = ∑Ni j ‖a i j‖1.

      "heading" : "2.2 Dictionary Learning with Structured Incoherence",
      "text" : "Ramirez et al. note that the learned sub-dictionaries may share some common bases, i.e. some visual words from different sub-dictionaries can be very coherent [8]. Undoubtedly, the coherence of the atoms can be used for reconstructing the query image interchangeably, and the reconstruction error based classifier will fail in identifying some queries. To circumvent this problem, they add an incoherence term term to drive the dictionaries associated to different classes as independent as possible.\nThe incoherence term is denoted as Q(Di,Dj) = ‖D T i Dj‖ 2 F . It is easy to see this term drives the atoms from different sub-dictionaries to be as independent/incoherent as possible. Therefore, Ramirez et al. derive the final dictionary learning method with structured incoherence as below:\nmin {Di,Ai}i=1,...,C\nC ∑\ni=1\n{\n‖Xi −DiAi‖ 2 F + λ‖Ai‖1\n}\n+ η ∑\ni6=j\n‖DTi Dj‖ 2 F , (5)\nwhere Ai = [a 1 i , . . . , a ni i ] ∈ R ki×ni , each column aji is the sparse code corresponding to the signal j ∈ [1, . . . , ni] in class i.\nThey empirically note that even though the incoherence term is imposed in the dictionaries, atoms representing common features in all classes tend to appear repeated almost exactly in dictionaries corresponding to different classes [8]. Being so common, these atoms are used often and their associated reconstruction coefficients have a high absolute value |ar|, r ∈ {1, . . . , ki}, thus making the reconstruction costs similar. They further propose to detect such atoms is to inspect the already available DTi Dj matrices, whose absolute values represent the inner products between atoms. By ignoring the coefficients associated to these common atoms when computing the reconstruction error, they improve the discriminatory power of the system."

Here qn = [0, . . . , 1, . . . , 1, 0, . . . , 0] T ∈ RK is an indicator corresponding to the input signal xn from suitable class: the non-zero values of qn occur at those indices where the input signal xn and the dictionary codeword dk share the same label.\nThe term ‖Q−GA‖2F represents the discriminative sparse-code error, which enforces that the sparse codes A approximate the discriminative sparse codes Q. It forces the signals from the same class to have very similar sparse representations, i.e. encouraging label consistency in resulting sparse codes. At the same time, the linear regression term ‖H−WA‖2F is added, which is the same as that of D-KSVD [13]. Intuitively, the final classification mechanism is very fast owing to the classifier parameter matrix W."

      "heading" : "3.4 Fisher Discriminant Dictionary Learning",
      "text" : "Yang et al. propose Fisher discrimination dictionary learning (FisherDL) method based on the Fisher criterion to learn a structured dictionary [11], whose atom has correspondence to the class label. The structured dictionary is denoted as D = [D1, . . . ,DC ], where Dc is the class-specific sub-dictionary associated with the cth class. Denote the data set X = [X1, . . . ,XC ], where Xc is the sub-set of the\ntraining samples from the cth class. Then they solve the following formulation over the dictionary and the coefficients to derive the desired discriminative dictionary:\n(D,A) = argmin D∈Rd×K\nA∈RK×N\nC(X,D,A) + λ1‖A‖1 + λ2f(A),\ns.t. ‖di‖ 2 2 ≤ 1, for ∀i = 1, . . . , N ,\n(9)\nwhere C(X,D,A) is the discriminative fidelity term (pending to discuss it as below); ‖A‖1 is the sparsity constraint; f(A) is a discrimination constraint (as discussed below) imposed on the coefficient matrix A.\nThe discriminative fidelity term We can write Ai, the representation of Xi over D, as Ai = [A1i ; . . . ;A c i ; . . . ;A C i ], where A c i is the coding coefficient of Xi over the sub-dictionary Dc. Denote the representation of Dc to Xi as Rc = DcA c i . First of all, the dictionary D should be able to well representXi, and there is Xi ≈ DAi = D1A 1 i +· · ·+DjA j i+· · ·+DCA C i = R1+· · ·+Rj+· · ·+RC . Second, since Di is associated with the i th class, it is expected that Xi should be well represented by Di but not by Dj , j 6= i. This implies that A i should have some significant coefficients such that Xi −DiA i i is small, while A j i should have nearly zero coefficients such that DjA j i is small. Thus the discriminative fidelity term is defined as:\nC(Xi,D,Ai) =‖Xi −DAi‖ 2 F + ‖Xi −DiA i i‖ 2 F + ∑\nj 6=i\n‖DjA j i‖ 2 F , (10)\nThe discriminative coefficient term To make dictionary D be discriminative for the samples in X, we can make the coding coefficient of X over D, i.e. A, be discriminative. Based on Fisher Criterion, this can be achieved by minimizing the within-class scatter of A, denoted by SW and maximizing the between-class scatter of A, denoted by SB. SW and SB are defined as:\nSW =\nC ∑\nc=1\n∑\nxi∈Xc\n(ai −mc)(ai −mc) T\nSB =\nC ∑\nc=1\n(mc −m)(mc −m) T\nIntuitively, we can define f(A) as tr(SW ) − tr(SB). However, such an f(A) is non-convex and unstable. To solve this problem, we propose to add an elastic term ‖A‖2F into f(A):\nf(A) = tr(SW )− tr(SB) + η‖A‖ 2 F (11)\nIncorporating all the terms, we have the following FDDL model:\n(D,A) = argmin D,A\n{\nC ∑\nc=1\nC(Xi,D,Ai) + λ2(tr(SW )− tr(SB) + η‖A‖ 2 F ) + λ1‖A‖1\n}\n(12)\nThere are some crucial issues related to their model, such as the convexity of f(A) and sparse coding, and they discuss these issue in depth [11]. As for classification, they still utilize the reconstruction error as that of Track I."

      "heading" : "4 Summary",
      "text" : "In previous two sections, we review some representative DL-based classification approaches, both from Track I and Track II. Obviously, it is intuitive but effective to add some sophisticated discrimination term to the conventional DL framework to derive a well-learned dictionary for classification.\nIf we check these methods, we can anticipate a general framework here:\nmin D,W,A C(Y,X,D,A) + ηf(W,A,Y) + λAhA(A) + λWhW(W)\ns.t. constraint on D, (13)\nwhere C(Y,X,D,A) is the conventional DL framework, f(W,A,Y) is the discrimination term on the sparse coefficients, hA and hW are the Lagrange constraints on the sparse coefficient matrix A and the projector W, η and λ’s are scalars to balance their weights. Note W does not necessarily mean only one projector, but rather represents several ones. From Eq. 13, we can see that, by employing the label matrix Y, the discriminative dictionary can be learned directly in the term C(Y,X,D,A), at the same time, the term f(W,A,Y) can also propagate the discrimination power of the coefficients to the dictionary, making the dictionary even more discriminative and reliable for classification. Obviously, if we set η = 0, Eq. 13 degrades to Track I; if we omit the label information in term C(Y,X,D,A), Eq. 13 degenerates to Track II. Note that FisherDL [11] can also be cast as a specific example of Eq. 13, which drives the dictionary to be as discriminative as possible from two directions (direct push and indirect push by the coefficients).\nBesides, the main concern seems to be the trade-off between the classification accuracy and the complexity of formulation. Furthermore, when meeting large scale database, these methods will be time consuming in learning the dictionary. Therefore, how to extend these method to online version is an interesting but significant research."

We do not review the sophisticated methods or frameworks that involve DL for classification, such as online DL and spatial pyramid matching (SPM), but rather, we concentrate on the direct DL-based classification methods. Here, the “so-called direct DL-based method” is the approach directly deals with DL framework by adding some meaningful penalty terms. By listing some representative methods, we can roughly divide them into two categories, i.e. (1) directly making the dictionary discriminative and (2) forcing the sparse coefficients discriminative to push the discrimination power of the dictionary. From this taxonomy, we can expect some extensions of them as future researches.",
