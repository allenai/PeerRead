      "text" : "Process mining is a technique that enables the automatic analysis of business processes based on event logs. Instead of designing a workflow, process mining consists in gathering the information of the tasks that take place during the workflow process and storing that data in structured formats called the event logs (van der 2011). While gathering this information, it is assumed that (1) each event refers to a task in the business process, (2) each event is associated to an instance of the workflow and (3) since the events are stored by their execution time, it is assumed that they are sorted (van der Aalst et al. 2004).\nDuring the last decade, process mining has been growing a lot of attention in the scientific community due to its promise to provide techniques for process discovery that will lead to an increase of productivity and to the reduction of costs (van der Aalst & de Medeiros 2005).\nar X\niv :1\n50 3.\n07 34\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 5\nM ar\n2 01\n5\nProcess modelling can be seen as the techniques to graphically represent a business process. This graphical representation describes dependencies between activities that need to be executed together in order to fulfil a business target (Weske 2012).\nSince in process mining the order of the events is taken into consideration, there are already many models that can be directly applied to represent the workflow. Some of those models include Markov Chains (Ferreira et al. 2007, Rebuge & Ferreira 2012), Petri Nets (van der Aalst 1998), Neural Networks (Cook & Wolf 1998) and BPMN (van der 2011). However, Markov Chains and Petri Nets are the models that are most used in the literature of process mining (Tiwari et al. 2008).\nIn this work, it is proposed an alternative representation of business process by using Bayesian Networks. A Bayesian Networks can be defined as an acyclic directed graph in which each node represents a random variable and each edge represents a direct influence from the source node to the target node (conditional dependencies) (Spirtes et al. 2001). They differ from Markov Chains, because of their cycle-free and directed structure. Moreover, Bayesian Networks have the advantage of dealing with uncertainty differently from Markov Chains. In the latter, business processes are modelled as a chain of events that are observed to occur. Under a Bayesian Network perspective, this does not apply: each task can either be present or absent in the business process. Therefore, it is possible to perform special analysis that will enable the computation of the probability of some task of the business process occurring, given that we do not know which tasks have already been performed (Pearl 2009).\nWith this research work, we argue that the capabilities of Bayesian Networks provide a promising technique to model business processes, to perform analysis regarding risk management, cost reduction, finding irrelevant / repetitive tasks, etc.\nThe outline of this work is as follows. Section 2 presents a brief summary of Markov Chains. Section 3 makes an introduction to Bayesian Networks. It shows how to compute probabilistic inferences and presents some learning techniques that are used to automatically learn conditional probabilities in Bayesian Networks. Section 4 presents how Bayesian Networks can be applied in the realm of process mining. This section demonstrates how one can define the structure of a Bayesian Network and how one can perform automatic learning. Section 5 presents a case study in which we apply the proposed network. Finally, Section 6 summarises the current work, presents the main conclusions achieved and some directions for future work."

One is to construct the network by hand and to use the knowledge of an expert to estimate the conditional probability tables. The second is to use statistical models to automatically learn these probabilities (Koller & Friedman 2009).\nEstimating the conditional probabilities by hand with the knowledge of an expert is problematic for several reasons. In some situations, the network is so big that it is almost impossible for the expert to make a reliable assignment of the probabilities to the random variables. Moreover, in many situations, the distribution of the data varies according to its application and through time. This makes it impossible for an expert to reliably estimate the probabilities associated to the random variables of the Bayesian Network.\nStatistical models, on the other hand, offer a mechanism to automatically learn a model that repre-\nsents the probability distribution of some population.\nAccording to the situation that one is modelling, one can have a fully observed dataset or have an incomplete dataset (or partially observed). For the scope of this work, we will only address the problem of learning in Bayesian Networks with a fully observed dataset and a known graphical structure. The data are considered fully observed if on each of the training instances there is a full instantiation to all the random variables of our sample space (Murphy 2012)."

The mean and the variance of the probability distribution can be estimated by only knowing a partial sample of the dataset (Bishop 2007).\nSuppose that we have a Bayesian Network just like specified in Figure 3. This network is parameterized by a parameter vector θ which specifies the parameters for the conditional probability distribution of the network.\nThe training instances regarding Figure 3 consist in a tuple of the form 〈x [m] ,y [m]〉, where x is an instance of the random variable X , y is an instance of the random variable Y and m is the mth training example from the training dataset D of size M.\nThe likelihood function is given by:\nL(θ : D) = M\n∏ m=1 Pr(x [m] ,y [m] : θ) (16)\nSince in a Bayesian Network we can specify a full joint probability distribution Pr(x [m] ,y [m] : θ)\nby the chain rule, then, Equation 16 becomes:\nL(θ : D) = ∏ m Pr(x [m] : θX)Pr(y [m] |x [m] : θY |X) (17)\nL(θ : D) = (\n∏ m\nPr(x [m] : θX) )(\n∏ m\nPr(y [m] |x [m] : θY |X) )\n(18)\nEquation 18 shows that the likelihood function can be decomposed into two separate terms. If we had N random variables, then Equation 18 would also have N terms. Each of these terms is called a local likelihood function and can estimate how well a variable can predict its parents.\nMoreover, one can expand the second term of Equation 18 for each instance of x in the following\nway:\n∏ m Pr(y [m] |x [m] : θY |X) = ∏ m:x[m]=xtrue Pr(y [m] |x [m] : θY |xtrue) ∏ m:x[m]=x f alse Pr(y [m] |x [m] : θY |x f alse) (19)\nGoing back to the simple Bayesian Network in Figure 3, if we analyse the first term of Equation19, we can see that it refers to the number of instances of the training data in which x = true. This gives us two sets: x = true,y = true and x = true,y = f alse. Equation 20 discriminates these instances.\n∏ m:x[m]=xtrue Pr(y [m] |x [m] : θY |xtrue) = θy=true|x=true.θy= f alse|x=true (20)\nThen, Equation 20 becomes:\nθy= f alse|x=true = count(〈x = true,y = f alse〉)\ncount(〈x = true,y = f alse〉)+ count(〈x = true,y = true〉) (21)\nθy= f alse|x=true = count(〈x = true,y = f alse〉)\ncount(〈x = true〉) (22)\nFrom Equation 22, we can see that the maximum likelihood estimate for a Bayesian Network with a known structure and fully observed data consists in simply counting how many times each of the possible assignments of X and Y appear in the training data. In order to obtain a probability value, we normalize this score by counting the total number of instances that class X appears."

It was developed by the Automated Reasoning Group form the University of California1.\nSamIam is composed of a graphical interface and a reasoning engine. The graphical interface provides an easy way to model Bayesian Networks by specifying the random variables as nodes, causal connections as edges and the respective conditional probability tables. The reasoning engine, on the other hand, can perform classical inferences over the plotted Bayesian Network, make parameter estimations by learning mechanisms, sensitivity analysis, etc. For the scope of this work, only the classical\n1http://reasoning.cs.ucla.edu/samiam/\ninference and the learning mechanisms will be necessary.\nExamples of SamIam’s graphical interface are given by Figures 4 to 9.\nFigure 4: SamIam representation of the Bayesian Network of Figure 2.\nFigure 5: Example of SamIam’s inference engine: Pr(R|W = T ), Pr(S|W = T ).\nIn Figure 4, it is presented the Bayesian Network from Figure 2 under the SamIam graphical interface. The marginal probabilities for each node are automatically computed as soon as the user builds the Bayesian Network. Figure 4 shows that: Pr(R = T ) = 0.2, Pr(R = F) = 0.8, Pr(S = T ) = 0.3220, Pr(S = F) = 0.6780, Pr(W = T ) = 0.4484, Pr(W = F) = 0.5516.\nFigure 5 represents a graphical representation of the inference that was manually computed in Equations 8 and 12. The red markers represent variables which are observed. That is, variables, which have occurred. They can be seen as the conditions of probabilities. For instance, in the manually computed probability in Equation 6, the observed variable was the condition W = T , that is, we are asking the probability of Raining given that it was observed that the grass was wet.\nFor large Bayesian Networks, the inference process becomes very heavy and hard to be computed manually. Therefore, SamIam provides an easy interface that automatically performs such heavy operations.\nIn process mining, event logs are usually associated with a large amount of tasks, which can be\nmapped into nodes of a Bayesian Network. Consequently, for the scope of this work, we chose the capabilities of SamIam to automatically compute inferences related to the probability of certain sequences of tasks occurring. This mechanism will be more detailed in Section 4.2 of this work."

From this structure, it is possible to automatically learn the conditional probability tables from a complete log of events using the Maximum Likelihood Estimations (Section 3.2.1). If the log is incomplete, then a Bayesian Network can also automatically learn and estimate the probability tables through the usage of EM Clustering, just like used in the work of Bobek et al. (2013), who developed a Bayesian Network to recommend business processes.\nIn the literature, business processes that are learnt from event logs are usually represented by either Markov Chains or Petri Nets (Weske 2012). In this work, however, we propose another approach to model business processes using Bayesian Networks. The reason why we do this is concerned with the fact that Bayesian Networks can deal with uncertainty more easily.\nBayesian Networks provide advantages in situations where we do not know if some task has occurred and we need to determine the probability of the process terminating or the probability of the process reaching some other task. Therefore, these structures provide more insights when there are high levels of uncertainty when compared to Markov Chains."

      "text" : "Another advantage of Bayesian Networks is that they allow the direct representation of business process diagrams by capturing the direct dependencies between tasks. However, they do not allow an explicit representation of cycles, because Bayesian Networks are directed acyclic graphs. To represent a cycle, in a Bayesian Network, one would need to create many instances of the same node, which is intractable to perform inferences, since the inference problem is NP-Complete (Figures 10 and 11).\nIn this work, in order to eliminate cycles from the log of events, we used an heuristic that would\nchoose the most probable transitions between nodes. For instance, suppose that there is a transition from nodes A→ B that occurred 900 times. Suppose also that there is a transition from nodes B→ A that occurred 100 times. Following the proposed heuristic, we would only represent the Bayesian Network with the transition A→ B. Figures 12 and 13 illustrates this example.\nAnother structure that Bayesian Networks cannot represent directly is concerned with mutual exclusion. Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time. Bayesian Networks can capture mutually exclusive events through the notions of independence by manually adding new edges to the network. For instance, consider the business process represented by the Bayesian Network in Figure 14. Nodes B and C represent the end of the process, while node A represents a task that begins the process. In this situation, and following the semantics of the business process, it is required that nodes B and C become mutually exclusive. That is, the process flow can only end in one of these nodes and not on both of them at the same time.\nAs one can see in Figures 15 and 16, the Bayesian Network cannot represent this mutual exclusion. When computing Bayesian Inferences, all nodes depend on each other. Therefore, in order to semantically represent node B cannot occur at the same time as node C, one needs to add an extra edge between\nB→ C. This additional edge will create a new dependency between these nodes. One can manually configure the conditional probability table of node C to represent this mutually exclusion: when node B is set to true, then the probability of occurring C is zero and vice-versa. The mutual exclusion of the Bayesian Network in Figure 14 is illustrated in Figures 17 to 19.\nNote that, in Figures 17 to 19, the probability of node C occurring when nothing is observed changed when compared to the Bayesian Network of Figure 14. This happened, because of the extra edge that was added in the later Bayesian Network, which ended up changing the configurations of the conditional probability tables and, consequently, final probability values."

There are two modes in SamIam: the query mode (for learning and inferences) and the edit mode (for network structure and definition of conditional probabilities). When SamIam is started, the edit mode appears by default. Figure 20 describes the general edit mode interface.\nThe interface enables the creation/removal of nodes and the creation/removal of edges between nodes. For each node created, there will be a configuration window that can be accessed when the node is double-clicked. In this window, one must specify a unique identifier for the node and a name to be displayed in the SamIam interface. Additionally, one also needs to specify which states the node can have. For the scope of this work, we will only have binary random variables, so each node will have exactly two states: one representing the occurrence of the random variable and another representing its absence.\nThe conditional probability table can be accessed by clicking the tab Probailities. A windows,\nsimilar to the one presented in Figure 21, will appear.\nIn this window, a user can manually specify the conditional probabilities of the random variable. by default, Samiam fills these tables using a normal probability distribution, that is, each instance of each node has the same probability of occurring (Pr = 0.5 ).\nThe buttons Complement can be used to automatically assign the last probability value of the table. This takes into account the constraint that the probabilities of an event must sum to one. This way, the user can only manually specify n− 1 entries of the table.

This learning process can be computed using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (Section 3.2.1) if the log of events is complete or using the EM Clustering algorithm if the log of events is incomplete (Bishop 2007).\nIn the scope of this work, since we were given a complete event log, the process of filling the conditional probability tables was given by the maximum likelihood estimation, that is, by counting the\nnumber of times each instance of the log of events was present and then by normalizing to obtain a probability value.\nSamIam can automatically do this in the query mode. In the main SamIam interface, one can select the query mode just like presented in Figure 22. To go into the learning menu, one needs to find the option EM Learning (Figure 23).\nUnder the EM Learning menu, the user is presented with a window that asks for a training file, a probability threshold, the maximum number of iterations that the algorithm should perform and if the learning algorithm should ignore entries that lead to divisions by zero. Figure 24 illustrates these options.\nIn Figure 24, the field Max iterations corresponds to the total number of iterations that the EM Clustering should perform in case the algorithm does not converge. For the scope of this work, this entry is irrelevant since we are dealing with fully observed log of events. Consequently, the EM Clustering\nwill collapse to the Maximum Likelihood Estimate.\nThe field Log-likelihood threshold is also used in the scope of the EM Clustering. This threshold specifies that the algorithm will converge when the change in the log-likelihood function falls bellow a certain threshold. It is a common practice in the literature to set this value to 0.05 (Bishop 2007, Koller & Friedman 2009).\nThe option Use bias to prevent divisions by zero should always be used, otherwise the Maximum Likelihood Estimate formula will try to perform a division by zero when it tries to compute the probability of an instance that does not exist in the training set.\nIn process mining, a training set consists in a portion of the log of events that is used to fit (train) a model for prediction of values. In the scope of this work, a training set will consist of 70% randomized entries of the log of events. The format of the training file contains the names of all random variables (nodes) in the first line. The remaining lines of the file correspond to the instances of the nodes that are specified in the log of events. In this work, we modeled binary random variables with the instances present to represent the occurrence of a task in the business process and absent to represent the nonexistence of the task. Figure 25 shows the log of events (left) and the conversion of one instance of the log of events into a training file with the SamIan format (right).\nAfter SamIam learns the conditional probability tables, it is necessary to correct some semantics of the network. More specific the inclusion of mutually exclusive relationships. For instance, Figure 26 presents a conditional probability table that was automatically learned by SamIam. As one can see, when the node A PARTLYSUBMITTED is absent, SamIam did not update the normal probability distribution, so the probabilities 0.5 remained in the conditional probability table. This means that there were no events in the log that did not have an instance of the A PARTLYSUBMITTED node. This happens, because in process mining, the activities that are performed are usually mutually exclusive, unless a special structure is used to say the contrary. In order to correct these probabilities, such that the mutual exclusion is captured, one just needs to fill the conditional probability table just like illustrated in Figure 27. When the preceding node is absent, then the posterior nodes should also become absent."

This example shows a network of the following form: C← A→ B.\nIn a first attempt, we mapped the entire log of events into a Bayesian Network. However, the full log contained many tasks (about 24 random variables) and turned the process too big and complex to analyse. Figure 30 shows the network directly extracted from the log of events. The cycles that are present in this network were already expected, since the log of events contain many events that require cycles. Later in this work, we will specify an heuristic to remove such cyclic structures and turn any network into an acyclic directed graph.\nSince the network in Figure 30 was too complex, we decided to choose only the nodes concerned with the A tasks of the log of events, just like it was done in the works of (Adriansyah & Buijs 2012, Bautista et al. 2012, Bose & van der Aalst 2012, Kang et al. 2012).\nThe resulting Bayesian Network was smaller, containing only 10 random variables. We then altered the Bayesian Network in order to add mutually exclusive relationships between the nodes A DECLINED and A CANCELLED and between the nodes A APPROVED, A DECLINED and A CANCELLED.\nThe mutually exclusive relation between the nodes A DECLINED and A CANCELLED is straightforward. A loan application cannot be both declined and cancelled. Additionally, if an application is known to be declined, then the probability of being cancelled will be zero and vice-versa. Figure 31 presents this network and Figures 32 to 34 illustrate the mutual exclusion between nodes.\nIn order to compare our model with other works in the literature, we also created a Markov Chain from the same log of events (Section 2).

The validation was performed as follows: we computed the probability of some events occurring in the test set and then we compared this value with the probability given in the trained Bayesian Network. Tables 2 to 8 show the results obtained for different queries both in the test set and the training set.\nThe overall results show that the Bayesian Network learned from the log of events is a good approach for process mining, since the errors obtained were very low. The most significant errors come associated with the node A CANCELLED. For instance, in Table 5, the probability Pr( A CANCELLED = present | A PREACCEPT ) achieved an error of 17%. One possible explanation can be given by the mutual exclusivities that were given to this node. Since in Bayesian Networks, all nodes depend of each other,"

In the end, those probabilities were weighted with the number of occurrences of each sequence in the test set. The results obtained are discriminated in Table 10.\nTable 10 shows that the probabilities computed in a Bayesian Network are almost identical to the ones computed by the Markov Chain. Individually, the probabilities of computing the sequences in the test set did not have an error percentage superior to 4.13%, which is statistically insignificant given the total amount of data tested. Moreover, the overall error percentage between the proposed Bayesian Network and the Markov Chain was around 1.2674%, which is also statistically insignificant. This"

      "text" : "As already mentioned, one of the capabilities of Bayesian Networks for process mining is their ability to deal with uncertainty. They enable the analysis of tasks that are not known to occur. For instance, for the Loan Application Bayesian Network, one can be interested in analyzing the probability of the business process ending successfully by only knowing that a couple of tasks were observed to occur. Combining this ability with SamIam’s graphical capabilities will enable a fast analysis of business processes as well as risk management.\nFigure 36 shows the probabilities of some nodes of the Loan Application Bayesian Network, when it is only known that the application was declined, that is, the node A DECLINED was observed to occur. From this analysis, one can conclude that the majority of the applications that are declined have a high probability of reaching the state A PREACCEPT. Moreover, if an application is declined, then the nodes A ACTIVATED and A CANCELLED are never reached.\nAnother example is given by Figure 37. When it is known that the application ended up in a cancelled state, then one can estimate with a 100% probability that the process reached the task A PREACCEPT and never reached the tasks A DECLINED and A ACTIVATED. Moreover, there is a high probability that the application was cancelled during the tasks A ACCEPTED and A FINALIZED.\nThe maximum uncertainty in the loan application business process is given when one only knows\nthat the process was started, which happens when the task A SUBMITTED is observed to occur. In this situation, the proposed Bayesian Network estimates that there is a high probability of the process going to the task A PREACCEPT or being declined (A DECLINED). If one chooses task A PREACCEPT, then from Figure 39 one can conclude that there is a high probability that the process will be either accepted or finalised."

More specifically, Bayesian Networks enable the reconstruction of a flow by only taking into account partial observations in the business process.\nAs for future work, it would be interesting to extend the capabilities of Bayesian Networks to learn from incomplete logs of events. One could train such network using the EM Clustering in order to find an approximate probability distribution for the occurrence of the tasks. Moreover, together with SamIam, one could try to estimate the most probable sequences of business processes using the probabilities learned from the incomplete log."

Several models have been proposed to address this problem, however, here we propose a different approach to deal with uncertainty. By uncertainty, we mean estimating the probability of some sequence of tasks occurring in a business process, given that only a subset of tasks may be observable. In this sense, this work proposes a new approach to perform process mining using Bayesian Networks. These structures can take into account the probability of a task being present or absent in the business process. Moreover, Bayesian Networks are able to automatically learn these probabilities through mechanisms such as the maximum likelihood estimate and EM clustering. Experiments made over a Loan Application Case study suggest that Bayesian Networks are adequate structures for process mining and enable a deep analysis of the business process model that can be used to answer queries about that process.",
