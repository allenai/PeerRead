      "text" : "Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) is an aircraft with no onboard pilot which can be remote controlled or fly autonomously based on pre-programmed flight plans with complex dynamic automation systems. Optimizing air to ground operations of such air vehicles is an important decision making problem [7]. A more challenging scenario is multiple UAVs required to service geographically dispersed targets. Multiple tasks are required to be successively performed on each target, viz. targets to be classified, attacked and damage inflicted on targets must be assessed. The floating time constraints are critical. A target cannot be attacked before it is classified and UAV sent to target area only after target attack has been executed. Multi role UAVs are considered such that each UAV can perform all tasks. Small UAVs such as autonomous Wide Area Search Munitions (WASM) are deployed in groups from aircraft flying at higher altitudes. They are individually capable of autonomous searching, recognizing and attacking targets. The ability to network involving communication of target information to one another and consequent co-operation greatly improves effectiveness of future UAV teams. The problem comprises of planning performance of UAVs’ tasks such that critical timing constraints are satisfied. This calls for optimal assignment and scheduling [1].\nIn a time phased network optimization model was used to perform task allocation for team of UAVs [9]. The model is run simultaneously on all air vehicles at discrete points in time and assigns each vehicle one or more tasks each time it is executed. The network optimization model is iteratively implemented such\nthat all known targets are prosecuted by resulting allocation. The model is solved each time new information is brought in the system, because a new target has been discovered or known target’s status is changed, thus achieving feedback action. Classification, attack and battle damage assessment tasks can all be assigned to different vehicles when a target is found resulting in target being more quickly serviced. A single vehicle can be given multiple task assignments to be performed in succession if that is more efficient than having multiple vehicles perform tasks individually. In [9], variable path lengths are included to guarantee that feasible trajectories calculated for all tasks. This method is computationally efficient and scales well. However, the iterative procedure is heuristic and suboptimal. Tabu Search can be used to solve difficult combinatorial optimization problems such as vehicle routing problem with fixed time windows [2], [3], [4], [5], [11].\nIn this work, a solution method for AV routing combinatorial optimization problem with floating time windows from Indian Air Force is developed. The work addresses optimal formulation for solving coupled multiple-assignment and scheduling problem. Time variables used are continuous in nature. They are modeled using fuzzy membership functions to tackle the inherent uncertainty involved. This leads to the formulation of AV optimization problem as Fuzzy Mixed Integer Linear Programming (FMILP) problem [8], [12] and allows optimal solution to be obtained while satisfying all time constraints. The entire FMILP problem formulation is developed using MATLAB. The mathematical formulation presented can be used to solve optimally for some realistic problem sizes. The method presented here allows staged departure times before vehicles begin their tour of targets and tasks. FMILP formulation is flexible enough to allow consideration of different cost functions such as, mission completion in minimum time, shortest total path lengths travelled by vehicles or maximization of number of AV that survive the mission. The method also accommodates fixed time windows as in vehicle routing problem [2], [5], [11]. FMILP formulation also incorporates dynamic and logical constraints on task performance as in scheduling problems [7]. Without using fixed time windows, feasibility is guaranteed as long as number of air vehicles exceeds number of targets, even with three or more tasks per target provided air vehicles have sufficient endurance.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section 2, UAV optimization problem is given. This is followed by mathematical formulation of AV optimization problem in section 3. In the next section, experimental results are given. In section 5, a discussion on problem size is illustrated. Finally, in section 6 conclusions are given."

As input increases from ijc , membership function value decreases to 0 at + + ijij bc and\nremains at 0 for all inputs greater than +\n+ ijij bc . The obvious choice of this membership function arises\nbecause there is only one output here viz. time.\nThe time to travel from node i to node j depends on particular AV sv' airspeed and assigned task k .\nThree tasks must be performed on each target viz. (a) classification (b) attack (c) target damage assessment (verification). Furthermore, once an AV attacks a target, it is destroyed and can no longer perform additional tasks. This is certainly the case for powered munitions and WASM mission, but if AV was a reusable aircraft, the problem formulation would have to be modified and account for AV’s depletion of its store of ammunition following each attack. Three tasks must be performed on each target in order listed. This results in critical timing constraints. The problem inherits some aspects of job shop scheduling [7].

Of these 3 + nm + 1 are continuous timing variables and rest is binary decision variables. The number of constraints also grows rapidly. There are 12 (n – 1) nw + 9nw + 2nwm + 2nm + 3w constraints, of which mn + w are equality constraints and 7nw + 2w inequality non-timing constraints and 12 (n – 1) nw + 2nw + 2nwm + mn inequality timing constraints. The size of FMILP increases rapidly as problem size increases. Some practical sized problems are amenable to optimal solution with this formulation. For n = 2, w = 3, there are 51 binary decision variables, 10 continuous decision variables, 9 linear equality constraints and 174 linear inequality constraints. For n = 2, w = 4, there are 68 binary decision variables, 11 continuous decision variables, 10 linear equality constraints and 230 linear inequality constraints. For n = 2, w = 5, there are 85 binary decision variables, 12 continuous decision variables, 11 linear equality constraints and 286 linear inequality constraints. For n = 3, w = 4, there are 136 binary decision variables, 14 continuous decision variables, 13 linear equality constraints and 485 linear inequality constraints. The growth of constraints and variables is linear in number of vehicles but quadratic in number of targets. For many operational scenarios involving large problem sizes optimal solutions cannot be found within available computation time and the problem becomes intractable in nature leading to NP Complete problem."

      "text" : "In this work, FMILP model is presented to find an optimal solution to NP Complete complex multiple task assignment and scheduling problem where tasks are coupled by timing and task precedence constraints. With due consideration to linearity and inherent uncertainty in real life data involved, AV optimization problem is formulated as FMILP by treating the time variable as continuous one. The mathematical formulation allows staged AV departure times to guarantee that time constraints are satisfied and incorporate varying task completion times into optimization model. Here feasibility is guaranteed provided that number of UAVs employed exceeds number of targets and UAV endurance is sufficiently high. The formulation is flexible enough to allow for various alternative performance functionals. The rigorous formulation allows true optimal solution for challenging assignment and scheduling problem. Experimental results are presented for practical real life problem from Indian Air Force which demonstrates the efficiency of FMILP problem formulation. The solution developed can serve as an effective heuristic for different categories of AV optimization problems."

Associated multiple tasks viz., target classification, attack and verification are successively performed on each target. The optimal minimum time performance of these tasks requires cooperation among vehicles such that critical time constraints are satisfied i.e. target must be classified before it can be attacked and AV is sent to target area to verify its destruction after target has been attacked. Here, optimal task scheduling problem from Indian Air Force is formulated as Fuzzy Mixed Integer Linear Programming (FMILP) problem. The solution assigns all tasks to vehicles and performs scheduling in an optimal manner including scheduled staged departure times. Coupled tasks involving time and task order constraints are addressed. When AVs have sufficient endurance, existence of optimal solution is guaranteed. The solution developed can serve as an effective heuristic for different categories of AV optimization problems.",
