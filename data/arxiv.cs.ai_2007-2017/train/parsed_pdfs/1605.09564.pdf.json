      "text" : "Specialized dictionaries (Caruso, 2011) and domain-specific taxonomies are useful for describing the specific way a language is used in a domain, and for general applications such as domain-specific annotation or classification. To create a specialized dictionary, it is first necessary to determine the characteristic vocabulary to be included. These are words that are either specific to the domain, or common words that have specialized usages within the domain. Recent advances using machine learning in natural language processing have led to the development of distributional semantic tools, such as word2vec, which use unsupervised training over a large corpus of text to embed words in an N-dimensioned vector space (Goldberg and Levy, 2014). These vectors have the desirable property that words that are substitutable, or found in similar contexts, have vectors that are close together in this vector space, and using a distance function, such as cosine distance, reveals words which are semantically similar or related to a given word, or words. To discover the characteristic vocabulary of a domain, it is interesting to see what words are semantically related within that domain. Since the semantic relationships are learned from an underlying corpus, it seems evident that the corpus should be drawn from texts concerning the domain. As a general solution, we have created a directed crawler to build a corpus for any given domain. From this corpus, we can extract the characteristic vocabulary for the domain, and build more complex lexical structures such as taxonomies.\nHere, in this article, we present the various pieces that can be assembled to create specialized vocabularies and domainspecific taxonomies. In the next section, we describe how this\ncrawler works. This is followed by a description of one distributional semantics tool, word2vec. Then we show how these two tools can be used together to extract the basis of a specialized vocabulary for a domain."

      "heading" : "2. Building a Directed Crawler",
      "text" : "A directed crawler is a web crawler for gathering text corresponding to a certain subject. A web crawler is a program that continuously fetches web pages, starting from a list of seed URLs1. Each web page fetched contributes new URLs which are added to the list of the remaining URLs to be crawled. A directed crawler (Chakrabarti et al. 1999) only adds new URLs to this list if the fetched web page passes some filter, such as being written in a given language, or containing certain key words.\nIn our directed crawler, we begin our crawl using a list of seed URLs from the Open Directory Project2 (ODP) whose crowdsourced classification of web pages has been used in many lexical semantic projects (e.g., Osiński and Weiss, 2004; Lee at al, 2013; Ševa et al., 2015). To gather the seed list, we send a query concerning the topic of interest, e.g., Fibromyalgia3, and extract the first 40 URLs returned by the query4. These URLs stored in a ToCrawl list.\nThe crawler iterates over this ToCrawl list, taking the first URL from the list, fetching the corresponding web page with the Unix lynx package5, and then removing the URL from ToCrawl. We do not fetch the same page twice during the crawl, nor more than 100 pages from the same website.\nThe textual content of the fetched web page is extracted (by the program delynx.awk, see release). The page is roughly divided into sentences (sentencize.awk), and sentences with at least three English words in a row are retained (quickEnglish.awk). Finally, in order to perform the filtering part of the directed crawl, only those pages which contain one or more patterns found in the Patterns file are retained. In our released code, the Patterns contains upper and lowercase versions of the topic\n1 URL stands for Universal Resource Locator. URLs most\ncommonly begin with http://… and ftp://… 2 http://dmoz.org. There are almost 4 million URLs indexed in\nthe ODP catalog, tagged with over 1 million categories. It can be used under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported licence\n3 https://www.dmoz.org/search?q=Fibromyalgia 4 Code found at https://www.lri.fr/~ggrefens/GLOBALEX/ 5 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(web_browser)\nname (e.g. Fibromyalgia, fibromyalgia). Retained pages are copied into a GoodText directory, and the new URLs found in the retained page (by the delynx.awk program) are appended to the ToCrawl list. Every time one hundred pages are crawled, the ToCrawl list is randomly mixed. The crawl ends when a predefined number of retained pages (e.g., 1000) are found. Collecting 1000 pages for a given topic, using the code delivered, takes around 3 hours on the average.\nWe have crawled text for 158 autoimmune illnesses6, and for 266 hobbies7, in view of creating taxonomies of terms for each topic (Grefenstette, 2015a). Here we will show how to use the distributional semantics tools in word2vec to explore these domain-specific corpora, and then show how we build a loose taxonomy automatically."
    }, {
      "heading" : "3. Word2vec",
      "text" : "Words that appear in similar contexts are semantically related. This is the Distributional Hypothesis (Harris, 1954; Firth 1957). Implementations of this hypothesis have a long history computational linguistics. To find semantically similar nouns using parsed context, Hindle (1990) compared nouns using their frequencies as arguments of verbs as context for comparison, and Ruge (1991) used the frequencies of other words in noun phrases. Frequency of other syntactic relations were used later (Grefenstette, 1994; Lin, 1998), including frequency of appearance in the same lists (Kilgarriff at al., 2004).\nIn one of the earliest approaches to embedding words in a reduced, fixed-length semantic space, Latent Semantic Indexing (Deerwester et al., 1990) first represented each word by a vector in which each cell value corresponded to the number of times a word appears in a document in some collection. The number of documents in the corpus defined the length of the initial vector. A matrix compression technique, singular value decomposition, allowed them to replace the original word vectors by much shorter, fixed-length vectors (for example, vectors of 100 dimensions). These shorter vectors, or embeddings as they are often called now, can be used to recreate the original larger vector with minimal loss of information. As a secondary effect, words whose embeddings are close together, using a cosine measure, for example, to measure the distance, have been found to be semantically similar, as if the singular value matrix reduction mechanism captures some type of “latent semantics.”\nWord2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) and GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) are two recent tools, among many others (Yin and Schütze, 2015), for creating word embeddings. In word2vec, using the continuous bag of words setting, word embedding vectors are created by a neural net which tries to guess which word appears in the middle of a context (for example, given the four words preceding and following the word to guess). Using another setting skip-grams, the neural net tries to predict the words that appear around a given word. In either case, initial, random word embeddings are gradually altered by the gradient descent mechanism of neural nets, until a stable set is found. Levy and Goldberg (2014) have proved that, with a large number of dimensions in the embedding vectors, and enough iterations, word2vec approximates Pointwise Mutual 6 http://www.aarda.org/research-report/ Crawling the 158\ntopics took about 2 weeks using one computer. 7 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hobbies\nInformation (Church and Hanks, 1989; Tunery and Pantel, 2010). Word2vec produces “better” results, since it implements other hyperparameters such as generating negative contextual examples, which push unrelated vectors farther apart, and sampling among the positive examples, ignoring some cases, which helps to generalize the vectors since they are not limited to exact contexts (Levy at al., 2015).\nWord2vec is memory-efficient and easy-to-use. The code is downloadable from https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/ and it includes scripts for running a number of large scale examples, out of the box. For example, a word2vec script called demoword.sh will download the first 17 million words of Wikipedia and create short embedded vectors for the 71,000 words appearing 5 times or more, in under fifteen minutes on a laptop computer."

      "heading" : "4. Combining a directed crawl and word2vec",
      "text" : "Once a domain specific corpus has been crawled (section 2), word2vec can be applied to create fixed size word vectors. The input corpus can be transformed by removing all alphanumeric characters, and transposing uppercase characters to lowercase. This is the case of demo programs delivered in the word2vec packages, where, in addition ,all numbers are spelled out as digits (e.g., 19 is written as “one nine”) before the word\nembedding vectors are trained. Once the vectors are built, one can find the closest words to any word using the distance program in the package. For example, using word vectors built from a 750,000 word corpus for fibromyalgia, we find the following words closest to Fibromyalgia. The closest the cosine distance is to one, the nearer are the words:\nNearest words to Fibromyalgia Cosine distance pain 0.573297 symptoms 0.571838 fatigue 0.545525 chronic 0.542895 mysterious 0.517179 fms 0.514373 syndrome 0.514127 cached 0.508570 treatment 0.505819 georgia 0.495497 cfs 0.492857 overview 0.492563 referrals 0.491843 diet 0.487120 condition 0.485280 specialists 0.470644 mcgee 0.467879 comprehensive 0.462546 chronicfatigue 0.462226 fibro 0.459657 constellation 0.459147 perplexing 0.454235 checklist 0.441451 pinpoint 0.441292 webmd 0.441237 controversial 0.440630 conditions 0.438186 fm 0.437467\nFibromyalgia is “a rheumatic condition characterized by muscular or musculoskeletal pain with stiffness and localized tenderness at specific points on the body” and many of the words identified by word2vec concern its symptoms (pain, fatigue, , constellation [of symptoms]) or synonyms (fibro, fms, chronic-fatigue, fm) or its characteristics (mysterious, chronic, perplexing, controversial) or its treatment (treatment, referrals, specialists, webmd, diet). In order to expand this list, we can find the closest words to each of the 10 most frequent words of length 6 or more:\nacceptance, accompanying, aerobic, ailment, amen, anger, anxiety, approach, approaches, appt, arthritic, arthritis-related, biking, bipolar, bloggers, blogspot, brochure, cached, care, cat, cause, causes, celiac, cfs, characterized, cherokeebillie, chronic, clinically, com, common, comprehensive, concurrent, condition, conditioning, conditions, conducted, considerable, constellation, contributing, cortisol, costochondritis, cycles, degenerative, dementia, depressive, dermatomyositis, discomfort, discusses, disease, diseases, disorder, disorders, disturbance, doc, docs, doctors, documentary, dysthymia, ehlers-danlos, elevated, emedicine, emotions, encephalomyelitis, endocrinologist, everydayhealth, excluded, exercises, exercising, exertion,\nexisting, experiencing, expertise, explanations, extent, fatigue, fetus, fibromyalgia, finance, fiona, fischer, flexibility, flu-like, fms, fmsni, focused, frontiers, funding, georgia, guardian, hallmark, hashimoto, hashimotos, healthcare, health-care, homocysteine, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, hypothyroidmom, … , situations, someecards, sought, specialist, sponsors, statistics, stretching, studies, study, subjective, substantial, sufferers, surrounding, swimming, symptomatic, symptoms, syndrome, syndromes, temporary, testosterone, therapy, transforming, treatment, treatments, truths, tsh, underactive, undiagnosed, unrefreshing, valuable, variant, walking, warranty, wealth, websites, wellness, widespread, worsen\nTo demonstrate that it is better to use word2vec with a domain specific corpus, rather than a general corpus, consider Tables 1 and 2. In these tables, we compare the closest words found to “pain” and to “examination” in two general corpora, a 10 billion word newspaper corpus, and 17 million word Wikipedia corpus, to 9 domain specific corpora concerning illnesses gathered using the directed crawler of section 2. We see that in the domain specific corpora, the words related to pain are tailored to each illness, whereas the general corpora give words related to pain over a variety of situations. Likewise, for “examination”, we can guess from the closest words, what type of medical examinations are used for each illness, whereas the general corpora confuse the academic and judicial senses of “examination” with any medical senses."

      "text" : "Word2vec can also be used to discover the characteristic vocabulary of a domain, given a domain text, such as that crawled by a directed crawler, and a larger, background text not from the same domain. Without modifying the code of word2vec, one can make this vocabulary visible using q “trick” of inserting an explicit label inside the domain text only, and learning word vector for this explicit label. Words closest to this explicit, inserted label are those words that are most predictive of the domain label.\nHere is how we perform this insertion: 1. Take the domain corpus that has been generated by a\ndirected crawl (as described above in section 2), and remove stopwords8 and punctuation from the text. Lowercase the resulting text. 2. Insert a new uppercase label between every word in the lowercased domain text. 3. Append the domain text with its explicit label to a large background corpus of English that has been prepared as in step 1 4. Use the resulting text (i.e., domain text with its explicit label and the background text) as input to word2vec, and create new word vectors. 5. Use the distance program delivered in the word2vec package, and find the words that are closest to the uppercase explicit label as the closest words to that domain.\n8 http://www.lextek.com/manuals/onix/stopwords2.html, for\nexample"

In step 2, we insert an explicit label, for example, VVV, between each word in the domain text:\n… individuals VVV vitiligo VVV feel VVV conscious VVV appearance VVV poor VVV image VVV stems VVV fear VVV public VVV rejection VVV psychosexual VVV concerns …\nIn step 3, we append, to this domain text with the explicit labels inserted, another 34 million words coming from a widerange of English texts with stopwords excluded.\nIn step 4, this combined text is input into word2vec using the default parameters10 from the demo-word.sh script delivered in the package. This creates word embedding vectors for the 158,000 tokens appearing 5 times or more in the combined text, including our artificially inserted explicit label of step 2.\nIn step 5, we use the distance program of the word2vec package to find the 40 closest words to our artificial label:\nvitiligo, depigmented, repigmenting, leucoderma, bueckert, mequinol, grojean, re-pigmentation, benoquin, repigmentation, depigmentation, bleaching, leukotrichia, lightening, melasma, psoriasis, hair, dpcp, lighten, basc, tacalcitol, complexion, complexions, tanned, camouflage, tattooing, depigmentary, dermablend, de-pigmented, radmanesh, freckle, melanocytes, maquillage, plucking, protopic, eumelanin, alopecia, tans, avrf, leucotrichia\nWe can expand this list, like in a spreading activation net, by looking for the 5 or 10 closest words to each of these words close to the artificial label.

We also implement the string inclusion hypothesis, i.e., a subterm of a long term is the hypernym of the longer term. These two strategies were sufficient to place first in the SemEval 2015 Taxonomy task (Grefenstette, 2015b). These two strategies produce a pairwise ordering of retained terms as hypernyms and hyponyms. Here are some examples of these pairings for the Vitiligo domain (words are still stemmed at this point):\nphototherapi>narrowband uvb phototherapi>narrowband uvb treatment phototherapi>ongo repigment phototherapi>parsad phototherapi>partner phototherapi>perilesion skin pigment>caus skin pigment>caus whitish patch pigment>cell call melanocyt pigment cell>melanogenesi\nWe place the domain term (used to begin the crawl described in section 2) at the root of taxonomy, and place other terms under this root, maintaining order and avoiding loops. We also “unstem” the stemmed terms by producing all variants attested in the original crawled domain corpus. This produces an output such as the following, where the hypernymy relation is expressed using the great-than sign (>):\nvitiligo>basal cell carcinoma>superficial basal cell carcinoma vitiligo>bb uvb>targeted bb uvb vitiligo>bleaching>skin bleaching\nvitiligo>blotches>causes blotches vitiligo>calcipotriene>calcipotriene ointment vitiligo>called melanocytes>cells called melanocytes vitiligo>called melanocytes>white patches appear vitiligo>camouflage>camouflage creams vitiligo>camouflage>skin camouflage vitiligo>camouflage>traditional skin camouflage vitiligo>causing depigmentation>medical condition causing depigmentation\nWe use these automatically generated taxonomies to annotate user generated text in our personal information system that we are building11."

The first step in creating a specialized dictionary involves detecting the characteristic vocabulary of the domain in question. Classical methods for detecting this vocabulary involve gathering a domain corpus, calculating statistics on the terms found there, and then comparing these statistics to a background or general language corpus. Terms which are found significantly more often in the specialized corpus than in the background corpus are candidates for the characteristic vocabulary of the domain. Here we present two tools, a directed crawler, and a distributional semantics package, that can be used together, circumventing the need of a background corpus. Both tools are available on the web.",
