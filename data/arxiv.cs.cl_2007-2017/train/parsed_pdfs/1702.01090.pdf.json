      "text" : "Just as Britain and America have been described as two nations separated by a common language, different academic disciplines often use the same words with divergent meanings [1]. Interdisciplinary research thus poses unique challenges for information retrieval (IR). Word sense disambiguation [2, 3], differing publication practices across disciplines [4–6] and disjoint authorship networks [7] pose special challenges to information retrieval for interdisciplinary work. When the dimension of time is added, terminological shifts [8, 9], changing citation standards [10–13], and shifting modes of scholarly communication [4, 5, 14, 15] all amplify the challenges for IR to serve the need of interdisciplinary scholars.\nWidespread digitization of monographs and journals by HathiTrust [16, 17] and Google Books [18, 19] enable new longitudinal studies of change in language and discourse [8, 9, 12, 20–22], an approach known as “distant reading” [23]. These data-driven distant readings contrast with “close readings”, in which short passages and particular details are emphasized for scholarly interpretation. Newly digitized materials, which enable distant reading, differ from born-digital scholarly editions in three key ways: First, the reliance on optical character recognition (OCR) over scanned page images introduces noise into the plain-text representations of the text. Second, the unstructured text does not contain any markup that may differentiate page header and footer information, section headings, or bibliographic information from the main text. Finally, metadata is often automatically extracted and lacks the provenance information important to many humanities scholars. Researchers seeking to marry these “distant readings” to more traditional “close readings” are impacted by these factors [24].\nOur goal is to develop computational methods for scholarly analysis of large-scale digital collections that are robust across both the technological inconsistency of the digitized materials and the variations of meaning and practice among fields and across time. A further goal of our approach is that these methods should inform interdisciplinary research by suggesting novel interpretations and hypotheses. These methods should support scholars who wish to drill down from high level overviews of the available materials to specific pages and sentences that are relevant for understanding the various responses of scientists to contentious issues within their fields.\nIn this paper, we focus on meeting these challenges within the interdisciplinary field of history and philosophy of science (HPS). HPS must not only bridge the humanities and the sciences, but also the temporal divide between historically-significant materials and the present [25–28]. We show how faceted search using a combination of traditional classification systems and mixed-membership models can move beyond keyword search to inform resource\ndiscovery, hypothesis formulation, and argument extraction in our test domain, delivering methods that can be generalized to other domains.\nUsing a novel approach of drill-down topic-modeling, we demonstrate how a set of 1,315 fulltext volumes obtained by a keyword search from the HathiTrust digital library is reduced to 6 focal volumes that did not appear in the top 10 HathiTrust search results. Topic modeling of these volumes at various levels, from whole book down to individual sentences, provides the contexts for word-sense disambiguation, is relatively robust in the face of OCR errors, and ultimately supports a system for semi-automatic identification of argument structure. We show how visualizations designed for macroanalysis of disciplinary scientific journals can be extended to highlight interdisciplinarity in arguments from book data [29]. This guides researchers to passages important for the kind of “close reading” that lies at the heart of scholarly work in the humanities, supporting and augmenting the interpretative work that helps us understand the intellectual and societal contexts in which scientific writings are produced and received.\nWhile the extension of computational methods to various questions in the humanities may eventually provide ways to test specific hypotheses, the main focus of such research is likely to remain exploratory and interpretative, in keeping with the humanities themselves [24, 30]. This approach nevertheless shares something with the sciences: it is experimental to the extent that it opens up a space of investigation within which quantitatively defined parameters can be systematically varied and results compared. Such exploratory experimentation is common not just in the social sciences, but also in the natural sciences [31, 32].\nOur study consisted of six stages. (1) We used a keyword search of the HathiTrust collection to generate an initial search space for the faceted search. (2) We constructed probabilistic topic models for the volumes in the initial search results. This model is a type of mixed-membership model, which captures the multiple contexts of the selected volumes and allows us to reduce the original search space even further. Topic models are also a type of bag-of-words model, making them well-suited for the unstructured text found in the HT. (3) Third, we used drill-down topic modeling to construct page-level models of the reduced set of volumes selected at the previous stage. (4) Using the page-level results to select pages for close-reading analysis, we thus supported semi-automatic argument extraction to showcase the interpretive results of our search process. (5) We exploited the close reading of arguments for exploratory investigation of sentence-level topic modeling in a single volume. (6) We used scientific mapping to find relevant volumes [33]. As current science maps represent journal data and data overlays are created based on journal names, we used a classification crosswalk from the UCSD Map of Science to the Library of Congress Classifications of these journals, allowing us to project books onto the science map."

As of October 24, 2016, it consisted of over 14.7 million volumes represented both as raw page images and OCR-processed text1.\nDue to copyright concerns, access is given only to pre-1928 materials, which are assumed to be in the public domain in the United States.2 When the work described in this paper was initiated in 2012, the public domain portion of the HathiTrust consisted of approximately 300,000 volumes. At the end of the funding period in 2014, the public domain consisted of 2.1 million volumes. That number is now 5.7 million volumes, as of October 24, 2016.\nWhile the corpus size has increased 20-fold, the methods presented in this paper are aimed to reduce the portion of the corpus for analysis. For example, the first step described below is keyword search, with our initial results returning 1,315 volumes (referred to as the HT1315 corpus). Using the same query on October 24, 2016, we returned 3,497 volumes. Both of these datasets are computationally-tractable on modern workstations, in contrast to (for example) the 1.2 terabyte HTRC Extracted Features Dataset, derived from 4.8 million volumes [35].\nFrom the HT1315 corpus, we selected 86 volumes to model at the page-level (the HT86 corpus). This corpus was then further reduced to a 6-volume collection for argument mapping (HT6)."

We aimed to identify and extract arguments about anthropomorphism from a relevant subset of the scientific works published in the late 19th and early 20th century. This period represents a critical time for the development of comparative psychology, framed at one end by the work of Charles Darwin and at the other end by the rise of the behaviorist school of psychology (see [42] for a full historical review). Using the methods described in this paper, we progressively narrowed the 300,000 volumes to a subset of 1,315 selected for topic modeling at the full-volume level, then 86 of these selected for page-level topic modeling, and then 6 specific volumes selected for manual analysis of the arguments.\nThe term “anthropomorphism” itself illustrates the problem of word sense disambiguation. In the theological context, anthropomorphism refers to the attribution of human-like qualities to gods. In the animal cognition context, it refers to the projection of human psychological properties to animals. Given the theological controversy evoked by Darwin, our inquiry demands our system be robust in partitioning these separate discourses."

Notably, it took Charles Darwin 23 years to read a number of books comparable in size to HT1315, as documented in his Reading Notebooks [43]. Even at the unlikely rate of one book a day, it would take nearly four years to read this set of books in its entirety. About one fifth of the volumes retrieved were course catalogs, but even eliminating those would leave a daunting, if not quite Olympian, reading task. As the majority of the volumes selected by keyword search were not directly relevant to the research project, the potential payoff made possible by more sophisticated computational analysis of the full texts is critical for information retrieval tasks.\n3A list of titles and HT handles is provided in the supplemental materials. Because the HT collection has changed over time, this exact set of results cannot be recreated by doing the same keyword search at hathitrust.org (see http://bit.ly/1LBbqnS).

Inspection of this list indicates that ‘anthropomorphism’ relates to a theological topic (38), a biological topic (16), a philosophical topic (51), an anthropological topic (58), etc. The topic model checking problem [44] – i.e., how to assess the quality of the model’s topics – remains an important open problem in topic modeling. Nevertheless, most of the topics in the model can be quickly summarized, with the second topic (16) being the most obvious attractor for researchers interested in comparative psychology. The second-to-last topic (1) is targeted on bibliographic citations, and is dominated by common German words that were not in the English language stop list used during initial corpus preparation.\nWe use the topic model to narrow the search by querying topics with a combination of words. We do this by finding the topic or topics with the highest sum of the probabilities for each word. For example, Table 2 shows the top ten topics returned using ‘anthropomorphism’, ‘animal’, and ‘psychology’ as input. This new query reveals two relevant topics (numbers 26 and 10) that were not returned using ‘anthropomorphism’ alone.\nSubsequently, we used all three topics (10, 16, and 26) to filter relevant books from the original set of 1,315 books. We took the cosine distance between each of the three topics to each book in HT1315. We took the sum of these three distances and filtered them at the\nthreshold of 1.25, yielding a smaller corpus of 86 volumes which we refer to as the HT86 collection.

One can consider a full volume as a single document with a particular topic distribution. However, finer-grained models can also be made, in which each page, paragraph, or sentence receives its own topic distribution.

While Kant’s name does not appear in Washburn’s book, the term ‘judgment’ is important to Kant’s theory of cognition, and fundamental to the cognitive divide he posits between humans and animals. We emphasize that this is just a speculative suggestion about Washburn’s influences, but it does show how the topic modeling process can bring certain interpretive possibilities to the fore, moving the digital humanities another step closer to the goal of generating new insight into human intellectual activity."

      "text" : "The notion of ”distant reading” [23] has captured the imagination of many in the digital humanities. But the proper interpretation of large-scale quantitative models itself depends on having a feel for the texts, similar to Barbara McClintock’s stress on having a “feeling for the organism” [52] or Richard Feynman on the importance for nascent physicists of developing “a ‘feel’ for the subject” beyond rote knowledge of the basic laws [53]. The interpretation of data and models, whether in science or the humanities, is itself (as yet, and despite a few small successes in fields such as medical diagnosis) a task at which humans vastly outperform machines. For this reason, the digital humanities remain a fundamentally hermeneutic enterprise [30], and one in which distant readings and close readings must be tightly linked if anything is to make sense.\nIn this paper we have motivated, introduced, and exemplified a multi-level computational process for connecting macro-analyses of massive amounts of documents to micro-level close reading and careful interpretation of specific passages within those documents. Thus we\nhave demonstrated how existing computational methods can be combined in novel ways to go from a high-level representation of many documents to the discovery and analysis of specific arguments contained within documents.\nWe have also shown how to zoom out to a macro-level overview of the search results. We presented a novel classification crosswalk between the Library of Congress Classification Outline (LCCO) and the UCSD Map of Science, which was constructed using only journal data, to extend the data to books. Because of the mismatch between the book data and the journal metadata, the crosswalk is not perfect, and the method of averaging locations places many books in uninterpretable regions of the map. Nevertheless, the visualization provides some useful information about the effectiveness of a simple keyword search in locating items of interest within a collection of hundreds of thousands of books.\nThat our method succeeded in discovering texts relevant to a highly specific interdisciplinary inquiry shows its robustness to inconsistent and incomplete data. The HathiTrust Digital Library had OCR errors in 2.4% of volumes as of May 2010 [54]. While the quality of the HathiTrust has increased in the intervening years, it is still a pervasive issue in digital archives [55].\nMulti-level topic modeling combined with an information-theoretic measure of distance can efficiently locate materials that are germane to a specific research project, going from more than a thousand books, to fewer than a hundred using book-level topic models, and further narrowing this set down to a small number of pages within a handful of books using page-level topic models. The similarity measure we used is mediated by the topics in the model, and because every topic assigns a probability to every word in the corpus, this approach is highly adept at finding implicit relationships among the documents. Typical applications of topic modeling, such as graphing the rise and fall of topics through time, may show large-scale trends, but do not mediate the interplay between distant reading and close reading that leads to deeper understanding. By connecting abstract, machine-discovered topics to specific arguments within the text, we have shown how topic modeling can bridge this gap."

      "text" : "The process and results of our iterative drill-down method are summarized in Figure 3, showing the reduction of the 300,000 public domain volumes in the HathiTrust in August 2012 to the HT1315 collection, to the roughly 32,000 pages in the HT86 collection, to the over 17,000 sentences of the HT6 collection, to smaller set of the 108 pages selected for close reading and argument markup. This reduction allowed us to identify key elements of late 19th\nand early 20th Century arguments about anthropomorphizing of nonhuman organisms, and to uncover the surprising taxonomic range of these arguments to include consideration even of consciousness in amoebae. The alternative approach of simply counting the occurrence of species names within these books would only have hinted at the presence of such discussions whereas, by putting words into context, topic modeling enabled researchers to zero in on passages worthy of detailed analysis and humanistic interpretation."

Our test domain is the history and philosophy of scientific work on animal mind and cognition. We demonstrate an application of our methods to the problem of identifying and extracting arguments about anthropomorphism during a critical period in the development of comparative psychology. We show how a combination of classification systems and mixed-membership models trained over large digital libraries can inform resource discovery in this domain, using methods that can be generalized to other interdisciplinary research questions. Through a novel approach of drill-down topic modeling, we are able to reduce a collection of 1,315 fulltext volumes to 6 focal volumes that did not appear in the first ten search results in the HathiTrust digital library. This ultimately supports a system for semi-automatic identification of argument structures to augment the kind of “close reading” that leads to novel interpretations at the heart of scholarly work in the humanities, drilling down from massive quantities of text to very specific passages. This multi-level view advances understanding of the intellectual and societal contexts in which writings are interpreted. 1 ar X iv :1 70 2. 01 09 0v 1 [ cs .D L ] 3 F eb 2 01 7",
