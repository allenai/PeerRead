      "text" : "This paper is about robust principal component analysis (PCA) for high-dimensional data, a topic that has drawn surging attention in recent years. PCA is one of the most widely used data analysis methods (Pearson, 1901). It constructs a low-dimensional subspace based on a set of principal components (PCs) to approximate the observations in the least-square sense. Standard PCA computes PCs as eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix. Due to the quadratic error criterion, PCA is notoriously sensitive and fragile, and the quality of its output can suffer severely in the face of even few corrupted samples. Therefore, it is not surprising that many works have been dedicated to robustifying PCA (Hubert et al., 2005; Croux\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\n& Ruiz-Gazen, 2005; Candes et al., 2009).\nAnalyzing high dimensional data – data sets where the dimensionality of each observation is comparable to or even larger than the number of observations – has become a critical task in modern statistics and machine learning (Donoho, 2000). Practical high dimensional data, such as DNA microarray data, financial data, consumer data, and climate data, easily have dimensionality ranging from thousand to billions. Partly due to the fact that extending traditional statistical tools (designed for the low dimensional case) into this highdimensional regime are often unsuccessful, tremendous research efforts have been made to design fresh statistical tools to cope with such “dimensionality explosion”.\nThe work of Xu et al. (2010a) is among the first to analyze robust PCA algorithms in the high-dimensional setup. They identified three pitfalls, namely diminishing breakdown point, noise explosion and algorithmic intractability, where previous robust PCA algorithms stumble. They then proposed the high-dimensional robust PCA (HR-PCA) algorithm that can effectively overcome these problems, and showed that HR-PCA is tractable, provably robust and easily kernelizable. In particular, in contrast to standard PCA and existing robust PCA algorithms, HR-PCA is able to robustly estimate the PCs in the high-dimensional regime even in the face of a constant fraction of outliers and extremely low Signal Noise Ratio (SNR) – the breakdown point of HR-PCA is 50%, 1 which is the highest breakdown point can ever be achieved, whereas other existing methods all have breakdown points diminishing to zero. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, HRPCA appears to be the only algorithm having these\n1Breakdown point is a robustness measure defined as the percentage of corrupted points that can make the output of the algorithm arbitrarily bad.\nproperties in the high-dimensional regime.\nBriefly speaking, HR-PCA is an iterative method which in each iteration performs standard PCA, and then randomly remove one point in a way that outliers are more likely to be removed, so that the algorithm converges to a good output. Because in each iteration, only one point is removed, the number of iterations required to find a good solution is at least as much as the number of outliers. This, combined with the fact that PCA is computationally expensive itself, prevents HR-PCA from effectively handling large-scale datasets with many outliers. In addition, the performance of HR-PCA depends on the ability of the built-in random removal to eliminate outliers correctly, which is only guaranteed in a probabilistic manner.\nTo address these two issues, we propose a deterministic high dimensional robust PCA algorithm (DHRPCA). Specifically, instead of removing one point, the proposed algorithm decreases the weights of all observations in each iteration, in a way that the total weight of the outliers will decrease faster than that of the true samples. We show that DHR-PCA inherits all desirable theoretical properties of HR-PCA, including tractability, kernelizability, the maximal breakdown point, provable performance guarantee and asymptotical optimality. Moreover, DHR-PCA can be much more computationally efficient than (randomized) HRPCA. As we show below, the number of iterations for DHR-PCA to converge is nearly constant, in sharp contrast to HR-PCA whose number of iterations required increases linearly with the number of outliers. Simulations in Section 4 show that for any fixed number of iterations, the solution to DHR-PCA is at least as good as HR-PCA, and is significantly better when the number of iterations is small. This is very appealing in practice, as both algorithms are “any-time” algorithms, i.e., one can terminate the algorithms at any time and obtain the best solution so-far."

      "heading" : "2. Related Work",
      "text" : "Besides HR-PCA, there have been abundant works on robust PCA, which we briefly discuss in this section. Robust PCA algorithms focusing on the low-dimensional setup (e.g., Rousseeuw, 1984; Croux & Ruiz-Gazen, 2005; Hubert et al., 2005) can be roughly categorized into two groups. The first group of algorithms pursue robust estimation of the covariance matrix, e.g., M -estimator (Maronna, 1976), S-estimator (Rousseeuw & Leroy, 1987), and Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) estimator (Rousseeuw, 1984). These algorithms generally provide more robust results, but their applicability\nis severely limited to small or moderate dimensions, as there are not enough observations to robustly estimate a high-dimensional covariance matrix. The second group of algorithms directly maximize certain robust estimation of univariate variance for the projected observations and then obtain maximizers as the candidate principal components (Li & Chen, 1985; Croux & Ruiz-Gazen, 1996; 2005; Hubert et al., 2002). These algorithms inherit the robustness characteristics of the adopted estimators and are qualitatively robust. However, all of these algorithms run into unsolvable issues in the high dimensional regime incurred by the curse of dimensionality as stated in the followings.\nThe targeted high-dimensional regime poses three main challenges to existing robust PCA methods. First, some robust PCA algorithms have breakdown point inversely proportional to the dimensionality, e.g., M -estimator (Maronna, 1976), in the highdimensional regime their breakdown points will diminish and the results will be arbitrarily bad in presence of even few outliers. Second, widely used outlyingness indicators, including Mahalanobis distance and StahelDonoho outlyingness (Donoho, 1982) are no longer valid, due to a phenomenon termed – “noise explosion” (Xu et al., 2010a). This causes the algorithms relying on such outlyingness measures (Hubert et al., 2005) to collapse. The third problem is that the dimensionality may be larger than the number of data points and thus some robust estimators including Minimum Volume Ellipsoid (MVE) and Minimum Covariance Determinant (MCD) (Rousseeuw, 1984) become degenerated. Furthermore, the extremely high computational complexity of these estimators and projection pursuit methods for high dimensional data prevents them from being tractable.\nFinally, we discuss recent works addressing robust PCA using low-rank technique. (Candes et al., 2009) developed a framework to perform robust PCA using low-rank matrix decomposition. Yet, their method focuses on the scenario that random entries of the observation matrix are arbitrarily corrupted, which differs from our setup where one corrupted data point may change the whole column of the observation matrix. The later setup is then investigated in Xu et al. (2010b). While their proposed method performs well under a small fraction of outliers, it breaks down for larger fraction of outliers – in particular, the breakdown point is far from 50%. Moreover, the performance scales unfavorably with the magnitude of noise, which makes it not suitable for the high-dimensional setup, due to “noise-explosion”."

      "heading" : "3.1. Problem Setup",
      "text" : "In this subsection, we present the formal problem description of PCA for the high dimensional data with contamination. Our setup, detailed below for completeness, largely follows that of Xu et al. (2010a).\nGiven n observations, there are t observations not corrupted, called authentic samples. The authentic samples zi ∈ Rm are generated through a linear mapping: zi = Axi + ni. Here, noise ni is sampled from normal distribution N (0, Im); and the signal xi ∈ Rd are i.i.d. samples of a random variable x with mean zero and variance Id. The matrix A ∈ Rm×d and the distribution µ of x are unknown. We assume µ is absolutely continuous w.r.t. the Borel measure and spherically symmetric. And µ has light tails, i.e., there exist constants K,C > 0 such that Pr(‖x‖ ≥ x) ≤ K exp(−Cx) for all x ≥ 0. We are interested in the case where n ≈ m d, i.e., the dimensionality of observations is much larger than that of signals and of the same order as the number of observations.\nThe outliers (the corrupted data) are denoted as o1, . . . ,on−t ∈ Rm and they are with arbitrary values. We only require that n− t ≤ t, i.e., the number of outliers are not more than that of authentic samples. Let λ , (n− t)/n be the fraction of corrupted points. We observe the contaminated dataset\nY , {y1, . . . ,yn} = {z1, . . . , zt} ⋃ {o1, . . . ,on−t},\nand aim to recover the principal components of A, i.e., the top eigenvectors w̄1, . . . , w̄d of AA\nT . That is, we seek a collection of orthogonal vectors w1, . . . ,wd, that maximize the following performance metric called the Expressed Variance (E.V.):\nE.V.(w1, . . . ,wd) ,\n∑d j=1 w T j AA\nTwj∑d j=1 w̄ T j AA T w̄j .\nThe E.V. represents the portion of signal Ax being expressed by w1, . . . ,wd. Thus, 1−E.V. is the reconstruction error of the signal. The E.V. is a commonly used evaluation metric for the PCA algorithms (Xu et al., 2010a; d’Aspremont et al., 2008). It is always less than one, with equality achieved by a perfect recovery, i.e., the vectors w1, . . . ,wd have the same span as the true principal components {w̄1, . . . , w̄d}.\nThe distribution µ affects the performance of the algorithms through its tail. We hence adapt the following tail weight function V : [0, 1] → [0, 1] from Xu et al. (2010a), which essentially represents how the tail of µ̄ contributes to its variance,\nV(α) , ∫ cα −cα x2µ̄(dx),\nwhere µ̄ is the one-dimensional margin of µ and cα is such that µ̄ ([−cα, cα]) = α. Notice that V(0) = 0,V(1) = 1, and V(·) is continuous."

      "text" : "Our main algorithm is given in Algorithm 1. Here, a Robust Variance Estimator (RVE) V̄t̂(·) is adopted to identify the candidate principal components. For w ∈ Sm, the RVE is defined as V̄t̂(w) , 1n ∑t̂ i=1 |wTy|2(i), where the subscript (·) denotes a non-decreasing order of the variables. And it can be seen that the RVE stands for the following statistics: project yi onto the direction w, replace the furthest n − t̂ samples by 0, and then compute the variance. If the variance is large, it is likely that a correct principal component direction is found. Otherwise, a number of points with largest variance may be corrupted. Notice that the RVE is always performed on the original observed set Y. We find that RVE coincides with the robust L-estimator, which is defined as a linear combination of order statistics: Tn = ∑n i=1 anih(x(i)) for some function h.\nWe now explain our innovation compared to HR-PCA, and its intuition. In HR-PCA, steps 4 and 5 are replaced by a random removal – the probability ŷi being\nremoved is proportional to ∑d j=1 ( wTj ŷi )2 . It has been shown in Xu et al. (2010a) that in expectation (and in probability), either the number of outliers will decrease faster, or the algorithm will find a good solution. Since in each iteration, only one point is removed, the number of iterations required to find a satisfactory output depends linearly on the number of outliers.\nInstead of resorting to a random mechanism, DHRPCA deterministically reduce the effect of corrupted data points. In particular, Moreover, DHR-PCA operates on all the data points in each iteration, which decouples the dependence of the computational cost on the number of outliers and enhances the efficiency significantly compared with HR-PCA. We consider an artificial example to illustrate this: assume both HRPCA and DHR-PCA requires M iterations for a dataset Y0. Now suppose a new data-set Y contains J identical copies of data-set Y0. Then the number of iterations for DHR-PCA remains unchanged, while HR-PCA requires JM iterations.

The proofs are shown in Section 5.\nTheorem 1. (Finite Sample Performance) Let the Algorithm 1 output {w1, . . . ,wd}. Fix a κ > 0, and let τ = max(m/n, 1). There exists a universal constant c0 and a constant C which can possibly depend on t̂/t, λ, d, µ and κ, such that for any γ < 1, if n/ log4 n ≥ log6(1/γ), then with probability 1 − γ the following holds\nE.V.{w1, . . . ,wd}\n≥\nV ( 1− λ(1+κ)(1−λ)κ )\n(1 + κ)\n× V ( t̂ t − λ 1−λ ) V ( t̂ t ) \n− 8√c0τd V ( t̂ t )  (trace(AAT ))−1/2\n−  2c0τ V ( t̂ t )  (trace(AAT ))−1 − C log2 n log3(1/γ)√ n .\nWe also consider the asymptotic performance of the proposed algorithm when the dimension and the number of data points grow together to infinity. Our asymptotic setting is similar to (Xu et al., 2010a). Suppose there exists a sequence of sample sets {Y(j)} = {Y(1),Y(2), . . .}, where Y(j), n(j),m(j), A(j), d(j), etc., denote the corresponding values of the quantities defined above, the following must hold for some positive constants c1, c2:\nlim j→∞\nn(j) m(j) = c1; d(j) ≤ c2;m(j) ↑ +∞;\ntrace ( A(j)TA(j) ) ↑ ∞. (1)\nWhile trace ( A(j)TA(j) ) ↑ ∞, if it scales slowly than√\nm(j), the SNR will asymptotically decrease to zero.\nThe last three terms in Theorem 1 go to zero as the dimension and number of points scale to infinity, i.e., as n and m→∞. Therefore, we immediately obtain: Theorem 2. (Asymptotic Performance) Given a sequence of {Y(j)}, if the asymptotic scaling in Expression (1) holds, and lim supλ(j) ≤ λ∗, then the following holds in probability when j ↑ ∞ (i.e., when n and m ↑ ∞),\nlim inf j\nE.V.{w1(j), . . . ,wd(j)}\n≥ max κ\nV ( 1− λ ∗(1+κ) (1−λ∗)κ ) (1 + κ) × V ( t̂ t − λ∗ 1−λ∗ ) V ( t̂ t )  .(2)\nObserve that when λ∗ = 0, i.e., the number of outliers scales sublinearly, the right-hand-side converges to 1 by taking κ(j) = √ λ(j), implying that the algorithm is asymptotically optimal. On the other hand, for any λ < 0.5, the right hand side is strictly positive (picking κ large enough), implying that the breakdown point converges to 50%.\nFor small λ, we can make use of the light tail condition on µ̄, to establish the following bound that simplifies (2). The proof is deferred to the supplementary material.\nCorollary 1. Under the settings of the above theorem, the following holds in probability when j ↑ ∞ (i.e., when n, p ↑ ∞),\nlim inf j\nE.V.{w1(j), . . . ,wd(j)} ≥ 1− C ′ √ αλ∗ log(1/λ∗)\nV(0.5) .\nBefore concluding this section, we remark that DHRPCA is easily kernelizable. Specifically, given a mapping function φ(·) : Rm → H and kernel function k(·, ·)\nsatisfying k(x,y) = 〈φ(x), φ(y)〉 for all x,y ∈ Rm, we can perform dimension reduction without requiring the explicit form of φ(·) in the kernel PCA (Schölkopf et al., 1997). In particular, for the centered mapped features {φ(y1), · · · , φ(yn)}, the output PCs can be represented as\nwq = n∑ j=1 aj(k)φ(ŷj).\nAnd the feature projection can be calculated by\n〈wq, φ(v)〉 = n∑ j=1 aj(q)k(ŷj ,v),\nwhere a(q) is the qth eigenvector of the kernel matrix. Note that Algorithm 1 only involves calculating 〈wq, φ(yi)〉 (in RVE evaluation) and 〈wq, φ( √ αiyi)〉 (in decreasing values of αi’s). Since the kernelization of both these two steps are obtained, the DHR-PCA algorithm can be kernelized easily."

      "text" : "We devote this section to experimentally comparing the proposed DHR-PCA with HR-PCA. Since HRPCA has shown superior robustness (against the dimensionality and number of outliers) over several robust PCA algorithms and standard PCA (Xu et al., 2010a), we skip simulations for them here.\nThe numerical study is aimed to illustrate that DHRPCA is much more efficient than HR-PCA, and meanwhile it achieves competitive performance. Here, we report the results for d = 1. We follow the data generation method in (Xu et al., 2010a) to randomly generate an m×1 matrix and then scale its leading singular value to σ. A λ fraction of outliers are generated on a line with a uniform distribution over [−σ·mag, σ·mag]. Thus, “mag” represents the ratio between the magnitude of the outliers and that of the signal Axi and is fixed as 10. The value of t̂ is set as (1 − λ)n, if λ is known exactly. Otherwise, t̂ can be simply set as 0.5n. For each parameter setup, we report the average result of 20 tests and standard deviation.\nFigure 4 shows the results form = 100, 1000 and 10000 cases respectively with σ = 5. From the figure, we can make following observations. Firstly, DHR-PCA converges much faster than HR-PCA, especially for a large number of outliers. For example, when m = 10000 and λ = 0.4, the proposed algorithm converges using less than 2 iterations in average while HR-PCA needs more than 4000 iterations to converge. Secondly, the computational time for DHR-PCA in each iteration is\nalways in the same order as HR-PCA. These results well demonstrate that DHR-PCA is much more efficient than HR-PCA.\nAs for the performance, i.e., the E.V. of the recovered PCs, Figure 4 shows that DHR-PCA performs competitively to HR-PCA. For all the cases, the E.V. of final solution of DHR-PCA is always larger than that of HR-PCA. Moreover, if we terminate both algorithms at any early iteration, DHR-PCA always perform better than HR-PCA. This is appealing in practice, as we can terminate DHR-PCA at any time and obtain a satisfactory result in practical implementation. In addition, both DHR-PCA and HR-PCA perform quite well even in presence of varying number of outliers (λ = 0.05 to 0.4) and small signal magnitude (σ = 5), which coincides with the results in (Xu et al., 2010a).\nWe then investigate the relationship between the number of iterations before convergence and the number of outliers for the two methods. As shown in Figure 2, the number of iterations taken by HR-PCA is approximately proportional to the number of corrupted points. This is not surprising, since in each iteration HR-PCA removes at most one outlier. In a stark contrast, the number of required iterations of DHR-PCA remains nearly constant, shown by the flat curve in the figures. This demonstrates that DHR-PCA has good scalability and can potentially be applied to large real applications. We provide more simulations under numerous settings in the appendix."
