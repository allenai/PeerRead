      "text" : "There has been considerable amount of work on learning when labeling is expensive, such as techniques on transductive inference and active learning. With the emergence of crowdsourcing services, like Amazon Mechanical Turk, labeling costs in many applications have dropped dramatically. Large amounts of labeled data can now be gathered at low price. Due to a lack of domain expertise and misaligned incentives, however, labels provided by crowdsourcing workers are often noisy. To overcome the quality issue, each item is usually simultaneously labeled by several workers, and then we aggregate the multiple labels with some manner, for instance, majority voting.\nAn advanced approach for label aggregation is suggested by Dawid and Skene[1]. They assume that each worker has a latent confusion matrix for labeling. The off-diagonal elements represent the probabilities that a worker mislabels an arbitrary item from one class to another while the diagonal elements correspond to her accuracy in each class. Worker confusion matrices and true labels are jointly estimated by maximizing the likelihood of observed labels. One may further assume a prior distribution over worker confusion matrices and perform Bayesian inference [2][3][4].\nThe method of Dawid-Skene (1979) implicitly assumes that a worker performs equally well across all items in a common class. In practice, however, it is often the case that one item is more difficult to label than another. To address this heterogeneous issue, Zhou et al.(2012)[5] propose a minimax entropy principle for crowdsourcing. It results in that each item is associated with a latent confusion vector besides a latent confusion matrix for each worker. Observed labels are determined jointly by worker confusion matrices and item confusion vectors through an exponential family model. Moreover, it turns out that the probabilistic labeling model can be equivalently derived from a natural assumption of objective measurements of worker ability and item difficulty. Such kinds of objectivity arguments have been widely discussed in the literature of mental test theory [6][7]. All the above approaches are for aggregating multiclass labels and In many scenarios, the labels are ordinal. Zhou et. al. (2014)[8] proposed a work to aggregate votes using minimax conditional entropy for ordinal labels.\nMost of the methods use statistical methods to aggregate the observed labels by transforming them to some probability or entropy measures. But, there has been no work that operates directly on the observed labels. We present a method to learn the aggregates of the votes using clustering. We first show the formulation that allows us to use clustering as an approximation of the vote aggregation\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n05 34\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n6 N\nov 2\n01 6\nstratagem. We first draw a parallel between the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) learning and the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm of the David-Skene algorithm and then show that Gaussian-Softmax RBMs[9] can be approximated by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), whose specific conditions lead to a direct mapping to the traditional K-means algorithm[10][11].\nTo then elucidate the clustering paradigm, we perform clustering using theK-RBM model as proposed in [14]."

      "text" : "The restricted Boltzmann machine is a bipartite, undirected graphical model with visible (observed) units and hidden (latent) units. The RBM can be understood as an MRF with latent factors that explains the input visible data using binary latent variables. The RBM consists of visible data v of dimension L that can take real values or binary values, and stochastic binary variables h of dimension K. The parameters of the model are the weight matrix W ∈ RLxK that defines a potential between visible input variables and stochastic binary variables, the biases c ∈ RL for visible units, and the biases b ∈ RK for hidden units. When the visible units are real-valued, the model is called the Gaussian RBM, and its joint probability distribution can be defined as follows:\nP (v, h) = 1\nZ exp(−E(v, h)) (1)\nE(v, h) = 1 2σ2 ||v − c||2 − 1 σ vTWh− bTh (2)\nwhere Z is a normalization constant. The conditional distribution of this model can be written as:\nP (vi|h) = N(vi;σ ∑ j Wijhj + ci, σ 2) (3)\nP (hj = 1|v) = sigm( 1\nσ ∑ i Wijvi + bj) (4)\nwhere sigm(s) = 11+exp(−s) is the sigmoid function, and N(.; ., .) is a Gaussian distribution. Here, the variables in a layer (given the other layers) are conditionally independent, and thus we can perform block Gibbs sampling in parallel. The RBM can be trained using sampling-based approximate maximum-likelihood, e.g., contrastive divergence approximation [12]. After training the RBM, the posterior (Equation 2) of the hidden units (given input data) can be used as feature representations for classification tasks."

For the GMM with arbitrary positive definite covariance matrices, we will use the shorthand notation GMM(µk,Σk).\nK-means can be understood as a special case of GMM with spherical covariance by letting σ → 0 [13]. Compared to GMM, the training of K-means is highly efficient; therefore it is plausible to train K-means to provide an initialization of a GMM. Then the GMM is trained with EM algorithm. The EM algorithm learns the parameters to maximize the likelihood of the data as described by Equation 8."

Thus, we can see that learning from RBMs are similar to aggregating votes from the Dawid-Skene algorithm which also minimizes the negative log-likelihood of the observed labels. But in the training of RBMs, we often encounter the normalization constant Z, which is intractable and this makes it difficult to train an RBM, and we need to approximate Z to learn the ideal parameters for the same. Hence, it becomes difficult to directly apply RBMs to aggregate votes."

This connection between mixture models and RBMs with a softmax constraint completes the chain of links between K-means, GMMs and Gaussian-softmax RBMs and helps us to visualize vote aggregation as a clustering problem.\nAs Equation 6 shows, the conditional probability of visible units given the hidden unit activations for Gaussian-softmax RBM follows a Gaussian distribution. From this perspective, the Gaussian-softmax RBM can be viewed as a mixture of Gaussians whose mean components correspond to possible hidden unit configurations. In this section, we show an explicit equivalence between these two models by formulating the conversion equations between GMM(µk, σ2I) with K + 1 Gaussian components and the Gaussian-softmax RBM with K hidden units.\nProposition The mixture of K + 1 Gaussians with shared spherical covariance of σ2I is equivalent to the Gaussian-softmax RBM with K hidden units.

    "abstractText" : "An important way to make large training sets is to gather noisy labels from crowds of non experts. We propose a method to aggregate noisy labels collected from a crowd of workers or annotators. Eliciting labels is important in tasks such as judging web search quality and rating products. Our method assumes that labels are generated by a probability distribution over items and labels. We formulate the method by drawing parallels between Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and show that the problem of vote aggregation can be viewed as one of clustering. We use K-RBMs to perform clustering. We finally show some empirical evaluations over real datasets.",
