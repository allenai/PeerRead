      "text" : "Residual learning [8], a novel deep learning scheme characterized by ultra-deep architectures has recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on several popular vision benchmarks. The most recent incarnation of this idea [10] with hundreds of layers demonstrate consistent performance improvement over shallower networks. The 3.57% top-5 error achieved by residual networks on the ImageNet test set arguably rivals human performance.\nBecause of recent claims [33] that networks of the AlexNet[16] type successfully predict properties of neurons in visual cortex, one natural question arises: how similar is an ultra-deep residual network to the primate cortex? A notable difference is the depth. While a residual network has as many as 1202 layers[8], biological systems seem to have two orders of magnitude less, if we make the customary assumption that a layer in the NN architecture corresponds to a cortical area. In fact, there are about half a dozen areas in the ventral stream of visual cortex from the retina to the Inferior Temporal cortex. Notice that it takes in the order of 10ms for neural activity to propagate from one area to another one (remember that spiking activity of cortical neurons is usually well below 100 Hz). The evolutionary advantage of having fewer layers is apparent: it supports rapid (100msec from image onset to meaningful information in IT neural population) visual recognition, which is a key ability of human and non-human primates [31, 28].\nIt is intriguingly possible to account for this discrepancy by taking into account recurrent connections within each visual area. Areas in visual cortex comprise six different layers with lateral and feedback connections [17], which are believed to mediate some attentional effects [2, 17, 14, 25, 12] and even learning (such as backpropagation [20]). “Unrolling” in time the recurrent computations carried out by the visual cortex provides an equivalent “ultra-deep” feedforward network, which might represent a more appropriate comparison with the state-of-the-art computer vision models.\nIn addition, we conjecture that the effectiveness of recent “ultra-deep” neural networks primarily come from the fact they can efficiently model the recurrent computations that are required by the recognition task. We show compelling evidences for this conjecture by demonstrating that 1. a deep residual network is formally equivalent to a shallow RNN; 2. such a RNN with weight sharing, thus with orders of magnitude less parameters (depending on the unrolling depth), can retain most of the performance of the corresponding deep residual network.\nFurthermore, we generalize such a RNN into a class of models that are more biologically-plausible models of cortex and show their effectiveness on CIFAR-10."

Such a dynamical systems corresponds to the feedback system of Figure 1 (B). Figure 1 (A) shows that unrolling in (discrete) time the feedback system gives a deep residual network with the same (that is, shared) weights among the layers. The number of layers in the unrolled network corresponds to the discrete time iterations of the dynamical system. The identity shortcut mapping that characterizes residual learning appears in the figure.\nThus, ResNets with shared weights can be reformulated into the form of a recurrent system. In section 5.2) we show experimentally that a ResNet with shared weights retains most of its performance (on CIFAR-10).\nA comparison of a plain RNN and ResNet with shared weights is in the Appendix Figure 11."

In a typical neural network, f is synthesized by the following relation between the activity yt of a single neuron and its inputs xt−1:\nyt = σ(〈w, xt−1〉+ b), (3)\nwhere σ is a nonlinear function such as the linear rectifier σ(·) = | · |+.\nA standard classification of dynamical systems defines the system as\n1. homogeneous if xt = 0, ∀t > 0 (alternatively the equation reads as ht+1 = f(ht;wt) with the inital condition h0 = x0)\n2. time invariant if wt = w.\nResidual networks with weight sharing thus correspond to homogeneous, time-invariant systems which in turn correspond to a feedback system (see Figure 1) with an input which is non-zero only at time t = 0 (xt=0 = x0, xt = 0 ∀t > 0) and with f(z) = (K + I) ◦ z:\nhn = f(ht;wt) = (K + I) n ◦ x0 (4)\n“Normal” residual networks correspond to homogeneous, time-variant systems.

On the other hand, one also needs a “post-net” as a postprocessor and provide supervisory signals to the recurrent system and the pre-net. The pre-net, recurrent system and post-net are trained in an end-to-end fashion with backpropagation.\nFor most models in this paper, unless stated otherwise, the pre-net is a simple 3x3 convolutional layer and the post-net is a pipeline of a batch normalization, a ReLU, a global average pooling and a fully connected layer (or a 1x1 convolution, we use these terms interchangeably).\nTake primate visual system for instance, the retina is a part of the “pre-net”. It does not receive any feedback from the cortex and thus can be separated from the recurrent system for simplicity. In Section 5.3.3, we also tried 3 layers of 3x3 convolutions as an pre-net, which might be more similar to a retina, and observed slightly better performance."

In this formulation, the transition functions\ncan vary over time (e.g., being blocked from time t1 to time t2, etc.). The increased expressive power of this formulation allows us to design a system where multiple locally recurrent systems are connected sequentially: a downstream recurrent system only receives inputs when its upstream recurrent system finishes, similar to recurrent convolutional neural networks (e.g., [19]). This system with non-shared weights can also represent exactly the state-of-the-art ResNet (see Figure 3).\nNevertheless, time-dependent dynamical systems, that is recurrent networks of real neurons and synapses, offer interesting questions about the flexibility in controlling their time dependent parameters.\nExample transition matrices used in this paper are shown in Figure 4.\nWhen there are multiple transition functions to a state, their outputs are summed together."

We use the term “readout time” to refer to the time the post-net reads the data from the last state.\nThis definition in principle allows one to have quantitive comparisons with biological systems. e.g., for a model with readout time t in this paper, the wall clock time can be estimated to be 20t to 50t ms, considering the latency of a single layer of biological neurons.\nRegarding the initial values, at t = 0 all states are empty except that the first state has some data received from the\npre-net.

This may be consistent with the observations from [18].\nHowever, good performance is restored if we apply a procedure we call a “time-specific normalization”: mean and standard deviation are calculated independently for every t (using training set). The learnable scaling and shifting parameters should be time-specific. But in most models we do not use the learnable parameters of BN since they tend not to affect the performance much.\nWe expect this procedure to benefit other RNNs trained with batch normalization. However, to use this procedure, one needs to have a initial t = 0 and enumerate all possible ts. This is feasible for visual processing but needs modifications for other tasks."

Our model is deep in all of these senses. See Section 3.2.\nRecursive Neural Networks and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks: When unfolding RNN into a feedforward network, the weights of many layers are tied.

The convolutional version was first studied by [4]. Subsequent related work includes [24] and [19]. One characteristic distinguishes our model and residual learning from Recursive NN and convolutional recurrent NN is whether there are identity shortcut mappings. This discrepancy seems to account for the superior performance of residual learning and of our model over the latters.\nA recent report [3] we became aware of after we finished this work discusses the idea of imitating cortical feedback by introducing loops into neural networks.\nA Highway Network [30] is a feedforward network inspired by Long Short Term Memory [11] featuring more general shortcut mappings (instead of hardwired identity mappings used by ResNet)."

With a 3-state models with minimum engineering, we were able to get 7.47% validation error on CIFAR-10.\n2−State Fully Recurrent NN With Different Readout Time t\nNext, for computational efficiency, we tried only allowing each state to have transitions to adjacent states and to itself by disabling bypass connections (e.g., V1-V3, V2-IT, etc.). In this case, the number of transitions scales linearly as the number of states increases, instead of quadratically. This setting performs well with 3-state networks and slightly less well with 4-state networks (perhaps as a result of small feature/parameter sizes). With only adjacent connections, the models are no longer fully recurrent.\nFinally, for 4-state fully recurrent networks, the models tend to become overly computationally heavy if we train it with large t or large number of feature maps. With small t and feature maps, we have not achieved better performance than 3-state networks. Reducing the computational cost of training multi-state densely recurrent networks would be an important future work.\nFor experiments in this subsection, we choose a moderately deep pre-net of three 3x3 convolutional layers to model the layers between retina and V1: Conv-BN-ReLU-Conv-BN-ReLU-Conv. This is not essential but outperforms shallow pre-net slightly (within 1% validation error).\nThe results are shown in Figure 9."

      "heading" : "6 Discussion",
      "text" : "The dark secret of Deep Networks: trying to imitate Recurrent Shallow Networks?\nA radical conjecture would be: the effectiveness of most of the deep feedforward neural networks, including but not limited to ResNet, can be attributed to their ability to approximate recurrent computations that are prevalent in most tasks with larger t than shallow feedforward networks. This may offer a new perspective on the theoretical pursuit of the long-standing question “why is deep better than shallow” [22, 21].\nEquivalence between Recurrent Networks and Turing Machines\nDynamical systems (in particular discrete time systems, that is difference equations) are Turing universal (the game “Life\" is a cellular automata that has been demonstrated to be Turing universal). Thus dynamical systems such as the feedback systems we discussed can be equivalent to Turing machine. This offers the possibility of representing a computation more complex than a single (for instance boolean) function with the same number of learnable parameters. Consider for instance the powercase of learning a mapping F between an input vector x and an output vector y = F (x) that belong to the same n-dimensional space. The output can be thought as the asymptotic states of the discrete dynamical system obtained iterating some map f . We expect that in many cases the dynamical system that asymptotically performs the mapping may have a much simpler structure than the direct mapping F . In other words, we expect that the mapping f such that f (n)(x) = F (x) for appropriate, possibly very large n can be much simpler than the mapping F (here f (n) means the n-th iterate of the map f).\nEmpirical Finding: Recurrent Network or Residual Networks with weight sharing work well\nOur key finding is that multi-state time-invariant recurrent networks seem to perform as well as very deep residual networks (each state corresponds to a cortical area) without shared weights. On one hand this is surprising because the number of parameters is much reduced. On the other hand a recurrent network with fixed parameters can be equivalent to a Turing machine and maximally powerful.\nConjecture about Cortex and Recurrent Computations in Cortical Areas\nMost of the models of cortex that led to the Deep Convolutional architectures and followed them – such as the Neocognitron [6], HMAX [26] and more recent models [1] – have neglected the layering in each cortical area and the feedforward and recurrent connections within each area and between them. They also neglected the time evolution of selectivity and invariance in each of the areas. The conjecture we propose in this paper changes this picture quite drastically and makes several interesting predictions. Each area corresponds to a recurrent network and thus to a\nsystem with a temporal dynamics even for flashed inputs; with increasing time one expects asymptotically better performance; masking with a mask an input image flashed briefly should disrupt recurrent computations in each area; performance should increase with time even without a mask for briefly flashed images. Finally, we remark that our proposal, unlike relatively shallow feedforward models, implies that cortex, and in fact its component areas are computationally as powerful a universal Turing machines."

    "abstractText" : "We discuss relations between Residual Networks (ResNet), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and the primate visual cortex. We begin with the observation that a shallow RNN is exactly equivalent to a very deep ResNet with weight sharing among the layers. A direct implementation of such a RNN, although having orders of magnitude fewer parameters, leads to a performance similar to the corresponding ResNet. We propose 1) a generalization of both RNN and ResNet architectures and 2) the conjecture that a class of moderately deep RNNs is a biologically-plausible model of the ventral stream in visual cortex. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the architectures by testing them on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
