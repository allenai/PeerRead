      "text" : "Constraint solvers typically solve problems by interleaving search and propagation. Propagation is an iterative procedure which, at each iteration, propagates every constraint in the problem to narrow the domains of its variables. The iteration stops when no constraint changes the domains of its variables. In this case, propagation has reached a common fixpoint for all constraints. This iterative algorithm is guaranteed to compute the fixpoint in polynomial time if propagating each constraint takes polynomial time and the domains of the variables are defined as lists of values. Very often, however, it is inconvenient or infeasible to list all values explicitly: instead the domains are defined by lower and upper bounds. We focus on this representation, and on variables taking integer values. In this setting, computing a fixpoint by the iterative algorithm may require exponential time even if each constraint can be propagated in polynomial time. We show that this exponential behaviour is not simply due to the iterative algorithm being suboptimal; rather it is intrinsic to the\nc©2011 AI Access Foundation.

      "text" : "We illustrate the behaviour of the iterative fixpoint algorithm using a system of two constraints:\nx+ y = 7, x+ 1 ≥ 2y, with initial bounds: x ∈ [0, 5], y ∈ [0, 10]\nA possible trace of the fixpoint computation is the following. The lower bound of y is initially 0 but from the constraint x + y = 7 we deduce that y cannot take values 0 or 1: if it does, then the sum is < 7, even if we fix x to its highest allowed value. Therefore the intervals can be narrowed down to x ∈ [0, 5], y ∈ [2, 10]. Similarly:\nfrom x+ y = 7, we deduce: x ∈ [0, 5], y ∈ [2, 7]; from x+ 1 ≥ 2y, we deduce: x ∈ [3, 5], y ∈ [2, 7]; and: x ∈ [3, 5], y ∈ [2, 3]; back to x+ y = 7, we now deduce: x ∈ [4, 5], y ∈ [2, 3].\nAt this point we have reached a common fixpoint for both constraints, because we cannot deduce that the domains need to be narrowed any further.\nThis algorithm, however, exhibits slow convergence behaviour even in deceivingly simple examples such as:\nx < y, y < x with initial bounds: x ∈ [0, 108], y ∈ [0, 108] (1)\nThe iterative algorithm for fixpoint computation shrinks the bounds by one unit in each iteration, which means that 108 iterations will be required to reach the fixpoint, which in this case is empty. This slow convergence is in fact exponential in the size of the problem representation, as log(108) bits are enough to represent each bound. This behaviour is not limited to artificial examples as the previous one but in fact happens time and again when solving problems with large numerical ranges. This severely limits the application of CP in areas such as software verification or theorem proving where large ranges are needed (e.g., the whole 32-bit integer range).\nDue to the importance of the problem, efforts have been made to alleviate slow convergence, notably Jaffar, Maher, Stuckey, and Yap (1994), Lhomme, Gottlieb, Rueher, and Taillibert (1996), Lebbah and Lhomme (2002), Leconte and Berstel (2006); but all proposed algorithmic improvements prevent slow convergence only in specific cases. Fully addressing the slow convergence problem would require a strongly polynomial algorithm for fixpoint computation. Therefore the question is: does such an algorithm exist, or is bound propagation in fact intractable?"

      "text" : "Standard propagation algorithms are iterative processes that apply ”propagators”, i.e., narrowing functions associated with each constraint, until reaching a fixpoint. Their complexity is therefore determined by two complementary questions:\nQ1: How hard is it to compute each propagator?\nQ2: How hard is it to find a common fixpoint of the propagators?\nThe complexity of constraint propagation has in a sense been extremely well-studied, but all the results we are aware of for bound propagation deal with Question 1 only. Those prior hardness results showed that for some complex constraints we cannot have polynomial-time propagators reaching certain levels of consistency. Two such results are:\n• Given a linear equality it has been observed (Yuanlin & Yap, 2000; Choi, Harvey, Lee, & Stuckey, 2006) that any propagator that reaches arc consistency or bound(Z) consistency1 needs to solve a knapsack problem, which is NP-complete in the weak sense. For this reason propagators for linear constraints used in practice either reach a weaker consistency such as bound(R) consistency, or are restricted to very small domains, as proposed for instance in Trick (2001).\n• Results by Bessière (2006) prove that even bounded-arity (two-variable) constraints can be constructed for which checking bound(Z) consistency is NP-complete.\nQuestion 2 only makes sense, of course, in the common case where the propagators are polynomial-time computable (if they are not, computing their common fixpoint cannot be easy in general). The only known fact in this case is that the standard, iterative propagation algorithms often take an exponential number of steps to reach a fixpoint in practice, as mentioned and illustrated in Section 1.1. This leaves open the question whether better algorithms exist or fixpoint computation is, in fact, intrinsically hard."

      "text" : "In this paper we consider very simple, common propagators and address Question 2. We show that in general even surprisingly simple propagators can lead to a fixpoint computation problem that is NP-hard. This not only explains why all standard, iterative fixpointcomputation algorithms have an exponential worst-case in practice, but also shows it is unlikely that the there exists an algorithm with better worst case. In particular an important class of simple propagators whose fixpoint computation is NP-hard is the bound(R) consistency propagators for linear constraints (Proposition 1). These are ubiquitous constraints, and very weak and widely used propagators for these constraints. Many problems that use numerical computations and large domains tend to include at least linear constraints, therefore there are few cases where slow convergence will be avoidable. We nevertheless identify one such case: if the coefficients of the linear constraints are all unit (1 in absolute value), then bound(R) consistency can be obtained in polynomial time by a non-standard propagation algorithm based on Linear Programming. We also study other types of basic numerical constraints: multiplication and max."

      "text" : "The constraints of the problem are associated with propagators. (In our setting there will be, in general, several propagators per constraint.) We follow the classical presentation of propagators as operators on a lattice, initiated in work by Benhamou (1996) and on which more details can be found in papers by Apt (1999), and Schulte and Carlsson (2006): each propagator is a function that can narrow the domains of (some of) the variables, removing values that cannot appear in any solution. Thus, we talk about the current domain of a variable xi, as the result of it being narrowed by the application of one or more propagators. We denote by x−i the current lower bound of xi and by x + i its current upper bound. x − i and x+i are initially set to the initial bounds li, ui and remain afterwards constrained by li ≤ x − i ≤ x + i ≤ ui. We denote by D the Cartesian product of the intervals [li, ui] for all i ∈ 1..n.\nDefinition 1 (Propagator) A propagator for a constraint k ∈ 1..m is a function f : P(D) → P(D), that is:\n• monotone, i.e., A′ ⊆ A → f(A′) ⊆ f(A);\n• contracting, i.e., f(A) ⊆ A;\n• correct, i.e., no point in A \\ f(A) satisfies the constraint.\nWe restrict ourselves to propagators that are polynomial-time computable. Bound consistency propagators are additionally restricted to elements of P(D) that are representable as Cartesian products of intervals, plus the special value ∅.\nSeveral types of propagators can be used for numerical constraints; these propagators are characterized by the level of consistency they enforce. Since we have restricted our focus to interval domains, we present only bound consistency. The two main variants are bound(Z) and bound(R) consistency:\nDefinition 2 (Bound(Z|R) support) A bound(Z) (bound(R)) support of a constraint k is an assignment τ of integer (real) values to the variables X such that x−i ≤ τ(xi) ≤ x + i for i ∈ 1..n and τ satisfies the constraint k.\nDefinition 3 (Bound(Z|R) consistency) A constraint k is bound(Z) (bound(R)) consistent iff for every variable xi ∈ X, there exists a bound(Z) (bound(R)) support τ\n− with τ−(xi) = x − i and a bound(Z) (bound(R)) support τ + with τ+(xi) = x + i .\nThe difference between the two is easily understood on an example:\nExample 1 Consider the constraint 2x+ 2y + 3z = 4.\n• The intervals x, y, z ∈ [0, 1] are bound(R) consistent since each of the integer bounds has a real-valued support: x = 0 is supported by the tuple (x = 0, y = 1, z = 2/3); z = 1 and y = 0 by the tuple (x = 1/2, y = 0, z = 1); x = 1, y = 1 and z = 0 by the tuple (x = 1, y = 1, z = 0).\n• These intervals are, however, not bound(Z) consistent: the only integer solution is (x = 1, y = 1, z = 0), which means that bound(Z) consistency would reduce the bounds further to x ∈ [1, 1], y ∈ [1, 1], z ∈ [0, 0].\nBound(Z) consistency requires that we check the existence of an integer-valued support, and for some classes of constraints such as linear equalities each propagator would need to solve an NP-complete problem. Since our focus is on the computation of common fixpoint of simple operators, we only consider bound(R) consistency in this paper. As noted previously in the literature (Schulte & Stuckey, 2005), bound(R) consistency it is in fact “the bound consistency implemented for most primitive constraints”, precisely because it is often the only one for which propagators are easy to compute in general for large domains. In the rest of the paper we focus on several of the main basic types of numerical constraints (in particular linear ones), and give further details on the bound(R) consistency propagators obtained for these constraints. In all the cases we consider the propagators are very simple indeed."

(Note that our definition of propagators implies that f(∅) = ∅ for all f ∈ F . Therefore ∅ is always a common fixpoint.) In other words: do the propagators stabilize to non-empty domains?\nAs often in complexity work we mostly focus on the Decision problem in this paper. The reason is that the basic complexity classes (NP in particular) are defined for decision problems, and that hardness results on the decision problem also imply that the function problem is hard. The only place where we refer to the function problem is this section, where we describe the basic greatest fixpoint computation algorithm.\nAn algorithm for computing gfp(F ) is specified in Fig. 1. It is presented in its simplest form, which excludes several possible optimizations related, in particular, to the fact that not all constraints necessarily deal with all variables. (These optimizations are well-known and orthogonal to our discussion in this paper.) In this algorithm we initialize the Cartesian product of domains to D, in other words we initially have x−i = li and x + i = ui, for all i ∈ 1..n; and we simply apply all propagators until a stable state is reached, i.e., no propagator shrinks any domain further.

(Note that we have in general one or more propagators per constraint, i.e., p ≥ m.) We enter the while loop at most nd times since at every new iteration we must reduce at least one bound by one unit, and each time the foreach loop is entered at most p times. Overall the algorithm therefore terminates after a number of propagator applications of:\nO(npd).\nIn other words, it is in fact exponential in the number of bits of the encoding: this complexity can be written O(np·2b), where b is the number of bits of the bound encoding. This is despite the fact that each propagator is polynomial in the size of the encoding. Such algorithms are called pseudo-polynomial. In contrast algorithms that are truly polynomial in the number of bits of the encoding, i.e., whose worst-case time complexity is O(π(n,m, log d)), for some polynomial π, are called strongly polynomial (Papadimitiou, 1994). The problem of a pseudo-polynomial algorithm for this problem is that it scales linearly with the size of the domains, which may themselves be exponentially large. Since the propagators we consider take strongly polynomial time, the analyis of the upper bound is summarized as follows:\nObservation 1 The naive fixpoint computation algorithm (Fig. 1) always terminates in pseudo-polynomial-time.\nThe question is whether strongly polynomial algorithms exist.

An early pseudo-polynomial time algorithm can be found in work by Aspvall and Shiloach (1980); this algorithm essentially reduces the problem to a 2-SAT instance of size m · d, which is solvable in linear time (the overall algorithm therefore runs in pseudo-polynomial time, but also with a pseudo-polynomial space requirement). A particularly relevant algorithm for TVPI constraints is proposed in the work of BarYehuda and Rawitz (2001). This algorithm has pseudo-polynomial time complexity with low, strongly polynomial space requirements. Interestingly, this algorithm essentially uses bound propagation (in fact, precisely bound(R) consistency), and embeds it in what amounts to a backtrack-free search with a “parallel” improvement that allows to amortize its overall runtime.\nThis seems to suggest a strong relation between propagation and TVPI constraints; in particular one could easily be mistaken to believe that propagation is a decision procedure for systems of TVPI constraints. We say that propagation provides a decision procedure for a class of constraints if propagation fails exactly when the constraints are unsatisfiable (in\n3. Here we focus on feasibility only. The optimization problem, i.e., optimizing a linear function under TVPI constraints, is strongly NP-hard, i.e., NP-hard even for bounded domain sizes (in fact domains {0, 1} are enough), because it trivially encodes Max-2SAT (Bar-Yehuda & Rawitz, 2001).\nother words: the existence of a bound consistent state suffices to guarantee the existence of a solution).

Note that such propagators can effectively be used to deal with variables with a real-valued domain, indeed they are used both in the Constraint Programming community (Behamou & Granvilliers, 2006) and in the Operations Research community, where a different terminology is used (Feasibility-Based Bounds Tightening, see e.g. Belotti, Cafieri, Lee & Liberti, 2010).\nThe decision problem we focus on is now whether there exist real-valued bounds that are a fixpoint. We note that this problem is tractable; a similar result has been reported independently in the work of Belotti, Cafieri, Lee, and Liberti (2010).\nDecision Problem 2 (Fixpoint of Continuous Linear Propagators) INPUT: a CSP whose set of constraints C are linear inequalities. QUESTION: Does the set of real-valued propagators F = {Si,k : i ∈ 1..n, k ∈ 1..m} associated to C have a common fixpoint?\nObservation 2 Decision problem 2 can be decided by Linear Programming.\nIt is easy to see that the fixpoints of operators Si,k are exactly the real-valued solutions to the system of linear constraints of Eq. 6. Note that we have been careful in the statement of Observation 2: whether Linear Programming is strongly polynomial is in fact a longstanding open question (Smale, 1998). The best “polynomial-time” LP algorithms are, encouragingly, of time complexity O(π(n,m, b)) for some polynomial π, where b is the number of bits of the number encoding—this looks strongly polynomial (Khachian, 1979). But there is a catch: the complexity is counted in number of operations, and operations on the rationals can in principle expand the size of the numbers (repeated multiplications can blow-up the representation exponentially). However, for practical purposes, typical LP implementations prevent the blow-up of number representation by limiting the precision to b bits throughout the execution; solvability by Linear Programming is widely regarded as synonymous to strong tractability, and provably sub-exponential LP algorithms exist (Matousek, Sharir, & Welzl, 1996). In other words, Observation 2 should really be read as a carefully phrased way to say that Problem 2 is efficiently solvable in practice."

      "text" : "A unit linear constraint is of the usual form ∑\ni∈1...n ai,kxi ≥ ck but with the additional restriction that each coefficient ai,k is chosen in {−1, 0,+1}. Our introductory example of slow convergence (Eq. 1) was a (particularly simple) example of unit linear constraints, and the slow convergence could in this particular case be avoided. Note that we are considering linear unit constraints of any number of variables. A special case of unit constraints that have been widely studied is the class of unit-TVPI constraints (i.e., both unit and TVPI). This is perhaps the most important class of linear constraints whose integer feasibility can be solved in strongly polynomial time, see for instance work by Jaffar et al. (1994).\nProposition 2 When all constraints have unit coefficients, Decision Problem 1 can be decided by Linear Programming.\nProof. The LP is, of course, of the form given in Eq. 6. The observation is, in short, that no rounding is needed when the coefficients are unit.\nMore precisely, for any Cartesian product of intervals A, let L(A) = ⋂\ni,k Li,k(A) and S(A) = ⋂\ni,k Si,k(A). We show that when all coefficients are unit and when (as defined) the bounds of the initial Cartesian product D are integral, then we have Lt(D) = St(D), for all t ≥ 0. We first note that the bounds of Lt(D) are integral for all t since the original state D has integral bounds and that each operator in L applies rounding. The equality Lt(D) = St(D) is now proved by induction on t. For t = 0, Lt(D) = St(D) = D. If the induction hypothesis holds at step t, then St+1(D) = S(St(D)) = S(Lt(D)). Now St+1(D) = L(Lt(D)) = Lt+1(D) because Lt(D) has integral bounds, hence applying S or L on this Cartesian product gives the same result. (In Eq. 5 all qi,ks are integral in this case and all ai,ks are unit therefore the division qi,k/ai,k gives an integer, which means that the propagators Li,k with rounding return the same result as the non-rounded propagators Si,k of Eq. 9.)\nNow having Lt(D) = St(D), for all t ≥ 0 it is easy to see that gfp{Li,k} = gfp{Si,k}. Because the domains are finite Lt(D) stabilizes for a finite t. For this particular t, Lt(D) is the greatest fixpoint of L and the same greatest Cartesian product St(D) is also the greatest fixpoint of S. 2\nNote that in general Linear Programming does not necessarily find integer solutions to the system of Eq. 6; what the result shows is that LP will find a solution iff an integer one exists. If we want to actually compute the largest consistent bounds x−i and x + i of a certain variable xi, we can simply minimize x − i or maximize x + i under the constraints of Eq. 6. The previous proof shows that these extremal values are integral."

With respect to restrictions on the constraint graph, there are nevertheless reasons to be pessimistic: we note that the feasibility of monotone TVPI Integer Programming remains NP-complete under strict restrictions on the constraint graph, as shown in the work of Hochbaum and Naor (1994). This suggests that such restrictions are unlikely to lead to interesting tractable classes of fixpoint computation.\nRegarding the restrictions on coefficients, we note that in general the NP-completeness of (monotone) TVPI constraints assumes that the coefficients ak, bk, ck are arbitrary. The Unit restriction imposes, on the contrary, the strongest restriction on coefficients: that their absolute value be ≤ 1. If we impose a more general bound β on these absolute values then one may wonder whether the problem exhibits some form of fixed-parameter tractability. We leave this question open for future work."

First, we show that if the simplest possible type of polynomials (a single squaring operation) is added to linear constraints, then our general hardness result can be strengthened. Second, it is interesting to note that if we enrich unit linear constraints with simple min or max constraints, then fixpoint computation is equivalent to a puzzling open problem discussed recently in the theorem-proving literature.

In this setting the bound(R) consistency propagators are defined by the following instructions:\nx−i := max(x − i ,\n(\nx−j )2 ) x+i := min(x + i , ( x+j )2 )\nx−j := max(x − j ,\n⌈\n√\nx−i\n⌉\n) x+j := min(x + j ,\n⌊\n√\nx+i\n⌋\n)\nIn other words the fixpoints are integer solutions to the following bound consistency inequalities:\nx−i ≥ ( x−j )2 ; x+i ≤ ( x+j )2 ; x−j ≥\n√\nx−i ; x + j ≤\n√\nx+i (10)\nWhen these simple quadratic constraints are added to the language of linear constraints, our NP-completeness result can be strengthened: the problem is NP-complete even when considering a bounded(!) number of variables and constraints; in fact one TVPI constraint and one squaring constraint. This is due to the fact that fixpoint computation converges to a state that encodes a complex number-theoretic problem.\nProposition 3 Given a CSP with 3 variables and 2 constraints a1x1 + a2x2 = c, x1 = x 2 3, determining whether their associated bound(R) consistency propagators have a fixpoint is NP-complete.\nProof. Membership in NP is straightforward. We show the hardness result for the special case where ai ≥ 0, i ∈ {1, 2, 3} and focus, as said, on positive intervals. We first note that the bound consistency inequalities of (Eq. 10) for the squaring constraint x1 = x 2 3 are satisfied iff x−1 = (x − 3 ) 2 and x+1 = (x + 3 )\n2 since we focus on integer bounds. (This property of the squaring propagator is noticed in a slightly different form in Schulte & Stuckey, 2005). From a propagation viewpoint the equality a1x1 + a2x2 = c is seen as two inequalities a1x1 + a2x2 ≥ c and −a1x1 − a2x2 ≥ c whose bound consistent inequalities (Eq. 4) are effectively satisfied iff a1x − 1 + a2x + 2 = c and a1x + 1 + a2x − 2 = c.\nWe rely on a theorem (Manders & Adleman, 1978) which shows that deciding whether an equation of the form a1x 2 3 + a2x2 = c has integer solutions, where a1, a2 and c are non-negative integers, is NP-complete. We reduce this problem to the existence of bound consistent bounds for the conjunction a1x1+ a2x2 = c, x1 = x 2 3 with initial bounds l1 = l2 = l3 = 0 and u1 = u2 = u3 = c. We just need to show that fixpoint computation is complete for this system—a bound consistent state is found iff the original equation has a solution:\n• If the original equation has a solution, i.e., a pair of non-negative integer values 〈v2, v3〉 satisfying a1v 2 3 + a2v2 = c, then we define x − 1 = x + 1 = v 2 3, x − 2 = x + 2 = v2, and\nx−3 = x + 3 = v3. These bounds are such that 0 ≤ x − i ≤ x + i ≤ c and satisfy the bound consistency conditions of Eq. 10 and Eq. 4.\n• If the conjunction has a bound consistent state, i.e., bounds x−i , x + i such that Eq. 10\nand Eq. 4 are satisfied, then the solution v defined by v2 = x + 2 and v3 = x − 3 satisfies the original equation a1v 2 3 + a2v2 = c.\n2"

In other words the fixpoints are characterized by the following inequalities:\nx+h ≤ max(x + i , x + j ) x + i ≤ x + h x + j ≤ x + h x − h ≥ x − i x − h ≥ x − j\nThe fixpoint computation of max constraints mixed with unit linear constraints is interesting because its complexity is an open problem. Note that there is no rounding or use of\ncoefficients in the definition of the bound consistency inequalities, therefore the complexity arising from rounding in all our NP-complete variants of propagation does not arise here. The open problem we connect to is called Max-Atom in the work of Bezem, Nieuwenhuis, and Rodŕıguez-Carbonell (2008); see this reference for prior problems of interest that are shown equivalent to Max-Atom. A max-atom constraint is of the form: max(xi, xj)+c ≥ xh. The work reported by Bezem et al. (2008) shows a number of results on the feasibility of conjunctions of max-atom constraints: (1) There is no significant complexity difference between integer and real feasibility; (2) The problem can be decided in pseudo-polynomial time using what amounts to a fixpoint computation algorithm; (3) The problem has short proofs of unsatisfiability and is therefore in NP∩coNP; which means that it is of a very different nature from our other NP-complete variants. In fact, a recent result (Atserias & Maneva, 2010) shows that the complexity of Max-Atom is equivalent to well-known open problems called mean-payoff games, which have in turn connections to some important open questions in model-checking: parity games, a class of games reducible to mean-payoff games, are equivalent to the model-checking problem of µ-calculus (Emerson, Jutla, & Sistla, 1993; Jurdzinski, 1998).\nHere we draw a simple connection that follows from the observation that the bound consistency inequalities for the upper bounds include the constraint x+h ≤ max(x + i , x + j ) which encode max-atom constraints almost directly.\nProposition 4 Bound(R) consistency for a combination of unit linear and max constraints can be solved in polynomial time only if Max-Atom can be also be solved in polynomial time.\nProof. To reduce a Max-Atom instance with variables xi, i ∈ 1 . . . n and m constraints to a fixpoint computation problem we simply introduce one fresh variable yk, for each k ∈ 1 . . . m. Let the kth constraint be of the form max(xik , xjk)+ ck ≥ xhk , it rewrites to the conjunction max(xik , xjk) = yk, yk + ck ≥ xhk . The lower bounds of all variables are fixed to 0 and the upper bounds need only be set to ∑\nk∈1...m ck by the small model property (Lemma 2) of the paper by Bezem et al. (2008). The bound consistency equations for the upper bounds directly encode the problem. 2"

      "text" : "We last note a connection between our results and the class of max-closed constraints introduced by Jeavons and Cooper (1995) (more on this in, e.g., Petke & Jeavons, 2009). A constraint R(x1, . . . , xn) is max-closed if whenever we have two solutions 〈v1 . . . vn〉 and 〈w1 . . . wn〉, their maximum defined as 〈max(v1, w1), . . . ,max(vn, wn)〉 is also a solution. Results by Jeavons and Cooper (1995) show that max-closed constraints are tractable: if a system of constraints is max-closed, then its feasibility can be determined in polynomial time. However note that this result essentially assumes an explicit (or table) representation of the constraint, i.e., it is assumed that each constraint is defined by explicitly listing the tuples that are solutions to it. In contrast some important types of constraints such as the numerical constraints considered in this paper are implicitly defined : we do not know the list of solutions to R(x1, . . . , xn) but can only verify efficiently whether a particular tuple is accepted by the constraint.\nImplicitly-defined max-closed constraints played an important role in this paper: both the monotone TVPI constraints, considered in Section 3.2 and the Max-atom constraints considered in Section 4.2, are max-closed, as shown respectively by Hochbaum and Naor (1994), and Bezem et al. (2008). In sharp contrast to the case of explicitly-defined constraints, the resolution of implicitly-defined max-closed constraints is therefore only pseudopolynomial and it is in fact intractable, as shown by the special case of monotone TVPI constraints:\nObservation 3 The feasibility of ”implicitly-defined” max-closed constraints is NP-complete.\nAs shown in Section 3.2 with the particular example of monotone TVPI constraints, even the fixpoint computation of implicitly defined max-closed constraints is, in fact, NPcomplete in general."

      "text" : "Reasoning about intervals was introduced in the AI literature by the works of Cleary (1987), and Davis (1987)5. A substantial body of AI work has ensued (see, e.g. Hyvönen, 1992); bound computation is now used by most finite-domain CP solvers (Schulte & Carlsson, 2006).\nIn this paper we have theoretically investigated the complexity of computing the common fixpoint of a set of bound consistency propagators. We have shown that even when the propagators are themselves very simple, the fixpoint computation used in these algorithms can be complex, it is indeed NP-complete even for a very restricted constraint class – linear monotone inequalities with two variables per inequality. We also considered some special classes of constraints, like quadratic constraints and max constraints. Finally, we identified a class of constraints, namely, linear inequalities with unit coefficients, that allows a tractable fixpoint computation algorithm.\nBound propagation is a successful and widely used technique in Constraint Programing. There is a large literature on propagating single constraints (Van Hoeve & Katriel, 2006; Bessière, 2006; Rossi, van Beek, & Walsh, 2006) and it is perhaps a surprise that no prior study exists on the complexity of the fixpoint computation. The NP-completeness of fixpoint computation for simple types of constraints is a fundamental and somewhat surprising result, and one that sheds light on slow convergence phenomena.\nThis result also “puts bound propagation on the map” of AI computational problems: together with knapsack constraints and some forms of learning in neural nets (Schaeffer & Yannakakis, 1991), it is one of the few important AI problems we are aware of that have a pseudo-polynomial complexity and yet are intractable."

It is typically embedded within a search procedure (”branch and prune”) and used at every node of the search tree to narrow down the search space, so it is critical that it be fast. The procedure invokes constraint propagators until a common fixpoint is reached, but the known algorithms for this have a pseudo-polynomial worst-case time complexity: they are fast indeed when the variables have a small numerical range, but they have the well-known problem of being prohibitively slow when these ranges are large. An important question is therefore whether stronglypolynomial algorithms exist that compute the common bound consistent fixpoint of a set of constraints. This paper answers this question. In particular we show that this fixpoint computation is in fact NP-complete, even when restricted to binary linear constraints.",
