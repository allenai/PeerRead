      "text" : "Neural machine translation (NMT) systems are sensitive to the data they are trained on. The available parallel corpora come from various genres and have different stylistic variations and semantic ambiguities. While such data is often beneficial for a general purpose machine translation system, a problem arises when building systems for specific domains such as lectures (Cettolo et al., 2014), patents (Fujii et al., 2010) or medical text\n(Bojar et al., 2014), where either the in-domain bilingual text does not exist or is available in small quantities.\nDomain adaptation aims to preserve the identity of the in-domain data while exploiting the out-ofdomain data in favor of the in-domain and avoiding possible drift towards out-of-domain jargon and style. The most commonly used approach to train a domain-specific neural MT system is to fine-tune an existing model (trained on generic data) with the new domain (Luong and Manning, 2015; Freitag and Al-Onaizan, 2016; Servan et al., 2016; Chu et al., 2017) or to add domain-aware tags in building a concatenated system (Kobus et al., 2016).\nIn this paper we explore NMT in a multidomain scenario. Considering a small in-domain corpus and a number of out-of-domain corpora, we target questions like:\n• What are different ways to combine multiple domains during a training process?\n• What is the best strategy to build an optimal in-domain system?\n• Which training strategy results in a robust system?\n• Which strategy should be used to build a decent in-domain system given limited time?\nTo answer these, we try the following approaches: i) data concatenation: train a system by concatenating all the available in-domain and out-ofdomain data; ii) model stacking: build NMT in an online fashion starting from the most distant domain, fine-tune on the closer domain and finish by fine-tuning the model on the in-domain data; iii) data selection: select a certain percentage of the available out-of-domain corpora that is most\nar X\niv :1\n70 8.\n08 71\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n9 A\nug 2\n01 7\nclosest to the in-domain data and use it for training the system; iv) multi-model ensemble: separately train models for each available domain and combine them during decoding using balanced or weighted averaging. We experiment with ArabicEnglish and German-English language pairs. Our results demonstrate the following findings:\n• A concatenated system fine-tuned on the indomain data achieves the most optimal indomain system.\n• Model stacking works best when starting from the furthest domain, fine-tuning on closer domains and then finally fine-tuning on the in-domain data.\n• A concatenated system on all available data results in the most robust system.\n• Data selection gives a decent trade-off between translation quality and training time.\n• Weighted ensemble is helpful when several individual models have been already trained and there is no time for retraining/fine-tuning.\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the adaptation approaches explored in this work. We present experimental design in Section 3. Section 4 summarizes the results and Section 5 concludes."

      "heading" : "2.2 Fine Tuning and Model Stacking",
      "text" : "Neural machine translation follows an online training strategy. It sees only a small portion of the data in every training step and estimates the value of network parameters based on that portion. Previous work has exploited this strategy in the context of domain adaptation. Luong and Manning (2015) trained an initial model on an out-ofdomain data and later extended the training on indomain data. In this way the final model parameters are tuned towards the in-domain data. The approach is referred as fine-tuning later on.\nSince in this work we deal with several domains, we propose a stacking method that uses multi-level fine-tuning to train a system. Figure 1 (second row) shows the complete procedure: first, the model is trained on the out-of-domain data Do1 for N epochs; training is resumed from N + 1-th epoch to the M -th epoch but using the next available out-of-domain data Do2 ; repeat the process till all of the available out-of-domain corpora have been used; in the last step, resume training on the in-domain data Di for a few epochs. The resulting model has seen all of the available data as in the case of the data concatenation approach. However, here the system learns from the data domain by domain. We call this technique model stacking.\nThe model stacking and fine-tuning approaches have the advantage of seeing the in-domain data in the end of training, thus making the system parameters more optimized for the in-domain data. They also provide flexibility in extending an existing model to any new domain without having to retrain the complete system again on the available corpora."
    }, {
      "heading" : "2.3 Data Selection",
      "text" : "Building a model, whether concatenated or stacked, on all the available data is computationally expensive. An alternative approach is data selection, where we select a part of the out-ofdomain data which is close to the in-domain data for training. The intuition here is two fold: i) the out-of-domain data is huge and takes a lot of time to train on, and ii) not all parts of the outof-domain data are beneficial for the in-domain data. Training only on a selected part of the out-ofdomain data reduces the training time significantly while at the same time creating a model closer to the in-domain.\nIn this work, we use the modified Moore-Lewis (Axelrod et al., 2011) for data selection. It trains in- and out-of-domain n-gram models and then ranks sequences in the out-of-domain data based on cross-entropy difference. The out-of-domain sentences below a certain threshold are selected for training. Since we are dealing with several out-of-domain corpora, we apply data selection separately on each of them and build a concatenated system using in-domain plus selected outof-domain data as shown in Figure 1. Data selection significantly reduces data size thus improving training time for NMT. However, finding the optimal threshold to filter data is a cumbersome process. We explore data selection as an alternative to the above mentioned techniques."

      "heading" : "2.4 Multi-domain Ensemble",
      "text" : "Out-of-domain data is generally available in larger quantity. Training a concatenated system whenever a new in-domain becomes available is expensive in terms of both time and computation. An alternative to fine-tuning the system with new indomain is to do ensemble of the new model with the existing model. The ensemble approach brings the flexibility to use them during decoding without a need of retraining and fine-tuning.\nConsider N models that we would like to use to generate translations. For each decoding step, we\nuse the scores over the vocabulary from each of these N models and combine them by averaging. We then use these averaged scores to choose the output word(s) for each hypothesis in our beam. The intuition is to combine the knowledge of the N models to generate a translation. We refer to this approach as balanced ensemble later on. Since here we deal with several different domains, averaging scores of all the models equally may not result in optimum performance. We explore a variation of balanced ensemble called weighted ensemble that performs a weighted average of these scores, where the weights can be pre-defined or learned on a development set.\nBalanced ensemble using several models of a single training run saved at different iterations has shown to improve performance by 1-2 BLEU points (Sennrich et al., 2016a). Here our goal is not to improve the best available system but to benefit from individual models built using several domains during a single decoding process. We experiment with both balanced ensemble and weighted ensemble under the multi-domain condition only."

The reason is\n4For German-English, we ran the models until they converged because the training data is much smaller compared to Arabic-English direction\nthe difference in genre of UN from the TED corpus where the former consists of United Nations proceedings and the latter is based on talks.\nFor German-English, the systems built using out-of-domain corpora performed better than the in-domain corpus.

We mainly tried two variations: i) concatenating all the available data (ALL) ii) combine only the available outof-domain data (OD) and later fine-tune the model on the in-domain data. Table 3 shows the results. The fine-tuned system outperformed a full concatenated system by 1.8 and 2.1 average BLEU points in Arabic-English and German-English systems respectively.\nLooking at the development life line of these systems (Figures 2, 3), since ALL has seen all of the data, it is better than OD till the point OD is fine-tuned on the in-domain corpus. Interestingly, at that point ALL and OD→TED have seen the same amount of data but the parameters of the latter model are fine-tuned towards the in-domain data. This gives it average improvements of up to 2 BLEU points over ALL.\nThe ALL system does not give any explicit weight to any domain 5 during training. In order to revive the in-domain data, we fine-tuned it on the in-domain data. We achieved comparable results to that of the OD→TED model which means that one can adapt an already trained model on all the available data to a specific domain by fine tuning\n5other than the data size itself\nit on the domain of interest. This can be helpful in cases where in-domain data is not known beforehand."

      "heading" : "4.3 Model Stacking",
      "text" : "Previously we concatenated all out-of-domain data and fine-tuned it with the in-domain TED corpus. In this approach, we picked one out-ofdomain corpus at a time, trained a model and finetuned it with the other available domain. We repeated this process till all out-of-domain data had been used. In the last step, we fine-tuned the model on the in-domain data. Since we have a number of out-of-domain corpora available, we experimented with using them in different permutations for training and analyzed their effect on the\ndevelopment sets. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the results. It is interesting to see that the order of stacking has a significant effect on achieving a high quality system. The best combination for the Arabic-English language pair started with the UN data, fine-tuned on OPUS and then fine-tuned on TED. When we started with OPUS and finetuned the model on UN, the results dropped drastically as shown in Figure 2 (see OPUS→UN). The model started forgetting the previously used data and focused on the newly provided data which is very distant from the in-domain data. We saw similar trends in the case of German-English language pair where CC→EP dropped the performance drastically. We did not fine-tune CC→EP and OPUS→UN on TED since there was no better model to fine-tune than to completely ignore the second corpus i.e. UN and EP for Arabic and German respectively and fine-tune OPUS and CC on TED. The results of OPUS→TED and CC→TED are shown in Figures.\nComparing the OPUS→TED system with the UN→OPUS→TED system, the result of OPUS→TED are lowered by 0.62 BLEU points from the UN→OPUS→TED system. Similarly, we saw a drop of 0.4 BLEU points for GermanEnglish language pair when we did not use EP and directly fine-tuned CC on TED. There are two ways to look at these results, considering quality vs. time: i) by using UN and EP in model stacking, the model learned to remember only those parts of the data that are beneficial for achieving\nbetter translation quality on the in-domain development sets. Thus using them as part of the training pipeline is helpful for building a better system. ii) training on UN and EP is expensive. Dropping them from the pipeline significantly reduced the training time and resulted in a loss of 0.62 and 0.4 BLEU points only.\nTo summarize, model stacking performs best when it starts from the domain furthest from the in-domain data. In the following, we compare it with the data concatenation approach."

      "heading" : "4.4 Stacking versus Concatenation",
      "text" : "We compared model stacking with different forms of concatenation. In terms of data usage, all models are exposed to identical data. Table 4 shows the results. The best systems are achieved using a concatenation of all of the out-of-domain data for initial model training and then fine-tuning the trained model on the in-domain data. The concatenated system ALL performed the lowest among all.\nALL learned a generic model from all the available data without giving explicit weight to any particular domain whereas model stacking resulted in a specialized system for the in-domain data. In order to confirm the generalization ability of ALL vs. model stacking, we tested them on a new domain, News. ALL performed 4 BLEU points better than model stacking in translating the news NIST MT04 testset. This concludes that a concatenation system is not an optimum solution for one particular domain but is robust enough to perform well in new testing conditions."

      "heading" : "4.5 Data Selection",
      "text" : "Since training on large out-of-domain data is time inefficient, we selected a small portion of out-ofdomain data that is closer to the in-domain data. For Arabic-English, we selected 3% and 5% from the UN and OPUS data respectively which constitutes roughly 2M sentences. For German-English, we selected 20% from a concatenation of EP and CC, which roughly constitutes 1M training sentences.6\nWe concatenated the selected data and the indomain data to train an NMT system. Table 5 presents the results. The selected system is worse than the ALL system. This is in contrary to the results mentioned in the literature on phrase-based machine translation where data selection on UN improves translation quality (Sajjad et al., 2013).\n6These data-selection percentages have been previously found to be optimal when training phrase-based systems using the same data. For example see (Sajjad et al., 2013).\nThis shows that NMT is not as sensitive as phrasebased to the presence of the out-of-domain data.\nData selection comes with a cost of reduced translation quality. However, the selected system is better than all individual systems shown in Table 2. Each of these out-of-domain systems take more time to train than a selected system. For example, compared to individual UN system, the selected system took approximately 1/10th of the time to train. One can look at data selected system as a decent trade-off between training time and translation quality."

For weighted ensemble, we did a grid search and selected the weights using the development set. Table 6 presents the results of an ensemble on the Arabic-English language pair and compares them with the individual best model, OPUS, and a model built on ALL. As expected, balanced ensemble (ENSb) dropped results compared to the best individual model. Since the domains are very distant, giving equal weights to them hurts the overall performance. The weighted ensemble (ENSw) improved from the best individual model by 1.8 BLEU points but is still lower than the concatenated system by 1.7 BLEU points. The weighted ensemble approach is beneficial when individual domain specific models are already available for testing. Decoding with multiple models is more efficient compared to training a system from scratch on a concatenation of the entire data."

The domain aware system performed slightly better than the concatenated system (up to 0.3 BLEU points) when tested on the in-domain TED development sets. However, domain tags bring a limitation to the model since it can only be tested on the domains it is trained on. Testing on an unknown domain would first require to find its closest domain from the set of domains the model is trained on. The system can then use that tag to translate unknown domain sentences."

Our results showed that an optimum indomain system can be built using a concatenation of the out-of-domain data and then fine-tuning it on the in-domain data. A system built on the concatenated data resulted in a generic system that is robust to new domains. Model stacking is sensitive to the order of domains it is trained on. Data selection and weighted ensemble resulted in a less optimal solution. The former is efficient to train in a short time and the latter is useful when different individual models are available for testing. It provides a mix of all domains without retraining or fine-tuning the system."

We investigate data concatenation (with fine tuning), model stacking (multi-level fine tuning), data selection and weighted ensemble. We evaluate these methods based on three criteria: i) translation quality, ii) training time, and iii) robustness towards out-of-domain tests. Our findings on Arabic-English and German-English language pairs show that the best translation quality can be achieved by building an initial system on a concatenation of available out-of-domain data and then fine-tuning it on in-domain data. Model stacking works best when training begins with the furthest out-of-domain data and the model is incrementally fine-tuned with the next furthest domain and so on. Data selection did not give the best results, but can be considered as a decent compromise between training time and translation quality. A weighted ensemble of different individual models performed better than data selection. It is beneficial in a scenario when there is no time for fine-tuning.",
