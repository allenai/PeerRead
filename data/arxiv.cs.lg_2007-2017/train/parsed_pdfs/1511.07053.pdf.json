      "text" : "In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNN, Fukushima, 1980; LeCun et al., 1989) have become the de facto standard in many computer vision tasks. Object classification from an image is almost always done with very deep convolutional neural networks (see, e.g., Lin et al., 2014; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015; Szegedy et al., 2014) by directly training them in a supervised manner. Furthermore, the convolutional neural networks have been found to extract good, generic image representations, when they were trained on a large set of images (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015; Szegedy et al., 2014). These representations from the convolutional neural network have been used in a wide variety of computer vision tasks, ranging from image caption generation (see, e.g., Vinyals et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2015), video description generation (see, e.g., Yao et al., 2015), object localization/detection (see, e.g., Sermanet et al., 2014) to object segmentation (Chen et al., 2015).\nOn the other hand, recurrent neural networks (RNN) have become the method of choice for modeling sequential data, especially in the field of natural language processing. RNNs have become one of the most widely used methods for natural language tasks such as language modeling (see, e.g., Mikolov, 2012), and machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). Also, they have been widely employed by speech communities (see, e.g., Chorowski et al., 2014; Graves & Jaitly, 2014) as well. More recently, recurrent neural networks have begun to be employed in a few computation vision tasks (see, e.g., Visin et al., 2015; Kalchbrenner et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2015; Graves & Schmidhuber, 2009).\n?

Graph based methods (see, e.g., Shi & Malik, 2000; Felzenszwalb & Huttenlocher, 2004; Boykov & Funka-Lea, 2006) that represent the pixels of the image as nodes of the graph, greedy approaches (such as, e.g., Besag, 1986; Cai et al., 2007) and continuation methods (such as, e.g., Blake & Zisserman, 1987; Geman & Geman, 1984) are usually more popular. Recently however a few approaches in this direction have been explored (see, e.g., Graves & Schmidhuber, 2009; Visin et al., 2015; Kalchbrenner et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2015).\nThe architecture proposed in Visin et al. (2015) is related and inspired by this earlier work, but relies on multiple uni-dimensional RNNs coupled in a novel way to address the problem of Object Classification. In the proposed model, the image is first swept by two horizontal RNNs in both directions (left to right and right to left) and then their concatenated hidden state is swept by a second couple of RNNs vertically (top to bottom and bottom to top). The output activation of the ReNet layer is the concatenation of the hidden states of these last two RNNs, which encodes the local features of the image in each position with respect to the whole input image. Finally, a number of fully connected layers and a softmax layer are exploited to predict the class of the object in the image.\nA similar approach to offline Arabic handwriting recognition was previously shown in Graves & Schmidhuber (2009), but was built on the more complex multi-dimensional RNN. One important consequence of the adoption of the usual sequence ones in Visin et al. (2015) is that the number of RNNs at each layer scales linearly with respect to the number of dimensions d of the input image (2d). A multidimensional RNN, on the other hand, requires an exponential number of RNNs at each layer (2d). Furthermore, the proposed variant is more easily parallelizable, as each RNN is dependent only along a horizontal or vertical sequence of patches. This architectural distinction results in our model being much more amenable to distributed computing than that of Graves & Schmidhuber (2009). Kalchbrenner et al. (2015) has further extended many of the concepts from the multidimensional RNN paper of Graves & Schmidhuber (2009), and bears some similarity to the ReNet approach. Grid LSTM inherently uses three dimensional blocks, and modulates information passed over depth, while ReNet simply stacks hidden layers and requires less recurrent passes over the data. The authors of Kalchbrenner et al. (2015) show promising results over a number of tasks, including MNIST recognition, but do not have results for image segmentation or larger image datasets as of this writing.\nIn this work we extend the results of Visin et al. (2015) modifying and extending the ReNet model to the more ambitious task of object segmentation. We test the performances of the model in the object segmentation domain on one of the historically most used datasets in this field, the Weizmann Horse dataset (Borenstein, 2004), the Oxford Flowers 17 dataset (Nilsback & Zisserman, 2006) and the more recent Fashionista dataset (Yamaguchi, 2012).\nOur experiments show that the proposed adaptation of the ReSeg for pixel-level object segmentation can challenge the state of the art. The proposed architecture can be easily merged with that proposed in Visin et al. (2015) into a joint network to perform both object classification and object segmentation at the same time, sharing most of the computation. This could be interesting in application domains where object classification and segmentation have to be performed simultaneously, such as, autonomous driving and object retrieval."

      "text" : "We take as an input an image (or the feature map of the previous layer) X of elements {xi,j,c} ∈ Rw×h×c, where w, h and c are respectively the width, height and number of channels (or features). We then sweep over each of its columns Xi,• a first time with two RNNs, fFV and f B V , that move\ntop-down and bottom-up respectively. Note that the processing of each column is independent and can be done in parallel.\nAt every time step each RNN reads the next non-overlapping patch pi,j ∈ Rwp×hp×c and, based on its previous hidden state, emits a projection vi,j and updates its hidden state zi,j :\nvFi,j = f F V(z F i,j−1, pi,j), for j = 1, · · · , J (1)\nvRi,j = f B V (z R i,j+1, pi,j), for j = J, · · · , 1 (2)\nWe stress that the choice to read non-overlapping patches is a modeling choice and not a limitation of the architecture.\nOnce the first two vertical RNNs have processed the whole inputX , we concatenate their projections vFi,j and v R i,j to obtain a composite feature map V = {vi,j}j=1,...,Ji=1,...,I . Note that, with d the number of recurrent units of each RNN, every element vi,j ∈ R2d can be seen as the activation of a feature detector at the location (i, j) with respect to all the patches in the i-th column of the original input. We denote what we described so far as the first ReSeg sublayer.\nAfter obtaining the concatenated feature map V , we sweep over each of its rows with a pair of new RNNs, fFH and f B H . With a similar but specular procedure as the one described before, we proceed\nreading one element vi,j at each step, to obtain a concatenated feature map H = {hi,j}, once again with hi,j ∈ R2d. Each element hi,j of this second ReSeg sublayer represents the features of one of the input image patches pi,j with contextual information from the whole image.\nThese two sublayers together form what we call a ReSeg layer. It is trivial to note that it is possible to concatenate many ReSeg layers one after the other and train it with any optimization algorithm that performs gradient descent, as the composite model is a smooth, continuous function.\nNote also that fF* and f F * represent a generic Recurrent Neural Network that can be implemented as a vanilla tanh RNN layer, as a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) layer (Cho et al., 2014) or as a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layer (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997)."

The previous work on ReNet has shown that the ReNet model can perform well with little concern for the specific recurrent unit used, but for this particular set of experiments we have chosen to use the GRU unit.\nThe hidden state of the GRU at time t is computed by\nht = (1− ut) ht−1 + ut h̃t, where\nh̃t = tanh (Wxt + U(rt ht−1) + b)\nand [ut; rt] = σ (Wgxt + Ught−1 + bg) .\nFor an in-depth comparison of the similarities and trade-offs between GRU and LSTM, there are several resources including (Chung et al., 2015)."

To have a wider context over the hidden state of the RNN it is possible to interpose a same convolution before the linear fully-connected upsampling layer so that the upsampling layer performs a transformation hi:i+cw,j:j+ch → ok:k+uw,l:l+uh where cw and ch are the width and the height of the kernel of the convolution respectively."

We want to stress, though, that the main downside of using a full convolution is that it takes many full convolutional layers and/or very big kernels to get a high upsampling ratio. For most of the models we explored in this work, as we will discuss more in detail in Section 3, this alternative proved to be too expensive in terms of both memory usage and computational time to be considered viable."

It is important to highlight that the prediction coming from this pathway is only used to compute the gradient and is not taken into account to determine the actual output of the network."

In this work we focus on foreground/background segmentation, and build the appropriate masks from the more complex maps provided by the dataset by creating a new map which preserves the background class as 0, and sets pixels which belong to all other classes to 1.

      "text" : "Adding prior knowledge by augmenting the given data with transformed versions is well known to help generalization (see, e.g., Krizhevsky et al., 2012). In light of this, we decided to employ several methods of data augmentation: flipping, shifting, color flipping, and resizing.\nFor each sample there was a 50% chance to flip the image horizontally. This mirrors the intuition that images which are inverted horizontally generally seem like the same scene visually.\nThe shifting procedure was as follows: we either moved 2 pixels to the left with 25% chance, 2 pixels to the right with 25% chance, or performed no shifting. After this step, we then shifted up with 25% chance, shifted down with 25% chance, or left the image as is was before this step. This augmentation should make the model more robust to slight shifts of the object in the image.\nWhen working with gray-scale images, another augmentation which can be useful is to randomly invert the color of the image changing darker colors into lighter colors and vice-versa, with some change percentage. This is helpful in cases where there are more dark objects than light or vice versa, and it proved to be especially helpful when working with greyscale versions of the Weizmann Horse dataset to improve the segmentation performance of light horses that are less represented in the dataset.\nResizing of images can also be of benefit, as eliminating unnecessary and easily explained variance can help the model focus on harder to model characteristics, which generally leads to better performance on the task at hand, especially in the case of segmentation where object scale between images has little impact on the class category. A common choice for resizing is to resize every image to the mean width and height, calculated over the entire dataset of variable size images.\nIt should be noted that all transformations which involve changes in dimensionality or position must also be applied in some inverse form to the predicted segmentation mask to compare it with the ground truth, and great care must be taken (especially during resizing/shifting) not to introduce unexpected errors. It is also paramount to highlight that it is the prediction that should be resized to the ground truth size and not the opposite, not to misrepresent the segmentation accuracy.\nAll of these possible augmentation procedures were treated as hyperparameters for training, and selected based on the best validation performance per dataset."

The parameters that describe the core of the proposed ReSeg model are the number of features (dRE) of each sublayer and the size of the patches they read (wp × hp), the numbers of ReSeg layer nl employed, the kind of upsampling strategy adopted (see 2.3) and its parameters (e.g. the number of convolutions nc, their kernel size wck × hck and stride wcs × hcs and their activation ac), if any intermediate prediction pathway has been added to the topology and in which point of the network. We tried many combinations of hyperparameters, but in the reported experiments the number of features dRE was between 50 and 300, the patch size wp × hp was always 2 × 2, the number of layers 2, and the upsampling strategy we chose was either linear fully-connected or gradient-based.\nAnother important hyperparameter is the kind of preprocessing techniques applied on the input data and the training parameters such as the initialization strategy of each component, the batch size b, the amount of weight decay wd, the amount of weight noise wn, the gradient clipping threshold gc, the learning rate lr and the optimization algorithm used to adapt the learning rate.

      "text" : "The first ingredient to training neural networks is initialization. In this paper, we utilized the fan-in plus fan-out initialization described in Glorot & Bengio (2010) for all feedforward and convolutional initializations. The recurrent weight matrices were initialized to be orthonormal, following the procedure defined in Saxe et al. (2014).\nAn adaptive learning rate algorithm known as Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2014) was a key ingredient to stable learning, though others such as (Zeiler, 2012) were useful during model development. In addition, we also utilized gradient norm rescaling to help with the problems described in (Bengio et al., 2013).\nRegularization proved to be another important part of our process, especially on the smaller Weizmann Horse dataset. Weight noise, as described in Graves (2011), with a scale 0.075 was applied to all weight matrices before each forward pass during some experiments. Dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) on each forward connection with drop probability of 0.2 on the input, and/or with drop probability of 0.5 on the hidden projections was applied during some experiments. Nearly all experiments used L2 regularization (Krogh & Hertz, 1992), also known as weight decay, set to 0.0005 to avoid instability at the end of training. The effect of Batch Normalization in Recurrent Neural Networks has been recently in the focus of attention in Laurent et al. (2015) and since it does not seem to provide a reliable improvement in performances we decided not to adopt it.\nMany experiments were performed using a minibatch size of 1. When computational constraints allowed, we also used larger batch sizes of 5, 10, 20, 35, and 50. Larger batch sizes greatly smoothed learning (as expected), and removed some issues related to spurious occurrences in the datasets such as misaligned or poorly segmented groundtruth masks.\nmPA mJI Model – 88.33% (Yang et al., 2015) 94.65% 79.30% ReSeg – 64.23% (Rother et al., 2004)? 77.74% 0.0% All background baseline 22.26% 22.26% All foreground baseline\n(b) Fashionista\n? as reported by (Yang et al., 2015)"

To learn model parameters, an update rule based on iterations over training is used, and the best model is generally chosen by evaluating a secondary stopping criterion on a held out validation set. Once this is complete, the best model is evaluated over the never before seen test set. It is not always clear\nThis general procedure is very different than a leave-one-out or k-fold crossvalidation scheme, as is common in much of the segmentation literature, and ”losing” data to a validation set is especially painful in limited data setups such as the three reported experiments. Nonetheless we report our scores in line with approaches which use other training schemes, as we think the performance metrics are viable regardless of the exact methodology. As hardware capabilities continue to improve, other training schemes such as k-fold crossvalidation should become more viable."

This corruption was present over several machines on different networks, so it appears to be a problem in the dataset itself, rather than the transfer to our machines. For larger datasets, this kind of corruption will not make a large difference in the overall performance accuracy, but for small evaluation sets such as Weizmann Horse (128 images) and Oxford Flowers (197 images), a corruption of one or two images could result in large performance shifts. It is not clear whether this corruption is recent, but we contacted several of the cited authors to find out whether the issues we found were also present during their analysis and, if so, to know how the reported results were collected. It is also important to note that this issue has far less impact when adopting a k-fold or leave one out approaches, which are usually not a viable solution for large neural models.\nIn our case the 2 corrupted Oxford Flowers masks were not interpretable, so we were forced to remove those masks and the corresponding images in our procedures. For Weizmann Horse instead, one error is a blank RGB input image (image 318), with a mask corresponding to a valid horse. Interestingly the gray scale version of the same image is present. Furthermore, a nearby RGB image (317) appears to have been replaced with its gray scale version. Not having any way to tell if the models we compete with suffered from the same problems, we opted for a conservative approach and we left these images in the dataset. We will update the paper and the results if we will receive more information about this from the authors we contacted."

The success of a ReSeg based architecture on this task has shown that recurrent neural networks can be a viable alternative to energy based, parts based, or application specific models, even when these models are combined with the power of a deep pretrained CNN. We hope these results will encourage continued work in applying neural models to segmentation tasks, and plan to tackle larger and more modern datasets for segmentation using similar techniques."

The proposed network, called ReSeg, is based on the recently introduced ReNet model for object classification. We modify and extend it to perform object segmentation, noting that the avoidance of pooling can greatly simplify pixel-wise tasks for images. The ReSeg layer is composed of four recurrent neural networks that sweep the image horizontally and vertically in both directions, along with a final layer that expands the prediction back to the original image size. ReSeg combines multiple ReSeg layers with several possible input layers as well as a final layer which expands the prediction back to the original image size, making it suitable for a variety of structured prediction tasks. We evaluate ReSeg on the specific task of object segmentation with three widely-used image segmentation datasets, namely Weizmann Horse, Fashionista and Oxford Flower. The results suggest that ReSeg can challenge the state of the art in object segmentation, and may have further applications in structured prediction at large.",
