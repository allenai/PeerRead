      "text" : "Syllogism is a type of deductive reasoning involving quantified statements. The syllogistic reasoning scheme in the classical Aristotelian framework involves three crisp term sets and four linguistic quantifiers, for which the main support is the linguistic properties of the quantifiers. A number of fuzzy approaches for defining an approximate syllogism have been proposed for which the main support is cardinality calculus. In this paper we analyze fuzzy syllogistic models previously described by Zadeh and Dubois et al. and compare their behavior with that of the classical Aristotelian framework to check which of the 24 classical valid syllogistic reasoning patterns (called moods) are particular crisp cases of these fuzzy approaches. This allows us to assess to what extent these approaches can be considered as either plausible extensions of the classical crisp syllogism or a basis for a general approach to the problem of approximate syllogism.\nKeywords: syllogistic reasoning, fuzzy quantifiers"

      "text" : "Syllogistic inference or syllogism is a type of deductive reasoning in which all the statements involved are quantified propositions. A well-known example of a syllogism is the one shown in Table 1, where P1 denotes the major or first premise, P2 the minor or second premise, and C the conclusion.\nEmail addresses: martin.pereira@usc.es (M. Pereira-Fariña), felix.diaz@usc.es (F. Dı́az-Hermida), alberto.bugarin.diz@usc.es (A. Bugaŕın)\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier December 1, 2014\nA quantified proposition involves two main elements: a quantifier (such as all, many, 25, 25%, double. . . that of. . . ) and terms, usually interpreted as sets. In the typical binary quantified statement, the subject is the “restriction” of the quantifier and the predicate its “scope”. For instance, for P1 in the example in Table 1, human beings is the restriction and mortal is the scope of the all quantifier.\nThe classical approach to syllogism was developed by Aristotle [1], who considered four crisp quantifiers: all (A), none (E ), some (I ), and not all (O). These quantifiers are defined accordingly to the linguistic properties in the logic square of opposition (LSO) [2] shown in Figure 1.\nWith respect to the structure of inferences, the classical syllogism comprises reasoning patterns involving two premises with a term in common (the so-called middle term) and a conclusion that involves the terms that are not shared between the premises (major term and minor term). The position of the middle term in the premises allows the definition of four different structures known as figures (Table 2).\nConsidering the four crisp quantifiers and the four figures together leads to 24 correct inference schemes called Aristotelian moods. All these valid cases\nare shown in Table 3. They are described using the classical notation in which each mood is denoted by the symbols for the quantifiers involved, which are the major premise, the minor premise and the conclusion, respectively. For example, mood AAA for Figure I refers to the reasoning scheme for the example in Table 1.\nTwo alternative approaches have been used in the literature to endow the classical syllogism with more expressive capabilities: (i) addition of new crisp [3] or fuzzy [4, 5, 6] quantifiers (but preserving the number of premises) or (ii) addition of more statements to the set of premises [7] (but only considering the four classical quantifiers).\nWe focus our analysis on models that follow the first alternative, in which quantifiers are extended for inclusion of fuzzy expressions, such as many, most, a few, between approximately 25% and 30%,. . . , since this is the closest approach to classical Aristotelian models from the point of view of both syntax and set-based interpretation of the terms.\nDubois et al. [5, 8, 9] proposed a framework in which fuzzy quantifiers are represented as intervals, as shown in the example in Table 4.\nUsing earlier results [5, 8], Dubois et al. took the first step in developing a fuzzy linguistic syllogism that is closer to the Aristotelian viewpoint than other approaches [9].\nZadeh [4] defined fuzzy syllogism as “an inference scheme in which the major premise, the minor premise and the conclusion are propositions containing fuzzy quantifiers.” Thus, fuzzy syllogism comprises two premises and a conclusion involving quantifiers that are different to those in the LSO. A typical example of Zadeh’s fuzzy syllogism is shown in Table 5. The quantifier of the conclusion, Most2 := Most⊗Most, is calculated from the quantifiers in the premises by applying the quantifier extension principle (QEP) [10], in this case using the fuzzy arithmetic product.\nClosely related to this interpretation, Yager proposed a number of syllogistic schemes that are extensions or variants of Zadeh’s framework [11]. These approaches are very similar and therefore the conclusions of our analysis also directly apply to them.\nBoth approaches have been analyzed in detail in the literature [12, 13]. Spies considered all the models proposed by Zadeh from the point of view of their basic definitions [12]. These models are syllogisms with a middle term that can be categorized into two classes:\n1. Property inheritance (asymmetric syllogism): the link between the subject and the predicate of the conclusion is semantic. Thus, a term set X and a term set Z are linked via concatenation of X with a term set Y and Y with Z.\n2. Combination of evidence (symmetric syllogism): the link between the subject and the predicate of the conclusion is syntactic, not semantic.\nThus, the links between X and Z and between Y and Z are calculated separately and they are joined in the conclusion by a logic operator (conjunction/disjunction).\nHowever, neither the disadvantages that QEP presents nor their compatibility with classical syllogisms are considered. Liu and Kerre analyzed the approaches of Zadeh and Dubois et al. in depth considering their multiple dimensions [13].\nIn this study we evaluate the capability of both fuzzy frameworks to comprise and reproduce Aristotelian moods as particular (crisp) cases. We expand the analysis of Pereira-Fariña et al. [14] and describe each of the syllogistic patterns in detail in terms of both their inferences schemes and the problems that arise when considering the classical inferences patterns.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 analyzes the reasoning patterns of Dubois et al. Section 3 analyzes the behavior of Zadeh’s patterns. In Section 4, we summarize our conclusions and propose future work."

      "text" : "Dubois and co-workers proposed an approach to syllogistic reasoning that is based on the interpretation of linguistic quantifiers as intervals; that is, a quantifier Q = [ q, q ] , where q denotes the lower bound and q denotes the upper bound [5, 8]. Since this model focuses on managing proportional quantifiers (such as most, many, some, between 25% and 34%,. . . ) we have that q, q ∈ [0, 1]. An illustrative example of this type of syllogistic reasoning is shown in Table 4.\nThis interval approach and the Aristotelian approach have methodological differences. Aristotle manages and proves all his moods using natural logic, which involves using natural language as a logic language [7]. The approach of Dubois et al. is based on maximization and minimization of an interval (associated with the conclusion) according to other intervals given by the premises. We analyze this approach by dividing it into two parts: (i) the quantification framework; and (ii) the theory of inference."

Precise quantifiers: quantifiers whose values are precisely known and have precise bounds; for example, 10% of animals are mammals and 30% of young students are tall. In this case, the lower and upper bounds of the interval coincide (q = q).\n3. Fuzzy quantifiers: quantifiers whose bounds are ill defined and are imprecise and fuzzy; for example, most Spanish cars are new and a few elephants are pets. Fuzzy quantifiers are represented using a fuzzy number defined through the usual four-point trapezoidal representation\nQi = { q∗i, qi, qi, q ∗ i } , where SUPQi := [q∗i, q ∗ i ] represents the support\nof Qi and KERQi := [ q i , qi ] its core."

It is relevant to note that the links among all three predicates involved have to be fully known (i.e., the relationships between A and B and vice versa and between B and C and vice versa are needed to infer as a conclusion the relationships between A and C and vice versa).\nFor precise quantifiers, the quantifier of the conclusion Q := [ q, q ] is\ncalculated from Q1 := [ q1, q1 ] and Q2 := [ q2, q2 ] and the corresponding Q′1\nand Q′2 using the following expressions: 1\nq = q1·max (\n0, 1− 1− q2 q′1\n) (1)\nq = min ( 1, 1− q1 +\nq1· q2 q′1 , q1· q2 q′1· q′2 , q1· q2 q′1· q′2\n[1− q′2 + q1] ) .

Table 8 shows an illustrative example of a particular Pattern II.\n1Calculation of Q′ is identical. For details of the proof, refer to [5, 8].\nPattern III has also two linguistic versions (Table 9). The differences between them are the same as for Pattern II, although the number of premises changes: the general Pattern III has the same six premises but the particular one has two. Table 10 shows an example of a particular Pattern III.\nWe can observe from the linguistic schemes for both patterns that they have a symmetric-type structure [12]; that is, the core of the reasoning process is the and logic operator.

Some linguistic quantifiers (e.g. some) can be either absolute or proportional, depending on the context.\nZadeh interpreted linguistic quantifiers as fuzzy numbers [10]. Therefore, absolute quantifiers are identified with absolute fuzzy numbers and proportional quantifiers with proportional fuzzy numbers.\nThe procedure proposed for combining fuzzy numbers with the corresponding fuzzy sets represented in the properties is the well-known ΣCount scalar cardinality for fuzzy sets [10, 15]. It is relevant to note that the Aristotelian approach and Zadeh’s approach exhibit methodological differences.

According to the general scheme shown in Table 13, they can only be combined into inferences with two premises and a conclusion.\n2Liu and Kerre discuss the most relevant problems generated by the use of QEP and fuzzy arithmetic in Zadeh’s framework [13].\nThe inference process is based on QEP, which establishes that:\nif C = f(P1;P2; . . . ;Pn), then Q = φf (Q1;Q2; . . . ;Qn), (3)\nwhere C is the conclusion, P1;P2; . . . ;Pn are the premises, f is a function, Q is the quantifier of the conclusion, Q1;Q2; . . . ;Qn are the quantifiers of the premises and φf is an extension of f obtained using the extension principle.\nThe main idea of QEP is to apply the extension principle to f to obtain a fuzzy function φf that can be directly applied to the corresponding fuzzy numbers. Since fuzzy numbers are managed, the corresponding arithmetic operations must be performed using fuzzy arithmetic.\nNow we analyze each of the syllogistic inference patterns proposed by Zadeh that emerge from the general pattern (Table 13).

Three terms are involved that play the following roles: A and C constitute the conclusion, where A is the subject and C is the predicate, and B is the “link” between these two terms that makes it possible to infer a coherence conclusion. Since\nthe terms of the conclusion are “chained” by a middle term, this pattern is called a chaining pattern.\nFurthermore, it is worth noting that there is a constraint between A and B; that is, B ⊆ A, i.e. µB (ui) ≤ µA (ui) , ui ∈ U, i = 1, . . .. This constraint can be expressed as an additional quantified statement: “all Bs as As”. This constraint is relevant because it allows us to know the distribution of the elements in the sets A and B; without this information, the conclusion cannot be calculated.\nTaking all the previous considerations into account, the procedure for calculating the conclusion is shown in Equation (4), where ⊗ denotes a fuzzy product and thus the chaining pattern is multiplicative."

We can consider this model as a variant of the MC pattern in Section 3.2.1 where the constraint “B ⊆ A” is substituted by the reversibility of the first premise; i.e., “Q1 As are Bs↔ Q1 Bs are As”. Zadeh points out that this semantic equivalence is approximate rather than exact; the calculation of how “approximate” it can be remains a nontrivial open question [16].\nNevertheless, there is a remarkable obstacle for this constraint. For proportional quantifiers, it does not hold that a quantified sentence (e.g., “most American cars are big”) and another sentence with the arguments interchanged (“most big cars are American”) are semantically equivalent. It is true, when talking about absolute quantifiers, that such semantic equivalence holds (e.g., “around a hundred thousand American cars are big” is semantically equivalent to “around a hundred thousand big cars are American”).\nThe procedure for calculating the conclusion, shown in Equation (5), involves fuzzy addition (⊕) and subtraction ( ).\nq ≥ max (0, q1 ⊕ q2 1) .

First, it is worth noting that all the moods are of the property inheritance type (asymmetric syllogisms); therefore, the structure of Zadeh’s symmetric syllogistic patterns is not adequate.

Regarding their capability to reproduce the four classical figures, only Figure I is compatible, as shown in Table 19, because of the position of the middle term.\nAs a consequence, none of the classical Figures II, III and IV can be modeled using this approach. This limits the scope of the model and therefore comparison to the six Aristotelian moods in Figure I. Zadeh’s patterns are compared with these six moods in Table 20. Only the AII mood is compatible with the MPR scheme (i.e., one mood out of 12).\nThe problem in the MC pattern is in the constraint B ⊆ A in the first premise (minor premise in Aristotelian terms), which is much too restrictive. In this set of Aristotelian moods, the converse of the minor premise in linguistic terms is, “some Bs are A”; that is, A∪B 6= ∅; for instance, in the AII mood, B ⊆ A cannot be inferred from the statement I: some As are Bs. This condition is less restrictive than Zadeh’s and therefore many of the possible inferences dismissed by Zadeh’s pattern can be solved using the Aristotelian framework.\nThe MPR pattern is only valid for the AII mood since the statement and its converse in the minor premise have the same quantifier (“some”). For the other moods, those that include A in the minor premise present the same problem as in the MC pattern. The solution of the EIO mood, which\nis compatible, presents a problem: the value obtained for Q is 0 instead of [0, 1− ) with ∈ (0, 1], the usual representation for the quantifier “not all” in a proportional interpretation. The origin of this problem is that Zadeh’s framework is not capable of managing moods involving decreasing quantifiers such as “not all”.\nIn conclusion, Zadeh’s approach to syllogistic reasoning is compatible with the AII mood of Aristotelian syllogism but only for the MPR scheme."

While the model of Dubois et al. is consistent with all six moods in Figure I, Zadeh’s MPR scheme is only consistent for one mood out of six and his MC approach is consistent with none of the six moods. Furthermore, none of the models is compatible with the other classical Figures II, III and IV, which involve 18 moods.\nTherefore, from this point of view, the proposal of Dubois et al. can be properly considered as a plausible fuzzy extension that comprises some of the classical cases as particular instances. Therefore, this proposal could be considered as a basis for defining a more general approach to syllogistic reasoning that involves, for example, the other moods currently excluded and/or other types of quantifier used in the linguistics field [17], such as comparative (e.g., there are approximately three more tall people than blond people) and exception (e.g., all except three students are tall quantifiers)."

The syllogistic reasoning scheme in the classical Aristotelian framework involves three crisp term sets and four linguistic quantifiers, for which the main support is the linguistic properties of the quantifiers. A number of fuzzy approaches for defining an approximate syllogism have been proposed for which the main support is cardinality calculus. In this paper we analyze fuzzy syllogistic models previously described by Zadeh and Dubois et al. and compare their behavior with that of the classical Aristotelian framework to check which of the 24 classical valid syllogistic reasoning patterns (called moods) are particular crisp cases of these fuzzy approaches. This allows us to assess to what extent these approaches can be considered as either plausible extensions of the classical crisp syllogism or a basis for a general approach to the problem of approximate syllogism.",
