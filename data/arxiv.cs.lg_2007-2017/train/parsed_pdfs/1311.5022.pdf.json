However, such strategies are provably suboptimal or computationally inefficient. The complexity is attributed to the combinatorial structure of the action set and the dearth of efficient exploration strategies of the set. Mirror descent with entropic regularization function comes close to solving this problem by enforcing a meticulous projection of weights with an inherent boundary condition. Entropic regularization in mirror descent is the only known way of achieving a logarithmic dependence on the dimension. Here, we argue otherwise and recover the original intuition of exponential weighting by borrowing a technique from discrete optimization and approximation algorithms called ‘extended formulation’. Such formulations appeal to the underlying geometry of the set with a guaranteed logarithmic dependence on the dimension underpinned by an information theoretic entropic analysis. We show that with such formulations, exponential weighting can achieve logarithmic dependence on the dimension of the set."

      "text" : "Online linear optimization is a natural generalization of the the basic adversarial (non-stochastic) or worst case multiarm bandit framework (Auer et al., 2002), to the domain of convex optimization, where the set of actions is replaced by a compact action set A ⊂ Rd and the loss is a linear function on the action set A.\nDespite being a compelling and widely used framework, the problems become challenging to address when the fore-\nPreliminary work.

In this case, the forecaster’s action at every round is an element of the combinatorial space. Examples of such problems are maximum weight cut in a graph (Goemans & Williamson, 1995), planted clique problem (Garey & Johnson, 1979) and others. For instance, in the spanning trees with Kclique problem, the number of spanning trees of a clique of K elements is exponential in K, hence the size of the all possible actions in the action set is also exponential in K (Cesa-Bianchi & Lugosi, 2012). Such combinatorial optimization problems have general tractability issues (Goemans & Williamson, 1995). Online linear optimization techniques prove good in such problems when the number of actions N is exponential in the natural parameters of the problem. However, with partial or bandit feedback, such techniques have suboptimal regret bounds. The best known bound is of the order d2 √ n (Bubeck et al., 2012) with a computationally hard John’s exploration technique (Ball, 1997). Specifically, in the line of research of online combinatorial optimization, we address the following open questions posed by Bubeck et al. (2012). For the combinatorial bandit optimization where actions are d-dimensional, can we have an optimal regret bound with a computationally efficient strategy? Is there a natural way one can characterize the combinatorial action sets for which such optimal regret bounds are obtained under bandit feedback?\nWe address this question by using a notion from convex optimization that attributes the complexity of the problem in computing a complex set, to an efficient representation of the set. We employ techniques from non-negative and semi-definite linear programming to exploit the natural combinatorial structure of the problem. Particularly, we use a technique called ‘extended formulation’- a lift and projection technique where the complicated combinatorial convex set (action set) is approximated by a simpler convex set whose linear image is the original convex set (Gouveia et al., 2011). Particularly, we are interested in the approximation of the convex set based on the orthant or semidefinite/non-negative cone that has an associated natural barrier penalty (Nesterov et al., 1994; Chandrasekaran & Jordan, 2013). This technique shows that weaker approximations can lead to improved performance on the combinatorial optimization. Further, such hierarchy of approximations can naturally characterize the action sets for which ar X iv :1\n31 1.\n50 22\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n2 0\nN ov\n2 01\n3\n110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163\n165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219\noptimal regret bounds can be attained."

      "text" : "Specifically, our contributions are the following:\n• We present the “extended” exponential weighted algorithm. Our algorithm has an exponential weighting technique for the different actions; the weights in every round form the slack matrix (extended formulation). The minimum non-negative rank-r factorization, r d, (d is the dimensionality of the problem) of the slack matrix in every round guides the exploration of the set.\n• We introduce an inherent regularity measure by which the actions are weighted, that is a strikingly good indicator of the regret gap. Our method defines slack variables or inequalities given by the linear scalar loss at every round. The notion of non-negative ‘slack’ based regularization, measures the distance of each vertex (in geometric intuition, vertex corresponds to action) in the set from the origin, given the distance from the hyperplane (loss observed) and the vertex played in every iteration. The regularization penalizes for being too far away from either the loss or the last action played for exploitation while revealing boundary information (distance from origin) for exploration.\n• As an interesting consequence of the existence of the slack matrix, we show a minimum rank-r; r d sampling technique that guides the exploration and the unbiased loss estimator. In the setting of extended formulations, we analyse the notion of dimension complexity as the measure of complexity of matrices involved.\n• Our theoretical analysis is an indicator that entropic bounds exist beyond mirror descent based regularization. Contrary to the projection of the weights of the actions as in mirror descent, we use a counter-intuitive notion to lift and extend the complex action set itself to higher dimensions, take a simplified linear projection of this lift and work there. We confirm the computational advantage of the extended formulation over the existing exponential weighted techniques through empirical results on simulated and real dataset."

      "text" : "Dani et al. (2008) showed that optimal regret bounds of the order of O( √ n) (where n is the number of rounds) was first obtained by using a variant of the original adversarial bandit Exp3 (Auer et al., 1995) strategy. Their strategy explored the set of actions uniformly over a barycentric spanner by selecting actions that are separated by a maximum\ndistance. They also showed that without further assumptions, for √ dn log |A|, the bound is not improvable for A = [−1, 1]d. This exploration strategy was later refined by Bianchi et al. (2012), for combinatorial symmetric action sets |A| by using a bounded L∞ loss assumption and using a uniform distribution over the actions, while proving that the regret bound of the order √ nd |A| is not improvable in general for concrete choices of A; but the bound is suboptimal in path planning problem. In both Dani et al. (2008) and Bianchi et al. (2012), the forecaster strategy is based on the probability distribution as in Exp3 by Auer (1995). However, for a set of k arms, Exp3 scales with √ nN lnn, and for discretised k into d as in the combinatorial setting, N possible actions is exponential in d. This work was completed by Bubeck et al. (2012), where an optimal exploration using John’s theorem (Ball, 1997) from convex geometry is used on an adaptation of Exp3 called Exp2, to obtain optimal regret bound of √ dn logA for any set of finite actions.\nSimultaneously, there are other results in the same direction of research using gradient descent, mirror descent and perturbation approaches (Bubeck & Cesa-Bianchi, 2012). Using mirror descent for online linear optimization with bandit feedback on a computationally efficient strategy was provided by (Abernethy et al., 2008) using self concordant barriers. This approach enforced a natural barrier based on the local geometry of the convex set to determine the optimal distance of exploration inside the convex hull of the action set. However, this strategy results in a suboptimal dependency on the dimension d of the action set given by O(d2 √ n) with bounded scalar loss assumption. This result is improved by Bubeck (2012) using Exp2 strategy to attain O(d √ n). However, Audibert (2011) proved that Exp2 is a provably suboptimal strategy in the combinatorial setting. Their work showed that when the action set is combinatorial A ⊂ [0, 1]d and loss L = [0, 1]d, the minimax regret in the full information and semi-bandit case is of the order d √ n while with bandit feedback the order is the sub-optimal d3/2 √ n. The optimal regret bound is also obtained by the mirror descent strategies on the simplex and the Euclidean ball action sets. OSMD for the Euclidean ball in Bubeck (2012), (Ball, 1997), achieves regret of the order √ dn. For more information on combinatorial linear optimization, interested reader may refer (Bubeck & Cesa-Bianchi, 2012). Cesa Bianchi et al. have established in (2012), the unified analysis of mirror descent and fixed share of weights between experts in the online setting. Although, they have showed a logarithmic dependence on the dimension for the generalized case, our work is different in that we capture the loss estimation and show that in cases, the dependency is logarithmic on r where r d. However, our analysis of the oblivious adversary is close to their analysis for the generalized adversary on the simplex.\n220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273\n275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329\nAlthough, efficient in terms of playing the optimal strategy, the exponentially weighted techniques are computationally and provably sub-optimal given the complexity of the action set and the tools used for performing the exploration. One can question if the non-triviality is in reality much more fundamental and obvious than that. From the knowledge of convex optimization, one knows that the complexity of a convex set is associated to how well the set is represented. A sufficiently complex set can be efficiently represented as a combination of low complexity simpler sets. The added complexity associated with the simplification is offset by the low order complexity of the overall simplified problem. Our work here follows this intuition and line of research."

Where possible, the extended formulation or its approximation, simplifies the computing complexity associated with the problem in the linear programming paradigm. Yannakakis’s (1991) seminal work naturally characterizes the size of the extended formulation by giving the smallest size of the extension that represents the original set well. The recent work of Gouveia et al. (2011) and Fiorini et al. (2012) generalizes the theorem from linear programming paradigm for convex optimization. The techniques are also known as lift-and-project (Balas et al., 1993) and approximation techniques (Chandrasekaran & Jordan, 2013). Our work employs this striking technique to the online linear optimization setting to exploit the underlying geometry in the hope of recovering some structure in the combinatorial action set.

We know that a singular value decomposition of the pseudo inverse matrix P−1t is P −1 t = ∑r i=1 1 λi viv T i , where 1 λi\n’s are the singular values, with λis being the non-negative real eigenvalues and vi’s are the orthonormal vectors. Hence, we have for log ( P−1t at ) = log ((∑r i=1 1 λi viv T i ) at ) . In order to maximize this, we consider the minimim singular value that is lower bounded by λi ≥ αr from the definition of pi,t. With ∑t t=1 ||at||1 = Bt, we get the required bound on the third term.

The environment is an oblivious adversary to the player’s actions, simulated to choose fixed but unknown losses at each round. Losses are bounded and in the range [0, 1]. The learning algorithm is executed using our basic Extended Exp algorithm. Each action is represented a d-dimension incidence vector, with 1 indicating if an edge or path is present in the route or 0 otherwise. Figure 3 displays the results of the cases where d = 10, 15 and d = 20. The performance measure is the instantaneous regret over time; we use psuedo regret here. The number of iterations in the game are 10000 for d = 10 and 100 for d = 15. In both cases, the results are averaged over 100 runs of the games.

We do not make the ratings available to the algorithm, instead the ratings are provided by the environment based on the user. In other words, we assume the non-oblivious setting for the adversary, the loss changes with the user or action selected.

The exponential weighted strategy achieves the best known regret bound that is of the order of d √ n (where d is the dimension of the problem, n is the time horizon ). However, such strategies are provably suboptimal or computationally inefficient. The complexity is attributed to the combinatorial structure of the action set and the dearth of efficient exploration strategies of the set. Mirror descent with entropic regularization function comes close to solving this problem by enforcing a meticulous projection of weights with an inherent boundary condition. Entropic regularization in mirror descent is the only known way of achieving a logarithmic dependence on the dimension. Here, we argue otherwise and recover the original intuition of exponential weighting by borrowing a technique from discrete optimization and approximation algorithms called ‘extended formulation’. Such formulations appeal to the underlying geometry of the set with a guaranteed logarithmic dependence on the dimension underpinned by an information theoretic entropic analysis. We show that with such formulations, exponential weighting can achieve logarithmic dependence on the dimension of the set.",
