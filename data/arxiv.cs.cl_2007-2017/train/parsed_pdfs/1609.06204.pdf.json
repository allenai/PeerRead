      "text" : "In recent years, the Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies have become a fundamental basis for complex tasks, such as Question Answering, Event Identification and Topic Classification. While most of the NLP tools freely available on the web (such as Stanford CoreNLP1 and OpenNLP2) are designed for English and sometimes adapted to other languages, there is a lack of this kind of resources for Italian.\nIn this paper, we present Tint, a suite of readyto-use modules for NLP that is:\nNew. Tint is the first completely free and open source tool for NLP in Italian.\nSimple. Tint can be downloaded and used out-ofthe-box (see Section 5). In addition, it relies on Stanford CoreNLP Java interface, therefore it can be included easily into an existing project.\n1http://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/ 2 https://opennlp.apache.org/\nModular. Tint can be extended using the CoreNLP Java interfaces. At the same time, existing modules can be replaced with more customized ones.\nEfficient. In its default configuration, Tint is faster than most of its competitors (see Section 4).\nAccurate. Most of Tint modules have a state-ofthe-art accuracy (see Section 4).\nFree. Tint is released as open source software under GNU GPL."

The framework provides also an easy interface to extend the annotation to new tasks and/or languages. Differently from some similar tools, such as UIMA (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004) and GATE (Cunningham et al., 2002), CoreNLP is easy to use and does not require it to be learnt: a basic object-oriented programming skill is enough. In Tint, we use this framework to both port the most common NLP tasks to Italian and add some new annotators for external tools, such as entity linking, temporal expression identification, keyword extraction."

At first, the text is grossly tokenized; in a second step, tokens that need to be put together are merged using two customizable lists of Italian non-breaking abbreviations (such as “dott.” or “S.p.A.”) and regular expressions (for email addresses, web URIs, numbers, dates)."

The current version of this module has been trained with the Morph-it lexicon (Zanchetta and Baroni, 2005), but it’s possible to extend or retrain it with other Italian datasets. In order to grant fast performance, the model storage has been implemented with the mapDB Java library3 that provides an excellent variation of the Cassandra’s Sorted String Table. To extend the coverage of the results, especially for the complex forms, such as “porta-ce-ne”, “portar-glie-lo” or “bi-direzionale”, the module tries to decompose the token into prefix-root-infix-suffix and attempts to resolve the root form."

In order to increase the accuracy of the results, the module tries to detect the genre of noun lemmas relying to the analysis of their processed articles. For instance, for the correct lemmatization of “il latte/the milk”, the module uses the singular article “il” to identify the correct gender/number of the lemma “latte” and returns “latte/milk” (male, singular) instead of “latta/metal sheet” (female, which plural form is “latte”).\n3http://www.mapdb.org 4 http://universaldependencies.org/"

In some cases, an evaluation based on the accuracy is not possible, because of the lack of available gold standard or because the tool outcome is not comparable to other tools’ ones.\nWhen possible, Tint is compared with existing pipelines that work with the Italian language: Tanl (Attardi et al., 2010), TextPro (Pianta et al., 2008) and TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994).\nIn calculating speed, we run each experiment 10 times and consider the average execution time. When available, multi-thread capabilities have been disabled. All experiments have been executed on a 2,3 GHz Intel Core i7 with 16 GB of memory.\nThe Tanl API is not available as a downloadable package, but it’s only usable online through a REST API, therefore the speed may be influenced by the network connection. In addition, the Tanl API does not provide offsets for the annotated text, nor it allows a text to be uploaded already tokenized and divided in sentences, therefore an automatic alignment was needed. The tools used for this alignment are distributed as part of the Tint software.\nNo evaluation is performed for the Tint annotators that act as wrappers for an external tools (temporal expression tagging, entity linking, keyword extraction)."

As the tagset used is different for different tools, the accuracy is calculated only on five coarse-grained types: nouns (N), verbs (V), adverbs (B), adjectives (A) and other (O). For each tool, the corresponding tagset is converted to this tagset and accuracy is calculated dividing the number of times the tagger gets the right answer by the total number of tags in the dataset.

When the lemma is guessed starting form a morphological analysis (such as in Tint and TextPro), the speed is calculated by including both tasks. Table 3 shows the results. All the tools reach the same accuracy of 96% (with minor differences that are not statistically significant)."

Both Tanl and TextPro deal also with the GPE class, but we merged it to LOC, as it has been done during the training of Tint. We needed to retrain the EntityPro module of TextPro from scratch (with three classes), as the original model already contains the ICAB test set, therefore it would overfit the results. In training Tint, we add some gazette of names, to help the classifier to recognize entities that are not present in the training set. In particular, we extracted a list of persons, locations and organizations by querying the Airpedia database (Palmero Aprosio et al., 2013) for Wikipedia pages classified as Person, Place and Organisation, respectively. The whole data used for training the NER is available for download from the Tint website. Table 4 shows the results of the named entity recognition task."

While Tint is trained on the UD dataset, the parsers included in Tanl (Attardi et al., 2013) and TextPro (Lavelli, 2013) use part of the Turin University Treebank (TUT) (Bosco et al., 2000), as released for the Evalita 2011 parsing task (Magnini et al., 2013). For this reason, the comparison between the two system is not completely fair: on the one hand, the TUT dataset is smaller than the UD; on the other hand, the UD is an automatic combination of two different treebanks, that have been annotated using different guidelines (Bosco et al., 2013). Table 5 shows the results: the Tint evaluation has been performed on the UD test data; LAS and UAS for TextPro and Tanl is taken directly from the Evalita 2011 proceedings."

Tint accepts plain text or Newsreader Annotation Format (NAF) (Fokkens et al., 2014) as input, and CoNLL, JSON, or NAF as output."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion and Future Work",
      "text" : "In this paper we presented Tint, a simple, fast and accurate NLP pipeline for Italian, based on Stanford CoreNLP. Currently, we offer out-of-the-box NLP annotation for part-of-speech, lemma, named entities, links to Wikipedia, dependency parsing, time expression identification and keyword extraction; additional custom modules can be added and replaced easily by implementing the CoreNLP Java interfaces.\nIn the future, we plan to better tune the various modules that rely on machine learning (such as dependency parsing, part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition), that in this preliminary version of Tint have been trained without any linguistic optimization.\nWe are currently working on new modules, in particular Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) w.r.t. linguistic resources such as MultiWordNet (Pianta et al., 2002) and Semantic Role Labelling, by porting to Italian resources such as Framenet (Baker et al., 1998), now available in English.\nOn the technical side, we are updating some modules to work multi-thread. The Tint pipeline will also be integrated into PIKES (Corcoglioniti et al., 2016), a tool that extracts knowledge from texts using NLP annotation and outputs it in a queryable form (such RDF triples)."
