      "text" : "solving approaches. The point of focus today is knowledge and service production with more emphasis been laid on knowledge capital. Many organizations\nare investing on tools that facilitate knowledge sharing among their employees and they are as well promoting and encouraging collaboration among their staff\nin order to build the organization’s knowledge capital with the ultimate goal of creating a lasting competitive advantage for their organizations. One of the\ncurrent leading approaches used for solving organization’s decision problem is the Economic Intelligence (EI) approach which involves interactions among\nvarious actors called EI actors. These actors collaborate to ensure the overall success of the decision problem solving process. In the course of the\ncollaboration, the actors express knowledge which could be capitalized for future reuse. In this paper, we propose in the first place, an annotation model for\nknowledge elicitation among EI actors. Because of the need to build a knowledge capital, we also propose a dynamic knowledge capitalisation approach for\nmanaging knowledge produced by the actors. Finally, the need to manage the interactions and the interdependencies among collaborating EI actors, led to our\nthird proposition which constitute an awareness mechanism for group work management."

      "text" : "1 Introduction Economic Intelligence (EI) approach is a means of resolving decision problems based not only on information gathering but also on the interpretation\ngiven by the concerned actors (called EI actors) on the extracted information from available heterogeneous sources. EI concerns the set of concepts, methods,\nand tools which unify all the coordinated actions of research, acquisition, treatment, storage and diffusion of information, relevant to individual or clustered\nenterprises and organizations in the framework of strategy [9]. It is a process that involves information collection, processing and distribution with the goal of\nreducing uncertainty in decision making [14].\nAll the EI phases involve actors who collaborate to produce actionable knowledge for decision making [10] [11]. The actors of importance are mainly\nDecision Maker (DM), EI project coordinator and Information Watcher. They complement each others’ activities in resolving a decision problem. Decision\nmaker is the one capable of identifying and establishing the problem to be solved in terms of stake, of risk or threat on the enterprise [5]. In other words, he\nknows the needs of the organization, the stakes, the eventual risks and the threats the organization can be subjected to [1]. Information watcher is responsible\nfor locating, supervising, validating, and emphasizing the strategic information needed for solving decision problem. He works hand in hand with the decision\nmaker right from the initial stage of making a decision problem explicit. He translates this problem into information search problem so as to begin the\ncollection of relevant information for solving the problem. EI project coordinator acts as an intermediary between all the EI actors in an organization. He is\nresponsible for planning the work flow in EI process and coordinating the interactions among EI actors [10].\nFigure 1 gives an overview of all the stages involved in EI process. For explanation purpose, EI process could be translated into five phases [10]:\n- Translation phase: this phase concerns the identification of a decision problem and translating it to an information search problem. In this phase, the objectives are defined by identifying the stake in decision problem. If the decision problem is not properly identified and not properly translated then\nall the activities involved in the remaining four phases will be a waste [10]. Model for Decision Problem elicitation (MDP) [5] provides a way of\nrepresenting stake. This model comprises of three main parameters for representing stake: the observed object, the signal and the hypothesis\nassociated with the signal.\n- Information search and retrieval phase: this is the information collection phase. After translating a decision problem into an information search problem, there is need to identify relevant information sources, validate these sources and then collect necessary information.\n- Analysis phase: this is an important phase as it allows for processing collected information in order to calculate indicators necessary for decision making. These indicators are to be interpreted.\n- Decision making phase: a proper interpretation of indicators will lead to better decision making.\n- Protection phase: in practice, this phase is not an isolated phase because it is present throughout all the stages of EI process. For the purpose of explanation, we bring it out as a phase. Right from the decision problem identification to the final decision taken, all the expressed information and\ncollected information should be properly protected from unwise divulgation as well as from spies and competitors. This is what we refer to as\nprotection of information patrimony [10]."

However, with asynchronous\nannotation, the members need not communicate in real time. A means of notifying the concerned members of pending messages may however be necessary.\nKnowledge produced in the course of collaboration among actors need to be capitalized for future reuse. Thus, dynamic capitalization of such knowledge is\nimportant. The questions we intend to answer in this paper are:\n• How do we represent, exploit and reuse annotation in EI context? • What is the appropriate knowledge capitalization method? • How do we manage interactions among collaborating EI actors?\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section 1 discusses annotation and annotation representation for knowledge elicitation. Our proposed annotation model\nis discussed in section two. In section three, dynamic knowledge capitalization method is described. Section four describes the management of interactions\namong actors. Section five presents two systems in which the proposed model and methods were implemented. The paper is concluded in section six.\n2 Annotation The term annotation has been deployed and used virtually in all endeavour of life. It is an integral part of interpreting document. However, the definition\nand usage of the term depend on the context of use. Different users employ different annotation forms such as underlining an object of interest, writing on the\nmargins, making a comment, use of some marks such as asterisk, question mark, etc. Annotation made may be explicit or implicit. With explicit annotation,\nthe meaning of the annotation made is assumed to be understood at least by a community of users – users belonging to the same field of study. Unlike explicit\nannotation, the meaning of implicit annotation may be known only to the annotator – the person that makes the annotation.\nAnnotation as object is defined as an intentional and topical value-adding note linked to an extant information object [2]. Annotation is also defined as\n“any object (annotation) that is associated with another object (document) by some relationship” [3]. The definition of annotation by [3] does not only\nconsider annotation as object but also as an action involving anchoring the object with the concerned document. Annotation as action is defined in [15] as an\nact of interpreting a document. It is a process of creating annotation as object and anchoring it to the document object (i.e. information source being\nannotated).\nAnnotation as value-added information can serve as user’s interpretation of document content. It is a method of eliciting knowledge from the annotator by\ncapturing his interpretation on the document of interest [12]. However, there is need to consider the structure such annotation takes. In existing annotation\nsystems, users are constraint to assign values to only already defined attributes. The granularity level of attribute value a user needs may not be available.\nWhere a user specifies an attribute that does not exist, there would be a need for structural changes to the schema of the Information System in order to\naccommodate such new attributes. Such changes might be tedious, time consuming and costly to effect. It is important to note that users’ needs evolve and that\nit is impossible to pre-conceive all possible needs in the design of an information system. Our interest is to represent annotation as attribute-value pair.\nAnnotation as attribute-value pair is a way of solving the problem of structural changes without modifying the underlying schema. Attribute-value pair in this\ncontext is user-defined. Contrary to what exists in most of the existing annotation systems, our approach allows a user to define his own attribute to depict the"

      "text" : "sense of his annotation and associate a value to the defined attribute. We assume that this approach will allow user to contextualize documents or document-\nobjects of interest and will provide a good basis for data restructuring, data mining, robust exploitation and knowledge elicitation, among others.\nIn our approach to represent annotation, we identify five functional requirements that must be considered in designing an annotation system:\n- Structure: the structure of an annotation is as important as the content of the annotation. As earlier explained, allowing a user to express his observation and/or contextualize document object of interest as attribute-value pair annotation could improve significantly the effectiveness of such valued-added\ninformation as opposed to adding annotation as atomic object only. Users should have the possibilities of expressing their views without restriction.\nThey should be able to choose the word, phrase or sentence that best suit what they intend to represent.\n- Communication: users may share their perceptions of the decision problem or of any information through annotation in a collaborative environment. The conclusion arrived at about the object of deliberation (decision problem) could be added to the initial information source as annotation. The use of\nannotation as a platform for economic actors to share one another’s perception could be done synchronously or asynchronously. With synchronous\nannotation, users can communicate with one another in real time. It however, requires all participating actors to be online. With asynchronous\nannotation, the actors need not communicate in real time. However, a means of notifying the concerned actors about the pending messages is\nnecessary.\n- Anchor: annotation created can be anchored to the underlying document as inline annotation or as overlay depending on whether the user has access right to modify the document or not. Considering the wealth of information that resides in different sources of information, annotation tool that does\nnot take into consideration the structure of documents will prove more valuable.\n- Scalability: there should be the possibility of growth on annotation made. Annotations could become document for further annotations. - Reusability: previous annotations made should be reusable. Users should be able to adapt previous annotations to similar problem without necessarily\nmodifying it. A modified annotation becomes another annotation.\n- Granularity: users should be able to add annotation to document or document object of interest at any level of granularity. No restriction should be place on what to annotate and where to place such annotation. There should be the possibility of adding annotations both at coarse-grain level and fine-grain\nlevel. For example, annotation might be added to document title, paragraph, sentence, phrase, text, word, image section etc.\nFigure 2 below shows the logical view of annotation-as-process taking into consideration the complexity of annotation discussed above. The document to\nbe annotated is fetched from document database. For a user to create annotation, he needs to log in if his profile is already stored in the user database or\nregister as a new user. Then he can create annotation or make a follow up annotation on the document or its content. The annotation created, the anchoring\ninformation and the information on the user are stored in the annotation database. Information stored in both annotation database and user database is a form\nof knowledge base. Knowledge on annotation pattern of an individual actor or annotations made concerning a decision problem can be extracted. We have\nseparated annotating the entire document from annotating parts of a document to make searching more effective. Anchoring an annotation to an entire\ndocument involves linking the annotation to the Uniform Resource Identifier of the document."

Thus, we propose the approach of “Dynamic Capitalization” (DC) in the context of EI. We\nrefer to the knowledge on actors, their tasks, and the results of their activities in resolution of decision problem as knowledge resources (KR). DC is an\napproach in which acquisition of KR covers the communication among actors in the course of resolving a decision problem. The process of validation of KR\nfor reaching concession among actors is also captured with annotation process. Thus, this approach serves as the suitable methodology for KC effort in which\nflexible capitalization of reliable and updated knowledge is required. We present subsequently DC approach.\n3.1 Dynamic Capitalization of Knowledge Resources DC cycle [13] is depicted by figure 3. There are five major phases in this approach and each phase is dynamic with respect to evaluation and validation of\nKR by actors. Each phase is discussed in turn."

We proposed the process of\ndeclaration and annotation for this dynamic acquisition of KR. The declaration process allows actors to declare KR with respect to their roles and context at\nhand. For example, a decision maker expresses a decision problem which can be externalized in form of a document. The annotation process is used to\ncapture the recurrent communication among actors. This supports the necessity of proper understanding and validation of knowledge among them. The\nexternalized knowledge undergoes validation to ensure that there is high degree of reliability of KR as conceded by actors.

It includes the new problem and the assessment of the\nactor on the relevance of kr being exploited. Thus, it is possible to evaluate such KC system. Also, the strategy causes the Knowledge Repository to keep\nevolving as long as there is exploitation by actors. The method for realizing this is collaborative filtering. Thus, DC approach facilitates actors to share the\nlessons gained during knowledge exploitation by capturing and storing generated feedback as well as the exploited kr. This is described in figure 6.\nFigure 6: Dynamic exploitation process\nThus, the system becomes dynamic as a result of continuous update from knowledge reuse and capitalization of lesson by actors.\n4. Managing interactions among collaborating actor When various actors work together in a collaborative environment, there is need to coordinate their interactions. Managing interactions among\ncollaborating EI actors is an essential element towards effective knowledge production and sharing. Our approach to managing these interactions is by\nenabling group awareness among the actors. When two or more persons work together on a problem; each generates a multitude of signals, either explicit or\nimplicit. The possibility of receiving signals from each other in a group (traditional or virtual) provides an understanding of the actions and intentions of the\ngroup. In the field of Computer supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), awareness is the term used to denote the knowledge that results from the perception of\nsignals emitted by group members [8]. Group awareness can unite stakeholders on resolving a given problem."

      "text" : "Awareness as defined by Dourich “is an understanding of the activities of others, which provides a context for your own activity. This context is used to\nensure that individual contributions are relevant to the group’s activity as a whole and to evaluate individual actions with respect to group goals and\nprogress.” [6] Group awareness is achieved by capturing each actor’s activities and the signals emanating from him/her in order to communicate them with\nhis/her collaborators.\nOur approach for managing the interactions among collaborating EI actors is by implementing three levels of group awareness:\n- Workspace awareness: allows EI actors to have knowledge about the state of the shared workspace and its evolution. Workspace awareness can be achieved through a synchronous collaborative whiteboard or a shared editor. In an asynchronous collaboration situation, it can be achieved by\nfacilitating workspace persistence. In the prototype we developed, we combined two approaches: shared interface and workspace persistence.\n- Presence awareness: allows to know the actors that are online at any given time and their availability. - Activity awareness: handles the communication of all activities been carried out by the different actors in the collaborative environment. It allows the\nactors to be aware of one another’s activities in real time.\n5. Application scenario The propositions made in this paper have been implemented in two different systems. The first system called EIKC (Economic Intelligence Knowledge\nCapitalization) system allows for knowledge sharing and capitalization during decision problem identification and definition process. It also caters for the\ntranslation of the decision problem into information problem. This system allows EI actors to realize these tasks in a collaborative manner and it automatically\ncaptures the expressed knowledge for capitalization purpose.\nEIKC system is simulated with a scenario of DP project stated below:\nThe recent 2010/2011NECO GCE results released by National Examinations Council of Nigeria (NECO) show that 98% of candidates failed the\nexamination 1 . This poses a major challenge to all stakeholders.\nThis scenario can be considered as a decision problem. Figures 7-10 show how knowledge is elicited and capitalized among the participating EI actors in\nsolving this problem. Decision maker presents the decision problem as initial demand and its contexts – internal and external environment using the interface\nshown in figure 7. This formulated initial demand is viewed by other participating actors as shown in figure 8. Subsequently, the watcher defines the stake of\nthe DP using the annotation interface as illustrated in figure 9. Decision maker used annotation interface for the validation of the specified stake while the\ntimestamp is also stored (figure 10). The watcher reacts to decision maker’s annotation and update DP stake accordingly. This process is repeated until\nconcession is reached. The knowledge of the subsequent tasks of the resolution process is capitalized with respective links on the EIKC system interface.\nActors exploit the KM system by visualizing both validated and pre-validated or evolving knowledge of specific tasks of resolving DP according to EI\nprocess.\n1 http://www.informationnigeria.org/2010/03/neco-gce-results-released-98-of-candidates-fail-as-neco-releases-novdec.html (retrieved on 30/09/2010)."

This paper discussed knowledge capitalisation\napproach in economic intelligence. We noted that EI actors collaborate in solving decision problem. During collaboration, there is need for each actor to\nexpress his knowledge in a form that can be shared and understood by other actors. We proposed an annotation model that allows for knowledge elicitation as\nattribute-value pair in EI. Expressed knowledge are capitalised using our dynamic capitalisation method. The need to manage interactions among collaborating\nactors led to the proposition of three level of group awareness. Our propositions were implemented in EIKC and MECOCIR system.\n7. Reference [1].

    "abstractText" : "The shift from industrial economy to knowledge economy in today’s world has revolutionalized strategic planning in organizations as well as their problem solving approaches. The point of focus today is knowledge and service production with more emphasis been laid on knowledge capital. Many organizations are investing on tools that facilitate knowledge sharing among their employees and they are as well promoting and encouraging collaboration among their staff in order to build the organization’s knowledge capital with the ultimate goal of creating a lasting competitive advantage for their organizations. One of the current leading approaches used for solving organization’s decision problem is the Economic Intelligence (EI) approach which involves interactions among various actors called EI actors. These actors collaborate to ensure the overall success of the decision problem solving process. In the course of the collaboration, the actors express knowledge which could be capitalized for future reuse. In this paper, we propose in the first place, an annotation model for knowledge elicitation among EI actors. Because of the need to build a knowledge capital, we also propose a dynamic knowledge capitalisation approach for managing knowledge produced by the actors. Finally, the need to manage the interactions and the interdependencies among collaborating EI actors, led to our third proposition which constitute an awareness mechanism for group work management.",
