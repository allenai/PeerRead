      "text" : "Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) [Sutton & Barto, 1998] algorithms have worked with relatively simple environments (such as grid worlds) wherein policy estimates can be constructed using tabular methods or simple linear parameterizations. The state representation in such problems often consists of hand-crafted features. Recent advances in Deep Learning (DL) [Bengio et al., 2009; LeCun et al., 2015] have enabled RL methods to scale to problems with exponentially larger state spaces and even continuous action domains. This combination of RL based cost functions and DL based compositional and hierarchical representations for the state, policies and value functions has resulted in the field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). Such DRL methods [Guo et al., 2014; Mnih et al., 2015; Schulman et al., 2015; Lillicrap et al., 2015; Schaul et al., 2015; Mnih et al., 2016b; Van Hasselt et al., 2016; Mnih et al., 2016a; Bacon et al., 2017; Jaderberg et al., 2017] perform impressively in many challenging high-dimensional sequential decision making problem such as Atari 2600 [Bellemare et al., 2013], MuJoCo [Todorov et al., 2012], TORCS Wymann et al. [2000] and the board game of Go [Silver et al., 2016].\n* These authors contributed equally\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n07 26\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\nMany such DRL algorithms operate on discrete action space domains such as Atari 2600. The total number of actions in this domain is eighteen. These eighteen actions have been visualized in Figure 1. Observe that these eighteen actions, although presented to the DRL algorithms as the smallest indivisible units of action, are in fact not indivisible at all. There exists an inherent underlying compositional structure in this action space which a DRL algorithm can potentially take advantage of, while training. Consider a DRL agent that executes the action go diagonally up and left and gets some reward corresponding to this action. The key insight in this work is that this feedback can be used to learn not only about the go diagonally up and left action but also the actions go up and go left. Hence, every time a diagonal step is executed, it is possible to learn about the individual action factors as well. In the Atari domain, the action space can be decomposed along three independent dimensions: vertical motion ({go up, go down, don’t move vertically}), horizontal motion ({go left, go right, don’t move horizontally}) and firing ({fire, don’t fire}). This work explicitly factors policies and action-value functions along these dimensions by building the factoring into the DRL agent’s network architecture. The notion of factoring is not new to the DRL setup. Sharma et al. [2017] have demonstrated remarkable improvements in a variety of domains using a framework that factors the policy into one for choosing actions and another for choosing repetitions.\nThe key motivations for our work are principles underlying biological systems, that have shown to learn representations in an independent and orthogonal manner [Baumann et al., 2011; Bell & Sejnowski, 1997]. At an abstract level, our work is also similar to intra-option learning [Sutton et al., 1998] frameworks, which revolves around the idea of learning about an option while executing another. Arguably, humans also make decisions in a similar manner, with the fundamental unit of decisions being the orthogonal directions along which the decision space can be decomposed. While our factoring scheme can be used to extend any DRL algorithm which operates with compositional discrete action spaces, in this paper we extend the Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) and the Asynchronous n-step Q-Learning [Mnih et al., 2016b] algorithms. We demonstrate empirically that our proposed paradigm , Factored Action space Representations (FAR), provides considerable improvements over the A3C and AQL algorithms. We also provide an analysis of the factored policy learned using FARA3C that demonstrates its robustness compared to A3C policies."

Most Actor Critic algorithms use parametric representations for the actor (π(s; θ)) and the critic V (s;w). A biased sample-estimate for the policy gradient is given by( ∇θlog(π(at|st; θt) ) Q(st, at). To lower variance in the updates, a baseline term is introduced and\nthe sample-estimate of policy gradient becomes ( ∇θt log(π(at|st; θt) ) ( Q(st, at)− V (st) ) .

      "text" : "Extending the Advantage Actor-Critic algorithms naively in the DRL setup fails to work because the stochastic gradient descent algorithms commonly used with such DRL setups assume that the input samples are independent and are identically distributed. An on-policy Actor-Critic algorithm parametrized by neural networks has highly correlated inputs and therefore performs poorly when gradient based methods are used. Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) methods [Mnih et al., 2016b] overcome this problem by using asynchronous parallel actor-learners which simultaneously explore different parts of state space. Each learner maintains its own set of parameters which are routinely synchronized with the other learners. Using parallel actor learners ensures that their exploration of different parts of the state space translates into updates for the neural network that are relatively uncorrelated."

      "text" : "The Factored Action Representations (FAR) framework can extend any DRL algorithm that operates on problems with compositional discrete action spaces. This includes algorithms which model Q-functions (like DQN [Mnih et al., 2015] or asynchronous n-step Q-learning [Mnih et al., 2016b]) and actor-critic algorithms (like A3C [Mnih et al., 2016b]). In the actor critic methods, FAR extends only the policy modeled by the actor; the critic is not modified. In the deep Q-learning methods, FAR modifies the representation for the action-value function that the DRL algorithm models. Let X represent either the policy of an actor-critic DRL algorithm or the Q-function of a deep Q-learning algorithm. FAR represents X (Xi corresponds to the action ai) using a factored representation. Each of the factors represents a different dimension of the composite action space. We explain FAR with the Atari domain action space as an example. Figure 2 visualizes a factoring of X over the complete Atari action space. Any action in the complete Atari action space can be represented as a tuple (hi, vi, fi) with vi ∈ {go up, go down, don’t move vertically}, hi ∈ {go left, go right, don’t move horizontally} and fi ∈ {fire, don’t fire}. The choice of the factors over which X is decomposed depends on the set of possible actions, for a given task. This decomposed representation of X allows the DRL agent to learn X corresponding to multiple actions simultaneously, while executing a single action. When the action a = up-right-fire is executed, the parameters corresponding to the individual factors of Xa: up, right and fire get updated. Hence Xup-fire, Xright-fire and Xup-left are also adjusted, and not just the Xa.\nLet S denote set of all states in an MDP and A denote the discrete action set for a DRL agent. We claim that often, action spaces A are compositional and thus allow the decomposition of any action a ∈ A into n independent action-factors [a1, a2, · · · , an] such that ai ∈ Ai, where Ai is the set of values that factor i can take. We claim that instead of modeling X over A, the agent would be better off, modeling the individual components of X over the factor-spaces Ai. These individual components of X are realized using independent output layers (referred to as factor-layers hereafter) of a neural network f1, f2,..., fn where fi corresponds to Ai and has size |Ai|. X can be written in terms of the factor-layer outputs as: X(s, a) =M(f1(a1|s), f2(a2|s), ..., fn(an|s)) where s ∈ S . In this equation, the combination function M can have any suitable parameterized or non-parametrized form. If X is a policy, then ∑ a∈AX(a|s) = 1 must be enforced. Detailed training algorithms for training FAR variants proposed in this paper can be found in Appendix B."

The first factor encodes horizontal movement (ah = left/right/no horizontal movement). The second factor encodes vertical movement (av = up/down/no vertical movement). The third factor encodes whether to fire or not (af = fire/don’t fire). A visualization of this action space decomposition for the Atari domain is shown in Figure 2. This composite action space can be visualized as a 3-dimensional cuboid of dimensions 3× 3× 2 where each 1× 1× 1 cell represents a composite action.

The combination functions M that we experimented with were of the form softmax(m(f1(a1|s), f2(a2|s), ..., fn(an|s))), where m ∈ {Summation,Multiplication,Arithmetic Mean,Harmonic Mean,Geometric Mean,Minimum}. Note that the Arithmetic Mean and the Summation functions are identical barring a scaling factor of n (number of action factors). This subtle difference could however lead to different policies being learned.\nWe observed that choosing m = Summation resulted in the highest performance for FARA3C as indicated by Figure 4. We decided to stick to a similar functional form for M for the AQL case as well, to demonstrate the robustness of our choice of the combination function.

This is because using a factored policy representation enables the FARA3C agents to learn about multiple actions while executing one. As a result, one would expect FARA3C to have a better ordering of actions in the policy than A3C. In order to validate this hypothesis empirically, we conducted experiments comparing the robustness of the A3C and FARA3C policies.\n5.1 Uniformly Random from best-K analysis\nThe experiment is as follows: A trained agent is taken. With probability 1 − , the agent samples actions from the learned policy. With probability , it samples actions uniformly at random from the best k actions. The use of introduces noise in the learned policy and the agents with the more robust policies would demonstrate a lower drop in performance, as increases. The value for was varied from 0 to 0.5 in steps of 0.05 and the corresponding normalized performances were plotted. The individual curves have been normalized using the maximum score to ensure a fair comparison between the FARA3C and the A3C agents by comparing only the relative changes.

Increasing Z results in the injection of more noise into the policy. Hence a more robust policy is expected to have a smaller drop in performance on increasing Z. The hyper-parameter Z was varied from 1.0 to 3.0 in steps of 0.25 and the performance was plotted after normalizing it against the maximum score obtained by the agent. From Figure 9 it is clear that for most tasks, FARA3C agents are more robust to noise injection."

FAR factors a policy/value function into independent components and models those using independent output layers of a neural network. The FAR framework allows DRL agents to exploit the underlying compositional structure in discrete action spaces found in common RL domains to learn better policies and action-value functions. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of FAR to the baseline methods considered. A possible extension of this framework would be to combine action-space factoring with the concept of action repetition as discussed by Sharma et al. [2017]. Action repetition could act as yet another factor of the action space and this extension could allow one to capture a large set of macro actions."

[2016b]] was used for updating parameters with the same hyper-parameters as in Mnih et al. [2016b]. The initial learning rate used was 10−3 and it was linearly annealed to 0 over 100 million steps. The n used in n-step returns was 20. Entropy regularization was used to encourage exploration, similar to Mnih et al. [2016b]. The β for entropy regularization was found to be 0.01 after hyper-parameter tuning, both for FARA3C and A3C. The β was tuned in the set {0.01, 0.02}. The optimal learning rate was found to be 7× 10−4 for both FARA3C and A3C separately. The learning rate was tuned over the set {7× 10−4, 10−3}. The discounting factor for rewards was retained at 0.99 since it seems to work well for a large number of methods [Mnih et al., 2016b; Sharma et al., 2017; Jaderberg et al., 2017].\nAll the models were trained for 100 million time steps. Evaluation was done after every 1 million steps of training and followed the strategy described in Sharma et al. [2017]. This evaluation was done for 100 episodes, with each episode’s length capped at 20000 steps, to arrive at an average score. The evolution of this average game-play performance with training progress has been demonstrated for a few games in Figure 6. An expanded version of the figure for all the games can be found in Appendix D. Table 1 in Appendix C contains the raw scores obtained by FARA3C and A3C agents on 15 Atari 2600 games. The evaluation was done using the best agent obtained after training for 100 million steps (where the best agent was chosen according to the model selection paradigm outlines in citedqn).\nArchitecture details\nWe used a low level architecture similar to Mnih et al. [2016b]; Sharma et al. [2017] which in turn uses the same low level architecture as Mnih et al. [2015]. Figure 3 contains a visual depiction of the network used for FARA3C. The same architecture was used for FARA3C and A3C agents and has been described below: The first three layers are convolutional layers with same filter sizes, strides, padding and number of filters as Mnih et al. [2015, 2016b]; Sharma et al. [2017]. These convolutional layers are followed by two fully connected (FC) layers and an LSTM layer. A policy and a value function are derived from the LSTM outputs using two different output heads. The number of neurons in each of the FC layers and the LSTM layers is 256.\nSimilar to Mnih et al. [2016b] the Actor and Critic networks share all but the final output layer. Each of the two functions: policy and value function are realized with a different final output layer, with the value function outputs having no non-linearity and with the policy and having a softmax-non linearity as output non-linearity, to model the multinomial distribution.\nFARAQL and AQL\nWe used a highly tuned open-source implementation of asynchronous Q-learning found at: https://github.com/Kaixhin/Atari.\nAQL\nThe learning rate was set to be 7× 10−4. The value of n for n-step returns was set to be 5. In keeping with the -greedy strategy highlighted for training asynchronous n-step Q-learning in Mnih et al. [2016b] we randomly sampled in each thread and the was decayed to various different values from the set {0.05, 0.1, 0.5}. The training period lasted 80 million time steps. The starting value of epsilon was 1 and it was linearly decayed over 64 million steps to its final value. The same network architecture as Mnih et al. [2013] was used for all the experiments.\nFARAQL\nTo better understand the generalization capabilities of our FAR framework in general and FARQL algorithm in particular, we decided to use the exact same hyper-parameter choices as AQL for FARAQL. None of the hyper-parameters for FARAQL were tuned specifically for this algorithm. This represents a hyper-parameter setting which is not very favorable to FARAQL. Even in this setting, we observe that FARAQL significantly outperforms AQL. Tuning the hyper-parameters specifically for FARAQL could result in a further improvement in performance."

Among all such visual decision making problems, those with discrete action spaces often tend to have underlying compositional structure in the said action space. Such action spaces often contain actions such as go left, go up as well as go diagonally up and left (which is a composition of the former two actions). The representations of control policies in such domains have traditionally been modeled without exploiting this inherent compositional structure in the action spaces. We propose a new learning paradigm, Factored Action space Representations (FAR) wherein we decompose a control policy learned using a Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm into independent components, analogous to decomposing a vector in terms of some orthogonal basis vectors. This architectural modification of the control policy representation allows the agent to learn about multiple actions simultaneously, while executing only one of them. We demonstrate that FAR yields considerable improvements on top of two DRL algorithms in Atari 2600: FARA3C outperforms A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic) in 9 out of 14 tasks and FARAQL outperforms AQL (Asynchronous n-step Q-Learning) in 9 out of 13 tasks.",
