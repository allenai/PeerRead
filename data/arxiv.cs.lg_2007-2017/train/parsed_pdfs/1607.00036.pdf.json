      "text" : "Designing general-purpose learning algorithms is one of the long-standing goals of artificial intelligence. Despite the success of deep learning in this area (see, e.g., [1],) there are still a set of complex tasks that are not well addressed by conventional neural networks. Those tasks often require a neural network to be equipped with an explicit, external memory in which a larger, potentially unbounded, set of facts need to be stored. They include, but are not limited to, episodic question-answering [2, 3, 4], compact algorithms [5] and video caption generation [6].\nRecently two promising approaches based on neural networks to this type of tasks have been proposed. Memory networks [2] explicitly store all the facts, or information, available for each episode in an external memory (as continuous vectors) and use the attentional mechanism to index them when returning an output. On the other hand, neural Turing machines (NTM, [7]) read each fact in an episode and decides whether to read, write the fact or do both to the external, differentiable memory.\nA crucial difference between these two models is that the memory network does not have a mechanism to modify the content of the external memory, while the NTM does. In practice, this leads to easier learning in the memory network, which in turn resulted in it being used more in real tasks [8, 9]. On the contrary, the NTM has mainly been tested on a series of small-scale, carefully-crafted tasks such as copy and associative recall. The NTM, however is more expressive, precisely because it can store and modify the internal state of the network as it processes an episode.\nThe original NTM supports two modes of addressing (which can be used simultaneously.) They are contentbased and location-based addressing. We notice that the location-based strategy is based on linear addressing. The distance between each pair of consecutive memory cells is fixed to a constant. We address this limitation, in this paper, by introducing a learnable address vector for each memory cell of the NTM with least recently used memory addressing mechanism, and we call this variant a dynamic neural Turing machine (D-NTM).\nWe evaluate the proposed D-NTM on the full set of Facebook bAbI task [2] using either soft, differentiable attention or hard, non-differentiable attention [10] as an addressing strategy. Our experiments reveal that\nar X\niv :1\n60 7.\n00 03\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 3\n0 Ju\nn 20\nit is possible to use the hard, non-differentiable attention mechanism, and in fact, the D-NTM with the hard attention and GRU controller outperforms the one with the soft attention.\nOur Contributions\n1. We propose a generalization of Neural Turing Machine called a dynamic neural Turing machine (D-NTM) which employs learnable, location-based addressing.\n2. We demonstrate the application of neural Turing machines for a more complicated real task: episodic question-answering.\n3. We propose to use the hard attention mechanism and empirically show that it outperforms the soft attention based addressing.\n4. We propose a curriculum strategy for our model with the feedforward controller and discrete attention that improves our results significantly."

We rescale the accumulated vt with γt, such that the controller adjusts the influence of how much the previously written memory locations should effect the attention weights of a particular time-step. Next, we subtract vt from zt in order to reduce the weights of previously read or written memory locations. γt is a shallow MLP with a scalar output and it is conditioned on the hidden state of the controller. γt is parametrized with the parameters uγ and bγ,\nγt = sigmoid(uγht + bγ), (8) wt ← softmax(zt − γtvt−1).

      "heading" : "4 Regularizing Dynamic Neural Turing Machines",

We found that this pathological case can be effectively avoided by encouraging the read head to point to a memory cell which has also been pointed by the write head. This can be implemented as the following regularization term:\nRrw(w,u) = λ T∑ t′=1 ||1− ( 1 t′ t′∑ t=1 ut) >wt′||22\nIn the equations above, ut is the write and wt is the read weights.\nNext Input Prediction as Regularization Temporal structure is a strong signal that should be exploited by the controller based on a recurrent neural network. We exploit this structure by letting the controller predict the input in the future. We maximize the predictability of the next input by the controller during training. This is equivalent to minimizing the following regularizer:\nRpred(W) = − log p(fBOWt+1 |ft,wt,ut,Mt;W)).\nWe found this regularizer to be effective in our preliminary experiments and use it throughout the experiments."

      "heading" : "5 Generating Discrete Address Vectors",
      "text" : "In this section, we briefly describe the hard attention based addressing strategy.\nDiscrete Addressing Let us use w to denote an address vector (either read, write or erase) at time t. By definition in Eq. (6), every element in this address vector is positive and sums up to one. In other words, we can treat this vector as the probabilities of a categorical distribution C(w) with dim(w) choices:\np(j) = wj,\nwhere wj is the j-th element of w. We can readily sample from this categorical distribution and form an one-hot vector w̃ such that\nw̃k = I(k = j),\nwhere j ∼ C(w), and I is an indicator function.\nTraining We use this sampling-based strategy for all the heads during training. This clearly makes the use of backpropagation infeasible to compute the gradient, as the sampling procedure is not differentiable. Thus, we use REINFORCE [15] together with the three variance reduction techniques–global baseline, input-dependent baseline and variance normalization– suggested in [16].\nLet us defineR(x) = log p(y|x1, . . . ,xT ) as a reward. We first center and re-scale the reward by\nR̃(x) = R(x)− b√ σ2 + ,\nwhere b and σ is running average and standard deviation ofR(x). We can further center it for each input x separately, i.e.,\nR̃(x)← R̃(x)− b(x), where b(x) is computed by a baseline network which takes as input x and predicts its estimated reward. The baseline network is trained to minimize the Huber loss [17] between the true reward R̃(x)∗ and the predicted reward b(x). We use the Huber loss, which is defined by\nHδ(x) = { x2 for |x| ≤ δ, δ(2|x| − δ), otherwise,\ndue to its robustness. As a further measure to reduce the variance, we regularize the negative entropy of all those category distributions to facilitate a better exploration during training [18].\nThen, the cost function for each training example is approximated as\nCn(θ) =− log p(y|x1:T , w̃1:J , ũ1:J , ẽ1:J)\n− J∑ j=1 R̃(xn)(log p(w̃j|x1:T ) + log p(ũj|x1:T ) + log p(ẽj|x1:T ))\n+ λH J∑ j=1 (H(wj|x1:T ) +H(uj|x1:T ) +H(ej|x1:T )),\nwhere J is the number of addressing steps, λH is the entropy regularization coefficient, andH denotes the entropy.\nInference Once training is over, we switch to a deterministic strategy. We simply choose an element of w with the largest value to be the index of the target memory cell, such that\nw̃k = I(k = argmax(w)).\nCurriculum Learning for the Discrete Attention Training discrete attention with feed-forward controller and REINFORCE is challenging. We propose to use a curriculum strategy for training with the discrete attention in order to tackle this problem. For each minibatch, we sample π from a binomial distribution with the probability pt, πt ∼ Bin(pt). The model will either use the discrete or the soft-attention based on the πt. We start the training procedure with p0 = 1 and during the training pt is annealed to 0 by setting pt = p 0\n√ 1+t .\nWe can rewrite the weights wt as in Equation 5, where it is expressed as the combination of soft attention weights w̄t and discrete attention weights w̃t withπt being a binary variable that chooses to use one of them,\nwt ← πtw̄t + (1− πt)w̃t .\nBy using this curriculum learning strategy, at the beginning of the training, the model learns to use the memory mainly with the soft attention. As we anneal the pt, the model will rely more on the discrete attention."

      "text" : "A recurrent neural network (RNN), which is used as a controller in the proposed D-NTM, has an implicit memory in the form of recurring hidden states. Even with this implicit memory, a vanilla RNN is however known to have difficulties in storing information for long time-spans [19]. Long short-term memory (LSTM, [20]) and gated recurrent units (GRU, [11]) have been found to address this issue. However all these models based solely on RNNs have been found to be limited when they are used to solve, e.g., algorithmic tasks and episodic question-answering.\nIn addition to the finite random access memory of the neural Turing machine, based on which the D-NTM is designed, other data structures have been proposed as external memory for neural networks. In [21, 22, 12], a continuous, differentiable stack was proposed. In [5, 10], grid and tape storages are used. These approaches differ from the NTM in that their memory is unbounded and can grow indefinitely. On the other hand, they are often not randomly accessible.\nMemory networks [2] form another family of neural networks with external memory. In this class of neural networks, information is stored explicitly as it is (in the form of its continuous representation) in the memory, without being erased or modified during an episode. Memory networks and their variants have been applied to various tasks successfully [13, 8, 9, 23].\nAnother related family of models is the attention-based neural networks. Neural networks with soft or hard attention over an input have shown promising results on a variety of challenging tasks, including machine translation [24, 25], speech recognition [26], machine reading comprehension [3] and image caption generation [18].\nThe latter two, the memory network and attention-based networks, are however clearly distinguishable from the D-NTM by the fact that they do not modify the content of the memory."

First, we present for the first time the performance of a memory-based network that can both read and write dynamically on the Facebook bAbI tasks. We aim to understand whether a model that has to learn to write an incoming fact to the memory, rather than storing it as it is, is able to work well, and to do so, we compare both the original NTM and proposed D-NTM against an LSTM-RNN.\nSecond, we investigate the effect of having to learn how to write. The fact that the NTM needs to learn to write likely has adverse effect on the overall performance, when compared to, for instance, end-to-end memory networks (MemN2N, [13]) and dynamic memory network (DMN+, [23]) both of which simply store the incoming facts as they are. We quantify this effect in this experiment. Lastly, we show the effect of the proposed learnable addressing scheme.\nWe further explore the effect of using a feedforward controller instead of the GRU controller. In addition to the explicit memory, the GRU controller can use its own internal hidden state as the memory. On the other hand, the feedforward controller must solely rely on the explicit memory, as it is the only memory available."

      "heading" : "7.3 Results and Analysis",
      "text" : "In Table 1, we first observe that the NTMs are indeed capable of solving this type of episodic question-answering better than the vanilla LSTM-RNN. Although the availability of explicit memory in the NTM has already suggested this result, we note that this is the first time neural Turing machines have been used in this specific task.\nAll the variants of NTM with the GRU controller outperform the vanilla LSTM-RNN. However, not all them perform equally well. First, it is clear that the proposed dynamic NTM (D-NTM) using the GRU controller outperforms the original NTM with the GRU controller (LBA NTM, CBA NTM vs. Soft D-NTM, Hard D-NTM). As discussed earlier, the learnable addressing scheme of the D-NTM allows the controller to access the memory slots by location in a potentially nonlinear way. We expect it to help with tasks that have non-trivial access patterns, and as anticipated, we see a large gain with the D-NTM over the original NTM in the tasks of, for instance, 12 - Conjunction and 17 - Positional Reasoning.\nAmong the recurrent variants of the proposed D-NTM, we notice significant improvements by using discrete addressing over using soft addressing. We conjecture that this is due to certain types of tasks that require precise/sharp retrieval of a stored fact, in which case soft addressing is in disadvantage over discrete addressing. This is evident from the observation that the D-NTM with discrete addressing significantly outperforms that with soft addressing in the tasks of 8 - Lists/Sets and 11 - Basic Coreference. Furthermore, this is in line with an earlier observation in [18], where discrete addressing was found to generalize better in the task of image caption generation.\nIn Table 2, we observe that the D-NTM with the feedforward controller and discrete attention performs worse than LSTM and D-NTM with soft-attention. However, when the proposed curriculum strategy from Sec. 5 is used, the average test error drops from 68.30 to 37.79.\nWe empirically found training of the feedforward controller more difficult than that of the recurrent controller. We train our feedforward controller based models four times longer (in terms of the number of updates) than the recurrent controller based ones in order to ensure that they are converged for most of the tasks. On the other hand, the models trained with the GRU controller overfit on bAbI tasks very quickly. For example, on tasks 3 and 16 the feedforward controller based model underfits (i.e., high training loss) at the end of the training, whereas with the same number of units the model with the GRU controller can overfit on those tasks after 3,000 updates only.\nWhen our results are compared to the variants of the memory network [2] (MemN2N and DMN+), we notice a significant performance gap. We attribute this gap to the difficulty in learning to manipulate and store a complex input."

      "text" : "In this paper we extend neural Turing machines (NTM) by introducing a learnable addressing scheme which allows the NTM to be capable of performing highly nonlinear location-based addressing. This extension, to which we refer by dynamic NTM (D-NTM), is extensively tested with various configurations, including different addressing mechanisms (soft vs. discrete) and different number of addressing steps, on the Facebook bAbI tasks. This is the first time an NTM-type model was tested on this task, and we observe that the NTM, especially the proposed D-NTM, performs better than vanilla LSTM-RNN. Furthermore, the experiments revealed that the discrete, hard addressing works better than the soft addressing with the GRU controller, and our analysis reveals that this is the case when the task requires precise retrieval of memory content.\nOur experiments showed that the NTM-based models are weaker than other variants of memory networks which do not learn but have an explicit mechanism of storing incoming facts as they are. We conjecture that this is due to the difficulty in learning how to write, manipulate and delete the content of memory. Despite this difficulty, we find the NTM-based approach, such as the proposed D-NTM, to be a better, future-proof approach, because it can scale to a much longer horizon (where it becomes impossible to explicitly store all the experiences.)\nThe success of both the learnable address and the discrete addressing scheme suggests two future research directions. First, we should try both of these schemes in a wider array of memory-based models, as they are not specific to the neural Turing machines. Second, the proposed D-NTM needs to be evaluated on a diverse set of applications, such as text summarization [30], visual question-answering [31] and machine translation, in order to make an even more concrete conclusion."

We implement the D-NTM with both soft, differentiable and hard, non-differentiable read/write mechanisms. We investigate the mechanisms and effects for learning to read and write to a memory through experiments on Facebook bAbI tasks using both a feedforward and GRU-controller. The D-NTM is evaluated on a set of the Facebook bAbI tasks and shown to outperform NTM and LSTM baselines.",
