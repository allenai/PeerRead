The resulting algorithms, however, require time exponential in the clique size, i.e., the treewidth of the original graph. The treewidth of many graphs of practical interest is prohibitively large — for instance, it grows as O(n) for an n × n square lattice. A large number of approximate inference techniques have been developed so as to deal with such graphs, such as pseudolikelihood (Besag, 1986), mean field approximation, loopy belief propagation (Weiss, 2001;\nar X\niv :0\n81 0.\n44 01\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n2 4\nO ct\nYedidia et al., 2003), tree reweighting (Wainwright et al., 2003, 2005), and tree sampling (Hamze and de Freitas, 2004)."

      "text" : "Efficient exact inference is possible in certain graphical models with binary node labels. Here we focus on Ising models, whose energy functions have the form E : {0, 1}n → R with\nE(y) := ∑\n(i,j)∈E\n[yi 6= yj ]Eij , (2)\nwhere [·] denotes the indicator function, i.e., the cost Eij is incurred only in those states y where yi and yj disagree. Compared to the general model (1) for binary nodes, (2) imposes two additional restrictions: zero node energies, and edge energies in the form of disagreement costs. At first glance these constraints look severe; for instance, such systems must obey the symmetry E(y) = E(¬y), where ¬ denotes Boolean negation (ones’ complement). It is well known, however, that adding a single node makes the Ising model (2) as expressive as the general model (1) for binary variables:\nTheorem 1 Every energy function of the form (1) over n binary variables is equivalent to an Ising energy function of the form (2) over n + 1 variables, with the additional variable held constant.\nProof by construction: Two energy functions are equivalent if they differ only by a constant. Without loss of generality, denote the additional variable y0 and hold it constant at y0 := 0. Given an energy function of the form (1), construct an Ising model with disagreement costs as follows:\n1. For each node energy function E′i(yi), add a disagreement cost of E0i := E ′ i(1)−E′i(0),\nas shown in Figure 1a. Note that in both states of yi, the energy of the resulting Ising model is shifted relative to E′i(yi) by the same constant amount, namely E ′ i(0):\nyi general Ising energy 0 E′i(0) 0 = E ′ i(0)− E′i(0) 1 E′i(1) E0i = E ′ i(1)− E′i(0)\n2. For each edge energy function E′ij(yi, yj), add the three disagreement cost terms\nEij := 12 [(E ′ ij(0, 1) + E ′ ij(1, 0))− (E′ij(0, 0) + E′ij(1, 1))], E0i := E′ij(1, 0)− E′ij(0, 0)− Eij , and (3) E0j := E′ij(0, 1)− E′ij(0, 0)− Eij ,\nas shown in Figure 1b. Note that for all states of yi and yj , the energy of the resulting Ising model is shifted relative to E′i(yi) by the same constant amount, namely E ′ ij(0, 0):\nyi yj general Ising energy 0 0 E′ij(0, 0) 0 = E ′ ij(0, 0)− E′ij(0, 0) 0 1 E′ij(0, 1) E0j + Eij = E ′ ij(0, 1)− E′ij(0, 0) 1 0 E′ij(1, 0) E0i + Eij = E ′ ij(1, 0)− E′ij(0, 0) 1 1 E′ij(1, 1) E0i + E0j = E ′ ij(1, 1)− E′ij(0, 0)\nSumming the above terms, the total bias of node i (i.e., its disagreement cost with the bias node) is\nE0i = E′i(1)− E′i(0) + ∑\nj:(i,j)∈E\n[E′ij(1, 0)− E′ij(0, 0)− Eij ] . (4)\nThis construction defines an Ising model whose energy in every configuration y is shifted, relative to that of the general model we started with, by the same constant amount, namely E′(0):\n∀y ∈ {0, 1}n : E ([\n0 y\n]) = E′(y) − ∑ i∈V E′i(0) − ∑ (i,j)∈E E′ij(0, 0)\n= E′(y)− E′(0). (5)\nThe two models’ energy functions are therefore equivalent.\nNote how in the above construction the label symmetry E(y) = E(¬y) of the plain Ising model (2) is conveniently broken by the introduction of a bias node, through the convention that y0 := 0."

      "text" : "Definition 2 The cut C of a binary graphical model G(V, E) induced by state y ∈ {0, 1}n is the set C(y) := {(i, j) ∈ E : yi 6= yj}; its weight |C(y)| is the sum of the weights of its edges.\nAny given state y partitions the nodes of a binary graphical model into two sets: those labeled ‘0’, and those labeled ‘1’. The corresponding graph cut is the set of edges crossing the partition; since only they contribute disagreement costs to the Ising model (2), we have ∀y : |C(y)| = E(y). The lowest-energy state of an Ising model therefore induces its minimum-weight cut.\nMinimum-weight cuts can be computed in polynomial time in graphs whose edge weights are all non-negative. Introducing one more node, with the constraint yn+1 := 1, allows us to construct an equivalent energy function by replacing each negatively weighted bias edge E0i < 0 by an edge to the new node n + 1 with the positive weight Ei,n+1 := −E0i > 0 (Figure 1c). This still leaves us with the requirement that all non-bias edges be nonnegative. This submodularity constraint implies that agreement between nodes must be locally preferable to disagreement — a severe limitation.\nThe now widespread use of graph cuts in machine learning to find lowest-energy configurations, in particular in image processing, was pioneered by Greig et al. (1989). Our construction (Figure 1c) differs from that of Kolmogorov and Zabih (2004) (Figure 1d) in that we do not employ the notion of directed edges. (In directed graphs, the weight of a cut is the sum of the weights of only those edges crossing the cut in a given direction.) We note that a more elaborate construction can give partial answers in graphs with some negative edge weights (Kolmogorov and Rother, 2007; Rother et al., 2007b), and that a sequence of expansion moves (energy minimizations in binary graphs) can efficiently yield an approximate answer for graphs with discrete but non-binary node labels (Boykov et al., 2001)."

      "heading" : "2.1 Embedding Planar Graphs",
      "text" : "Definition 3 A graph is planar if it can be drawn in the plane R2 without edge intersections. The regions into which such a plane drawing partitions R2 are the faces of the drawing; the unbounded region is the external face.\nThe operational nature of this definition would suggest that our algorithms must produce (or have access to) a plane drawing of the model graph. This is unsatisfactory in that such a drawing contains much information (such as the precise location of the vertices, and the exact shape of the edges) that we will not need. All we care about is the cyclic (say, clockwise) ordering of the edges incident upon each vertex. In topological graph theory, this is formalized in the notion of a rotation system (White and Beineke, 1978, p. 21f):\nDefinition 4 Let G(V, E) be an undirected, connected graph. For each vertex i ∈ V, let Ei denote the set of edges in E incident upon i, considered as being oriented away from i, and let πi be a cyclic permutation of Ei. A rotation system for G is a set of permutations Π = {πi : i ∈ V}.\nTo define the sets Ei of oriented edges more formally, construct the directed graph G(V, E ′), where E ′ contains a pair of directed edges (known as edgelets) for each undirected edge in E , that is, (i, j) ∈ E ′ ⇐⇒ [(i, j) ∈ E ∨ (j, i) ∈ E ]. Then Ei = {(j, k) ∈ E ′ : i = j}.\nRotation systems directly correspond to topological graph embeddings in orientable surfaces:\nTheorem 5 Each rotation system determines an embedding of G in some orientable surface S such that ∀i ∈ V, any edge (i, j) ∈ Ei is followed by πi(i, j) in (say) clockwise orientation, and such that the faces F of the embedding, given by the orbits of the mapping (i, j) → πj(j, i), are 2-cells (topological disks).\nProof see White and Beineke (1978, p. 22f).\nNote that while in graph visualisation “embedding” is often used as a synonym for “drawing”, in modern topological graph theory it stands for “rotation system”. We adopt the latter usage, which views embeddings as equivalence classes of graph drawings characterized by identical cyclic ordering of the edges incident upon each vertex. For instance, π4(4, 5) = (4, 3) in Figures 2b and 2c (same embedding) but π4(4, 5) = (4, 1) in Figure 2d (different embedding). A sample face in Figures 2b–2d is given by the orbit\n(4, 1) → π1(1, 4) = (1, 2) → π2(2, 1) = (2, 4) → π4(4, 2) = (4, 1).\nThe genus g of the embedding surface S can be determined from the Euler characteristic\n|V| − |E|+ |F| = 2− 2g, (6)\nwhere |F| is found by counting the orbits of the rotation system, as described in Theorem 5. Since planar graphs are exactly those that can be embedded on a surface of genus g = 0 (a topological sphere), we arrive at a purely combinatorial definition of planarity:\nDefinition 6 A graph G(V, E) is planar iff it has a rotation system Π producing exactly 2 + |E| − |V| orbits. Such a system is called a planar embedding of G, and G(V, E ,Π) is called a plane graph.\nOur inference algorithms require a plane graph as input. In certain domains (e.g., when working with geographic information) a plane drawing of the graph (from which the corresponding embedding is readily determined) may be available. Where it is not, we employ\nthe algorithm of Boyer and Myrvold (2004) which, given any connected graph G as input, produces in linear time either a planar embedding for G or a proof that G is non-planar. Source code for this step is freely available (Boyer and Myrvold, 2004; Windsor, 2007)."

      "heading" : "2.2 The Planarity Constraint",
      "text" : "In Section 1.1 we have mapped a general binary graphical model to an Ising model with an additional bias node; now we require that that Ising model be planar. What does that imply for the original, general model? If all nodes of the graph are to be connected to the bias node without violating planarity, the graph has to be outerplanar, i.e., have a planar embedding in which all its nodes lie on the external face — a very severe restriction.\nThe situation improves, however, if we do not insist that all nodes be connected to the bias: If only a subset B ⊂ V of nodes have non-zero bias (4), then the graph only needs to be B-outerplanar, i.e., have a planar embedding in which all nodes in B lie on the same face. Model selection may thus entail the step of picking the face of a suitably embedded planar Ising model whose nodes will be connected to the bias node. In image processing, for instance, where it is common to operate on a square grid of pixels, we can permit bias for all nodes on the perimeter of the grid, which borders the external face.\nIn general, a planar embedding which maximizes a weighted sum over the nodes bordering a given face can be found in linear time (Gutwenger and Mutzel, 2004); by setting node weights to some measure of their bias, such as the magnitude or square of E0i (4), we can thus efficiently obtain the planar Ising model closest (in that measure) to any given planar binary graphical model.\nIn contrast to submodularity, B-outerplanarity is a structural constraint. This has the advantage that once a model obeying the constraint is selected, inference (e.g., parameter estimation) can proceed via unconstrained methods (e.g., optimization).\nFinally, we note that all our algorithms can be extended to work for non-planar graphs as well. They then take time exponential in the genus of the embedding though still polynomial in the size of the graph; for graphs of low genus this may well be preferable to current approximative methods."

      "text" : "Definition 7 A frustrated cycle O ⊆ E of a graph G(V, E) with non-zero edge weights w is a simple cycle whose product of edge weights is negative, i.e., ∏ o∈O wo < 0. (A simple cycle is a closed path with no repeated edges or vertices.)\nA weighted graph is said to be frustrated if it contains any frustrated cycles. Note that trees can never be frustrated because they do not contain any cycles to begin with.\nThe lowest-energy (ground) state y∗ := argminy E(y) of an unfrustrated Ising model is easily found by labeling nodes as we traverse the graph, flipping our binary label whenever we traverse an edge with negative disagreement cost (as done by Algorithm 1 below when invoked on the cut C = {(i, j) ∈ E : Eij < 0}). This cannot lead to a contradiction because by Definition 7 we will flip the label an even number of times along any cycle in the graph, hence always end a cycle on the same label we started it with.\nThe presence of frustration unfortunately makes the computation of ground states much harder — in fact, it is known to be NP-hard in general (Barahona, 1982). As shown below, the ground state of a planar Ising model can be computed in polynomial time via maximumweight perfect matching on an expanded dual of its embedded graph.\nA relationship between the states of a planar Ising model and perfect matchings (“dimer coverings” to physicists) was first established by Kasteleyn (1961, 1963, 1967) and Fisher (1961, 1966). Perfect matchings in dual graph constructs were used by Bieche et al. (1980) and Barahona (1982) to compute Ising ground states; below we generalize a simpler construction for triangulated graphs due to Globerson and Jaakkola (2007). Working independently, Thomas and Middleton (2007) arrived at the same construction as we did, though their algorithm to compute ground states is less straightforward."

Each edge of the dual crosses exactly one edge of the original graph; due to this one-to-one relationship we will consider the dual to have the same set of edges E (with the same energies) as the original. Since the nodes in the dual are different, however, we will (with some abuse of notation) use a single index for dual edges and their weights, corresponding to the index of the original\nedge in some arbitrary ordering of E . Thus if (i, j) is the kth edge in the (ordered) E , its dual will have weight Ek := Eij .\nWe now expand the dual graph by replacing each node with a q-clique, where q is the degree of the node, as shown in Figure 3 (bottom left) for q = 4. The additional edges internal to each q-clique are given zero energy so as to leave the model unaffected. For large q the introduction of these O(q2) internal edges slows down subsequent computations (solid line in Figure 6, left); this can be avoided by subdividing the offending q-gonal face with chords (which are also given zero energy) before constructing the dual. Our implementation performs best when “octangulating” the graph, i.e., splitting octagons off all faces with q > 13; this is more efficient than a full triangulation (Figure 6, left).\nIt is easily seen that the expanded dual has 2|E| vertices, two for each edge in the original graph. We therefore give the two vertices connected by the dual of the kth edge in E the indices 2k − 1 and 2k. This consistent indexing scheme allows us to run the inference algorithms described in the remainder of this paper without explicitly constructing an expanded dual graph data structure."

Its weight |M| is the sum of the weights of its edges.\nTheorem 10 For every cut C of an embedded graph G(V, E ,Π) there exists at least one (if G is triangulated: exactly one) perfect matching M of its expanded dual complementary to C, i.e., E\\M = C.\nProof sketch Consider the complement E\\C of the cut as a partial matching of the expanded dual. By definition, C intersects any cycle of G, and therefore also the perimeters of G’s faces F , in an even number of edges. In each clique of the expanded dual, C’s complement thus leaves an even number of nodes unmatched;M can therefore be completed using only edges interior to the cliques to pair up unmatched nodes. In a 3-clique, there is only one way to do this, so M is unique if G is triangulated.\nIn other words, there exists a surjection from perfect matchings in the expanded dual of G to cuts in G. Furthermore, since we have given edges interior to the cliques of the expanded dual zero energy, every perfect matching M complementary to a cut C of our Ising model (2) obeys the relation\n|M|+ |C| = ∑\n(i,j)∈E\nEij = const. (7)\nThis means that instead of a minimum-weight cut in a graph we can look for a maximumweight perfect matching in its expanded dual. But will that matching always be complementary to a cut?\nTheorem 11 Every perfect matching M of the expanded dual of a plane graph G(V, E ,Π) is complementary to a cut C of G, i.e., E\\M = C.\nProof sketch In each clique of the expanded dual, an even number of nodes is matched by edges interior to the clique. The complement E\\M of the matching in G thus contains an even number of edges around the perimeter of each face of the embedding. By induction over faces, this holds for every contractible (on the embedding surface) cycle of G. Because a plane is simply connected, all cycles in a plane graph are contractible; E\\M is therefore a cut.\nThis is where planarity matters: Surfaces of non-zero genus are not simply connected, and thus non-plane graphs may contain non-contractible cycles; in the presence of frustration, our construction does not guarantee that the complement E\\M of a perfect matching of the expanded dual contains an even number of edges along such cycles. For planar graphs, however, the above theorems allow us to leverage known polynomial-time algorithms for perfect matchings into inference methods for Ising models. This approach also works for non-planar Ising models that contain no frustrated non-conctractible cycle."

Although the Blossom IV code we are using (Cook and Rohe, 1999) is asymptotically less efficient —O(|E| |V|2) — we have found it to be very fast in practice (Figure 6, left).\nWe can now efficiently compute the lowest-energy state of a planar Ising model as follows: Find a planar embedding of the model graph (Section 2.1), construct its expanded dual (Section 3.1), and run the blossom-shrinking algorithm on that to compute its maximumweight perfect matching. Its complement in the original model is the minimum-weight graph cut (Section 3.2).

As it involves a summation over exponentially many states y, calculating the partition function is generally intractable. For planar graphs, however, the generating function for perfect matchings can be calculated in polynomial time via the determinant of a skew-symmetric matrix (Kasteleyn, 1961, 1963, 1967; Fisher, 1961, 1966), which we call the Kasteleyn matrix K. Due to the close relationship with graph cuts (Section 3.2) we can apply this method to calculate Z in (8). We first convert a planar embedding of the Ising model graph into a Boolean “half-Kasteleyn” matrix H, in four steps which will be elaborated below:\nAlgorithm 1 Find State from Corresponding Graph Cut\nInput: Ising model graph G(V, E), graph cut C(y) ⊆ E 1. ∀ i ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . n} : yi := unknown; 2. dfs state(0, 0);\nOutput: state vector y\nprocedure dfs state(i ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . n}, s ∈ {0, 1}) if yi = unknown then\n1. yi := s; 2. ∀(i, j) ∈ Ei :\nif (i, j) ∈ C then dfs state(j,¬s);\nelse dfs state(j, s); else assert yi = s;\n1. Section 4.1, Algorithm 2: plane triangulate the embedded graph so as to make the relationship between cuts and complementary perfect matchings a bijection (cf. Section 3.2);\n2. Section 4.2, Algorithm 3: orient the edges of the graph such that the in-degree of every node is odd;\n3. Section 4.3, Algorithm 4: construct the Boolean half-Kasteleyn matrix H from the oriented graph;\n4. Section 4.4.3: prefactor the triangulation edges (added in Step 1) out of H.\nOur Step 2 simplifies equivalent operations in previous constructions (Kasteleyn, 1963, 1967; Fisher, 1966; Globerson and Jaakkola, 2007), Step 3 differs in that it only sets unit (i.e., +1) entries in a Boolean matrix, and Step 4 can dramatically reduce the size of H for compact storage (as a bit matrix) and faster subsequent computations (Figure 6).\nFor a given set of edge disagreement costs Ek, k = {1, 2, , . . . |E|} on the Ising model, we then build from H the conventional, real-valued Kasteleyn matrix K by adding the exponentiated disagreement costs along the superdiagonal and skew-symmetrizing:\n1. K := H;\n2. ∀k ∈ {1, 2, , . . . |E|} : K2k−1,2k := K2k−1,2k + eEk ;\n3. K := K −K>.\nWe can now factor K and compute the partition function as Z = √ |K| (Kasteleyn, 1961; Fisher, 1961). The marginal probability of disagreement on the kth edge can likewise be\ncomputed via the inverse of K: P(k ∈ C) := ∑\ny: k∈C(y)\nP(y) = 1 Z ∑ y: k∈C(y) e−E(y)\n= − ∂ lnZ ∂Ek = − 1 Z ∂Z ∂Ek = −1 2|K| ∂|K| ∂Ek\n(9)\n= − 12 tr ( K−1 ∂K\n∂Ek\n) = K−12k−1,2kK2k−1,2k.\nwhere tr denotes the matrix trace, and we have employed the well-known fact that the inverse of an invertible, skew-symmetric, real matrix is skew-symmetric as well. Note the well-known fact that the marginal edge probabilities equal the negative gradient of the log partition function: P(k ∈ C) = −∂ lnZ/∂Ek.\nIn what follows, we elaborate in turn on the operations of plane triangulation (Section 4.1), odd edge orientation (Section 4.2), construction of the half-Kasteleyn matrix H (Section 4.3), and factoring of the Kasteleyn matrixK, resp. prefactoring ofH (Section 4.4)."

H remains valid when disagreement costs change, so we can compute it just once upfront, then re-use it in the parameter estimation loop.\n• H can be stored very compactly as a prefactored bit matrix. As Figure 6 (right) shows, the uncompressed H can be several orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding Kasteleyn matrix K. Row-compressed sparse storage of K (which has exactly 3 non-zero entries in each row and column) is more efficient, but applying the bzip2 compressor1 to the prefactored bit matrix H yields by far the most compact storage format.

We created 50 instances of each image corrupted with pink noise, produced by convolving a white noise image (all pixels i.i.d. uniformly random) with a Gaussian density of one pixel standard deviation. Original and pink noise images were linearly mixed using signal-tonoise (S/N) amplitude ratios of 1 :n, n ∈ N. Figure 7 shows samples of the resulting noisy instances for S/N ratios of 1:6 (second row) and 1:7 (fourth row).\nWe then employed a 64 × 64 square grid (4096 nodes, 8064 edges) planar Ising CRF to denoise the images, with edge energies set to Eij := 〈[1, |xi − xj |],θ〉, where xi is the pixel intensity at node i. The CRF was trained by MM parameter estimation on the 50 noisy instances derived from the first image (Figure 7, left column) only. The gradient (24) was computed by adding the contributions from all 50 training instances to that of the regularizer, with λ = 100. The MAP states of the CRF for all 150 noisy instances of the other three images were then interpreted as attempted reconstructions of the original images. We did not employ a bias node for this task, instead disambiguating MAP states by calling “white” whichever state the majority of the nodes on the perimeter of the grid were in.\n3. Thomas and Middleton (2007) employ a similar approach to obtain the ground state from a given state y∗ by setting up an isomorphic Ising model with disagreement costs (1− 2 [k ∈ C(y∗)])Ek.\nRows 3 and 5 of Figure 7 show the reconstructions obtained from the noisy instances shown in rows 2 and 4, respectively. At low noise levels (n < 6) we obtained perfect reconstruction of the original images. At an S/N ratio of 1:6 the first small reconstruction errors do creep in (Figure 7, third row), even though over 99.7% of the nodes (and over 99.8% the edges) are still predicted correctly. At the 1:7 S/N ratio, these figures drop to 98.2% (nodes) and 98.8% (edges), and the errors become far more noticeable (Figure 7, bottom row). For higher noise levels (n > 7) the reconstructions rapidly deteriorate as the noise finally overwhelms the signal.

AS before, the energy of the other edges was set to Eij := 〈[1, |xi − xj |],θ〉, where xi is the pixel intensity at node i. We did not employ a bias node for this task, and simply set the regularization constant to λ = 1.\nNote that this is a huge model: 10 000 nodes and 19 801 edges. Computing the partition function or marginals would require inverting a Kasteleyn matrix with over 1.5 ·109 entries; minimizing (18) is therefore computationally infeasible for us. Computing a ground state via the algorithm described in Section 3, by contrast, takes only 0.3 seconds on an Apple MacBook with 2.2 GHz Intel Core2 Duo processor. We can therefore efficiently minimize (20) to obtain the MM parameter vector θ∗, then compute the CRF’s MAP (i.e., ground) state for rapid prediction.\nAs before, we titrated for the smallest S/N ratio of the form 1:n for which we obtained a good segmentation; depending on the image this occurred for n = 7 or 8. Figure 8 (right column) shows that at these noise levels our approach is capable of recovering the original segmentation boundary quite well, with less than 1% of nodes mislabeled. For S/N ratios of 1:9 and lower the system was unable to locate the boundary; for S/N ratios of 1:7 and higher we obtained perfect reconstruction. Again this corresponded closely to our human ability to visually locate the segmentation boundary accurately."

Besides proving efficient and effective in first experiments, our approach opens up a number of interesting research directions to be explored:\nOur algorithms can all be extended to nonplanar graphs, at a cost exponential in the genus of the embedding. We are currently developing these extensions, which may prove of great practical value for graphs that are “almost” planar; examples include road networks (where edge crossings arise from overpasses without on-ramps) and graphs describing the tertiary structure of proteins (Vishwanathan et al., 2007).\nOur algorithms also provide a foundation for efforts to develop efficient approximate inference methods for nonplanar Ising models.\nOur method for calculating the ground state (Section 3) actually works for nonplanar graphs whose ground state does not contain frustrated non-contractible cycles. The QPBO graph cut method (Kolmogorov and Rother, 2007) finds ground states that do not contain any frustrated cycles, and otherwise yields a partial labeling. Can we likewise obtain a partial labeling of ground states with frustrated non-contractible cycles?\nThe existence of two distinct tractable frameworks for inference in binary graphical models implies a yet more powerful hybrid: Consider a graph each of whose biconnected components is either planar or submodular. As a whole, this graph may be neither planar nor submodular, yet efficient exact inference in it is clearly possible by applying the appropriate framework to each component. Can this hybrid approach be extended to cover less obvious situations?\nAbout NICTA\nNICTA is a national research institute with a charter to build Australia’s pre-eminent centre of excellence for information and communications technology (ICT).

Our approach provides an interesting alternative to the well-known graph cut paradigm in that it does not impose any submodularity constraints; instead we require planarity to establish a correspondence with perfect matchings (dimer coverings) in an expanded dual graph. We implement a unified framework while delegating complex but well-understood subproblems (planar embedding, maximum-weight perfect matching) to established algorithms for which efficient implementations are freely available. Unlike graph cut methods, we can perform penalized maximum-likelihood as well as maximum-margin parameter estimation in the associated conditional random fields (CRFs), and employ marginal probabilities as well as maximum a posteriori (MAP) states for prediction. Maximum-margin CRF parameter estimation on image denoising and segmentation problems shows our approach to be efficient and effective.",
