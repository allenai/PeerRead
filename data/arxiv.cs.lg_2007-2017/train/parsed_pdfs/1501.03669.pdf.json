      "text" : "Sparsity-inducing penalties are useful tools to design multiclass support vector machines (SVMs). In this paper, we propose a convex optimization approach for efficiently and exactly solving the multiclass SVM learning problem involving a sparse regularization and the multiclass hinge loss formulated by [1]. We provide two algorithms: the first one dealing with the hinge loss as a penalty term, and the other one addressing the case when the hinge loss is enforced through a constraint. The related convex optimization problems can be efficiently solved thanks to the flexibility offered by recent primal-dual proximal algorithms and epigraphical splitting techniques. Experiments carried out on several datasets demonstrate the interest of considering the exact expression of the hinge loss rather than a smooth approximation. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms w.r.t. several state-of-the-art methods is also assessed through comparisons of execution times."

      "text" : "Support vector machines (SVMs) have gained much popularity in solving large-scale classification problems. As a matter of fact, many applications considered in the literature deal with a large amount of training data or a huge (even infinite) number of classes [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Consequently, the major difficulty encountered in this kind of applications stems from the computational cost. The SVM learning problem is classically solved by using standard Lagrangian duality techniques [7, 1]. This approach brings in several advantages, such as the kernel trick [8], or the possibility to break the problem down into a sequence of smaller ones [9, 10]. Some works also proposed to approximate the dual problem using cutting plane approaches, in order to address scenarios with thousands or even an infinite number of classes [3, 6].\n∗This work was supported by the CNRS IMAG’in OPTIMISME project †G.

This is undoubtedly true in medical contexts, where the goal is to classify a patient as being “healthy”, “contaminated”, or “infected”, but the verified cases of infected patients might be just a few. In such applications, the lack of training data may lead to the so-called overfitting problem, eventually leading to a prediction which is too strongly tailored to the particularities of the training set and poorly generalizes to new data.\nA common solution to prevent overfitting consists of introducing a sparsity-inducing regularization in order to perform an implicit feature selection that gets rid of irrelevant or noisy features. In this respect, the `1-norm and, more generally, the `1,p-norm regularization have attracted much attention over the past decade [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. However, when a sparse regularization is introduced, the dual approach does no longer yield a simple formulation. Therefore, SVMs with sparse regularization lead to a nonsmooth convex optimization problem which is challenging. The main objective of this paper is to exactly and efficiently solve the multiclass SVM learning problem for convex regularizations. To this end, we propose two algorithms based on a primal-dual proximal method [19, 20] and a novel epigraphical splitting technique [21]. In addition to more detailed theoretical developments, this paper extends our preliminary work [22] by providing a new algorithm, and a larger number of experiments including comparisons with state-of-the-art methods for different types of database."

      "text" : "The use of sparse regularization in SVMs was firstly proposed in the context of binary classification. The idea traces back to the work by [23], who demonstrated that the `1-norm regularization can effectively perform “feature selection” by shrinking small coefficients to zero. Other forms of regularization have also been studied, such as the `0-norm [24], the `p-norm with p > 0 [25], the `∞-norm [26], and the combination of `0-`1 norms [27] or `1-`2 norms [28]. A different solution was proposed by [29], who reformulated the SVM learning problem by using an indicator vector (its components being either equal to 0 or 1) to model the active features, and solved the resulting combinatorial problem by convex relaxation using a cutting-plane algorithm. More recently, [30] proposed an accelerated algorithm for `1-regularized SVMs involving the square hinge loss. They also proposed a procedure for handling nonconvex regularization (using the reweighted `1-minimization scheme by [31]), showing that nonconvex penalties lead to similar prediction quality while using less features than convex ones.\nBinary SVMs can be turned into multiclass classifiers by a variety of strategies, such as the one-vs-all approach [7, 32]. While these techniques provide a simple and powerful framework, they cannot capture the correlations between different classes, since they break a multiclass problem into multiple independent binary problems. [1] therefore proposed a direct formulation of multiclass SVMs by generalizing the notion of margins used in the binary case. A natural idea thus consists of equipping muticlass SVMs with sparse regularization. A simple example is the `1-regularized multiclass SVM, which can be addressed by linear programming techniques [33]. In multiclass problems however, feature selection becomes more complex than in the binary case, since multiple discriminating functions need to be estimated, each one with its own set of important features. For this reason, mixed-norm regularization has recently attracted much interest due to its ability\nto impose group sparsity [34, 35, 12, 36]. In the context of multiclass SVMs, [37] proposed to deal with the `1,∞-norm regularization by reformulating the SVM learning problem in terms of linear programming. However, they validated their method on small-size problems, indicating that the linear reformulation may be inefficient for larger-size ones. More recently, [38] proposed an algorithm to handle `1,2-regularized SVMs involving a smooth loss function. While their method is efficient and can handle other convex regularizations, it does not solve rigorously the multiclass SVM learning problem, possibly leading to performance limitations."

Unfortunately, this constraint has no practical interest for learning purposes, as it becomes infeasible when the training set is not fully separable. Multiclass SVMs overcome this issue by introducing the notion of soft margins, which consists of adding a vector of slack variables ξ = (ξ(`))1≤`≤L into (2):(∀` ∈ {1, ..., L}) maxk 6=z` ϕ(u`) >(x(k) − x(z`)) ≤ ξ(`) − µ`,\n(∀` ∈ {1, ..., L}) ξ(`) ≥ 0, (3)\nThe multiclass SVM learning problem is thus obtained by adding a quadratic regularization [1], yielding2\nminimize (x,ξ)∈R(M+1)K×RL K∑ k=1 ‖x(k)‖22 + λ L∑ `=1\nξ(`) s. t.(∀` ∈ {1, ..., L}) maxk 6=z` ϕ(u`) >(x(k) − x(z`)) ≤ ξ(`) − µ`,\n(∀` ∈ {1, ..., L}) ξ(`) ≥ 0, (4)\nwhere λ ∈ ]0,+∞[.

The interest of considering the constrained formulation lies in the fact that η may be easier to set, since it is directly related to the properties of the training data.\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the regularization term g is chosen so as to promote some form of sparsity. A popular example is the `1-norm, as it ensures that the solution will have a number of coefficients exactly equal to zero, depending on the strength of the regularization [15]. Another example is given by the mixed `1,p-norm. For every x ∈ R(M+1)K , let us assume that, for each k ∈ {1, . . . ,K}, the vector x(k) ∈ RM+1 is block-decomposed as follows:\nx(k) = [ ( x(k,1) )> ︸ ︷︷ ︸\nsizeM1\n. . .

In this context, the exponent values p = 2 or p = +∞ are the most popular choices. In particular, the `1,∞-norm tends to favor solutions with few nonzero groups having components of similar magnitude."

In the convex optimization literature, proximal algorithms constitute\none of the most efficient approaches to deal with nonsmooth problems [41, 42, 15, 43, 44].

The proof of this new result follows the same line as the proof by [21, Proposition 5], where we derived the epigraphical projection associated to the `∞-norm.\nThe decomposition in (14) yields two potential benefits. Firstly, the projection Pepih` is computed onto the lower-dimensional convex subset epih` of RK ×R, whose dimensionality is only\nfixed by the number K of classes. Secondly, these projections can be computed in parallel, since they are defined over disjoint blocks whose number is given by the cardinality L of the training set (we refer to [51] for an example of parallel implementation on GP-GPUs).\nProposition 3.3.

[53, Algorithm 2] for implementing the projection onto the `1-ball.\nThe closed-form expression of this proximity operator, as well as the projection onto epih`, are derived in the following. In order to prove (15), we need to compute the proximity operator of ϕ` defined in (18). Such a function belongs to Γ0(R) since, for each k∈{1, . . . ,K}, max{(ν(`,k)− ·), 0} is finite convex and (·)2 is finite convex and increasing on [0,+∞[. In addition, ϕ` is differentiable and such that, for every v ∈ R and k ∈ {1, . . . ,K + 1},\nν(`,k−1) < v ≤ ν(`,k) ⇒ ϕ`(v) = 1\n2 K∑ j=k ( v − ν(`,j) )2 .\nTherefore, there exists a k̄(`) ∈ {1, . . . ,K + 1} such that ν(`,k̄(`)−1) < θ(`) ≤ ν(`,k̄(`)), which yields (16).

For the regularization, we used `1,2-norm in the same way as [38]. Moreover, in order to evaluate the performance, we trained a classifier on 10 different training subsets of size L ∈ {5K, 10K, 50K}, we computed the classification errors by evaluating the 10 trained classifiers on the whole test set, and we averaged the resulting errors."

Our objective here is to show that the exact hinge loss allows us to achieve better performance than its approximated smooth versions, especially with a few training data. Hence, we compare the proposed method with the following approaches:\n• the multiclass SVM proposed by [38]\nminimize x∈R(M+1)K g(x) + λ L∑ `=1 ∑ k 6=z` ( max { 0, µ` + ϕ(u`) >(x(k) − x(z`)) })2 , (19)\n• the multinomial logistic regression (e.g., see [11])\nminimize x∈R(M+1)K g(x) + λ L∑ `=1 log\n( 1 +\n∑ k 6=z` exp { µ` + ϕ(u`) >(x(k) − x(z`)) }) .

Note that (21) may be seen as a special case of (19).\nIn the following, we refer to Problems (7)-(8) as hinge, and to Problems (19)-(21), respectively, as square, logit, and one-vs-all. Since the parameters λ and η need to be estimated (e.g., through cross validation), it is important to evaluate the impact of their choice on the performance, although it is out of the scope of this paper to devise an optimal strategy to set this bound. To compare the above methods for different choices of these parameters, we set λ = α−1 or η = αL, by varying α inside a fixed set of predefined values. We also follow the usual convention of setting µ` ≡ 1.\n6Data available at www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/dengcai/Data/TextData.html"

In this experiment, the execution times refer to a stopping criterion of 10−5 on the relative error between two consecutive iterates. Conversely, Figures 3b, 3d and 3f show the relative distance to ‖x[i] − x[∞]‖/‖x[∞]‖ (as a function of time) for the values of λ and η yielding the best accuracy (as reported in Figure 1), where x[∞] denotes the solution computed with a stopping criterion of 10−5. These results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are faster than the approaches based on linear constraints and logistic regression, while being comparable in terms of execution times to approaches based on the square hinge loss. In addition, Algorithm 2 turns out to converge faster than Algorithm 1. This can be explained by the higher computational cost of the projection onto the standard simplex."

      "text" : "We have proposed two efficient algorithms for learning a sparse multiclass SVM. Our approach makes it possible to minimize a criterion involving the multiclass hinge loss and a sparsity-inducing regularization. In the literature, such a criterion is typically approximated by replacing the hinge loss with a smooth penalty, such as the quadratic hinge loss or the logistic loss. In this paper, we have provided two solutions that directly deal with the hinge loss: one addressing the regularized formulation and the other one adapted to the constrained formulation. The performance of the proposed solutions have been evaluated over three databases in scenarios with a few training data. The results show that the use of the hinge loss, rather than an approximation, leads to a slightly better classification accuracy and tends to make the method more robust w.r.t. the choice of the regularization parameter, while the proposed algorithms are often faster than state-of-the-art solutions."

In this paper, we propose a convex optimization approach for efficiently and exactly solving the multiclass SVM learning problem involving a sparse regularization and the multiclass hinge loss formulated by [1]. We provide two algorithms: the first one dealing with the hinge loss as a penalty term, and the other one addressing the case when the hinge loss is enforced through a constraint. The related convex optimization problems can be efficiently solved thanks to the flexibility offered by recent primal-dual proximal algorithms and epigraphical splitting techniques. Experiments carried out on several datasets demonstrate the interest of considering the exact expression of the hinge loss rather than a smooth approximation. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms w.r.t. several state-of-the-art methods is also assessed through comparisons of execution times.",
