      "text" : "Traditional NLP approaches dominantly use simple bagof-word representations of documents and sentences, but recent approaches that use distributed representation of words, by constructing a so-called ”word embedding”, have been shown effective across many different NLP tasks (Weston et al., 2014). Mikolov et al. introduced efficient strategies to learn embeddings from text corpora, which are collectively known as Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013). They have shown that simply increasing the volume of training data improves the semantic and syntactic generalizations that are automatically encoded in embedding space, and therefore efficiency is the key to increase the potential of this technique.\nProceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning, New York, NY, USA, 2016. JMLR: W&CP volume 48. Copyright 2016 by the author(s).\nIn recent work, Ji et al. argue that the current implementations of Word2Vec do not scale well over the number of used cores, and propose a solution that uses higherlevel linear algebra functions to improve the efficiency of Word2Vec using negative sampling (Ji et al., 2016). In this work, we analyze the scalability problem and conclude it is mainly caused by simultaneous access of the same memory by multiple threads. As a straightforward solution, we propose to cache frequently updated vectors, and show a large gain in efficiency as a result."

      "text" : "Bengio et al. propose to learn a distributed representation for words in an embedding space based on the words that immediately precede a word in natural language (Bengio et al., 2006). They use a shallow neural network architecture to learn a vector-space representation for words comparable to those obtained in latent semantic indexing. Recently, Mikolov et al. proposed a very efficient way to learn embeddings over large text corpora called Word2Vec (Mikolov et al., 2013), which produces stateof-the-art results on various tasks, such as word similarity, word analogy tasks, named entity recognition, machine translation and question answering (Weston et al., 2014). Word2vec uses Stochastic Gradient Descent to optimize the vector representations by iteratively learning on words that appear jointly in text.\nFor efficient learning of word embeddings, Mikolov et al. proposed two strategies that avoid having to update the probability of observing every word in the vocabulary. Negative sampling consists of updating observed word pairs together with a limited number of random word pairs to regularize weights. Alternatively, a hierarchical softmax is used as a learning objective, for which the output\nlayer is transformed into a binary Huffmann tree and instead of predicting an observed word, the model learns the word’s position in the Huffmann tree by the left and right turns at each inner node along its path from the root.\nThe original Word2Vec implementation uses a Hogwild strategy of allowing processors lock-free access to shared memory, in which they can update at will (Recht et al., 2011). Recht et al. show that when data access is sparse memory overwrites are rare and barely introduce error when they occur. However, Ji et al. notice that for training Word2Vec this strategy does not use computational resources efficiently (Ji et al., 2016). They propose to use level-3 BLAS routines on specific CPU’s to operate on a mini-batches, which is then updated to the main memory and reduces the access to main memory. They address the Word2Vec variant that uses negative sampling. In our work we address the hierarchical softmax variant, and show that straightforward caching of frequently occurring data is sufficient to improve efficiency on conventional hardware."

      "text" : "For faster training of models, commonly, the input is processed in parallel by multiple processors. One strategy is to map the input into separate batches and aggregating the results in a reduce step. Alternatively, multithreading can be used on a single model in shared memory, which is used by the original Word2Vec implementation in C as well as the widely used Gensim package for Python. We analyzed how the learning times scale over the used number of cores with Word2Vec, and noticed the total run time appears to be optimal when using approximately 8 cores, beyond which efficiency degrades (see Figure 1).\nJi et al. analyze this problem and conclude that multiple threads can cause conflicts when they attempt to update the same memory (Ji et al., 2016). Current Word2Vec implementations simply ignore memory conflicts between threads, however, concurrent attempts to read and update the same memory increases memory access latency. This Hogwild strategy was introduced under the assumption that memory overwrites are rare, however, for natural language memory collisions may be more likely than for other data given the skew towards frequently occurring words. Collisions are even more likely when learning against a hierarchical softmax, since the top nodes in the Huffmann tree are used by a large part of the vocabulary."

      "text" : "For efficient learning of word embeddings with negative sampling, Ji et al. propose a mini-batch strategy that uses a level-3 BLAS function to multiply a matrix that consists of\nall words that share the same context word (e.g. with a window size of 5 up to 10 words would train against the same context term), with a matrix that contains the context word and a shared set of negative samples (Ji et al., 2016). Efficiency is improved up to 3.6x over the original Word2Vec implementation, by the leveraging the improved ability for matrix-matrix multiplication in high-end CPU’s, and only updating the model after each mini-batch. Typically, the batches are limited to about 10-20 words for convergence reasons, reporting only a marginal loss of accuracy.\nWe suspect that for parallel training a model in shared memory the real bottleneck is latency caused by concurrent access of the same memory. The solution that is presented by (Ji et al., 2016) uses level-3 BLAS functions to perform matrix-matrix multiplications, which implicitly lowers the number of times shared memory is accessed and updated. We alternatively propose a straightforward caching strategy that provides a comparable efficiency gain over the hierarchical softmax variant, that is less hardware dependent since it does not need highly optimized level-3 BLAS functions. When using the hierarchical softmax, efficiency is more affected by memory conflicts than with negative sampling; the root node of the tree is in every word’s path and therefore gives a conflict every time, the direct children of the root will be in the path of half the vocabulary, etc. When each thread caches the most frequently used upper nodes of the tree and only updates the change to main memory after a number of trained words, the number of memory conflicts is reduced.\nAlgorithm 1 describes the caching in pseudocode, in which for the most frequently used inner nodes in the Huffmann tree a local copy is created and used for the updates and the non frequently used inner nodes are updated in shared memory. After processing a number of words (typically in the range 10 to 100) for every cached weight vector the update is computed by subtracting the original value when cached and adding this update to the weight vector in main memory. The vectors are processed using level-1 BLAS functions, scopy to copy a vector, sdot to compute the dot product between two vectors and saxpy to add a scalar multiplied by the first vector to the second vector.\nThe proposed caching strategy is implemented in Python/Cython and published as part of the Cythnn open source project1."

      "text" : "In Figure 1, we compare the changes in total run time when adding more cores between the original Word2Vec C implementation, Gensim, Cythnn without caching (c0) and Cythnn when caching the 31 most frequently used nodes in the Huffmann tree (c31). The first observation is that Word2Vec and Cythnn without caching do have degrading efficiencies beyond the use of 8 cores, while Gensim is apparently more optimized to use up to 16 cores. The run of Cythnn that caches the 31 top-vectors (157 sec) performs up to 3.9x faster than the fastest C-run (630 sec) and up to 2.5x faster than the fastest Gensim run (385 sec).\nIn Figure 2 we compare the execution time of Cythnn when changing the number of cached top level nodes in the Huffmann tree over different numbers of cores used. Interestingly, caching just the root node (#cached nodes=1) has the highest impact on efficiency, and reduces the execution time by more than 40% when using more than 20 cores. This supports the idea that the reduction of concurrent access of the same memory is key to improving efficiency. Since the root node in the Huffmann tree is in the path of every word in the vocabulary, caching just this node improves most. On the Text8 dataset the improvement is near optimal when caching at least the top-15 nodes in the tree. In our experiments, using more than 24 cores is slightly counter effective, possibly indicating that memory bandwidth is fully used."

      "text" : "Ji et al. compared the effectiveness between their approach and the original Word2Vec implementation and report that processing in mini-batches has a marginal but noticeable negative effect on the accuracy of the embeddings learned. In Table 1, we show the average accuracy of each system over the runs of 2-28 cores, where the accuracy was computed using the evaluation tool and question-words test set that is packaged with Word2Vec3. The results show a higher accuracy for Gensim, but we have found no documentation that helps to explain this difference. Using Cythnn, caching does not result in lower effectiveness as reported by (Ji et al., 2016), a difference being that our caching approach always uses updated vectors within a thread whereas the BLAS-3 solution does not use updated vectors within a mini-batch.\nWhen varying cache update frequency u, we expect a tradeoff between training efficiency and model accuracy. In practice, our experiments show, that this balance is a slowly shifting one that is further influenced by the chosen window size n. Using the default window size of n = 5, updating the cache after each training word (u = 1) is as efficient as flushing after u = 10 words. For this paper, cached updates were written back to shared memory every 10 words."

The original Word2Vec implementation is most efficient when trained using 8 cores and becomes less efficient when more cores are added. We propose a straightforward caching strategy that caches the weight vectors that are used most frequently, and updates their change to main memory after a short delay reducing concurrent access of shared memory. We compared the efficiency of this strategy against existing Word2Vec implementations and show up to 4x improvement in efficiency."
