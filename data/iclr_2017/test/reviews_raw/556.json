While I think the paper is somewhat below the standard of a conference paper (see detailed comments below), I would definitely love to see a version of this paper published with some of the issues ironed out. I also agree with many of the points raised by other reviewers and will not repeat them here.\n\nMajor points:\n\n-- \"As we saw in the previous section, the minima of deep network loss functions are for the most part decent.\"\n\nAll you said in the previous section was that theory shows that there are no bad minima under \"strong assumptions\". There is no practical proof that minima do not vary in quality.\n\n-- \"This implies that we probably do not need to take many precautions to avoid bad minima in practice. If all minima are decent, then the task of finding a \"decent minima quickly\" is reduced to the task of finding any minima quickly.\"\n\nFirst of all, as one of the reviewers pointed out, we are never guaranteed in practice to actually reach a local minimum. We could always hit a region of the objective function where the algorithm makes essentially no further progress. The final error level, in practice, actually does depend significantly on many factors such as (i) optimization algorithm (ii) learning rate schedule (iii) initialization of weights (iv) presence of unsupervised pretraining (v) whether neurons are added or eliminated during training etc. etc. Therefore, the task of optimizing neural networks is far from being \"reduced to finding any minima quickly\".\n\n-- Figure 1\n \nI don't like Figure 1, because it suggests to me that you diagnosed exactly where the transition between the two phases happened, which I don't think you did.\n \nAlso, the concept of having a fast-decaying error followed by a slow-decaying error is simple enough for readers to understand without a dedicated graph. Minor point on presentation: The red brace is positioned lower in the figure than the blue brace and the braces don't join up horizontally. Please be more careful.\n\n-- Misuse of the transient phase / minimization phase concept\n\nIn section 4.3, you talk about the transient and minimization phase of optimization. However, you have no way of diagnosing when or if your algorithm reaches the minimization phase. You seem to think that the minimization phase is simply the part of the optimization process where the error decreases slowly. AFAIK, this is not the case. The minimization phase is where the optimization algorithm enters the vicinity of the local minimum that can be approximated by the second-order Taylor expansion. For this to even occur, one would have to verify, for example, that the learning rate is small enough. You change the algorithm after 25%, 50% and 75% of training, but these points seem arbitrary. What is the minimization phase was reached at 99%, or 10 epochs after you decided to stop training?\n\n-- Only 1 dataset\n \nYou run most experiments on only 1 dataset (CIFAR). Please replicate with at least one more dataset.\n \n-- Many figures are unclear\n \nFor each figure, the following information are relevant: network used; dataset used; learning rate used; batch norm yes / no; whether figure shows train, test, or validation error. It should be easy for the reader to ascertain this information for all figures, not just for some.\n \n-- You say at the beginning of section 4.1 that each algorithm finds a different minimum as if this is a significant finding. However, this is obvious because the updates taken by these algorithms vary wildly. Keep in mind that there is an exponentially large number of minima. The probability of different algorithms choosing the same minimum is essentially zero because of their sheer number. The same would be true if you even shift the learning rate slightly or use a different random seed for minibatch generation etc. etc.\n  \n-- Lack of confidence intervals\n\nThe value of Figures 1, 2, 3 and 6 is limited is because it is unclear how these plots would change if the random seed were changed. We only get information for a single weight initialization and a single minibatch sequence. While figures 5 and 7 can be used to try and infer what confidence intervals around plots in figures 1, 2, 3 and 6 might look like, I think those confidence intervals should still be shown for at least a subset of the configurations presented.\n\n-- Lack of information regarding learning rate\n\nThere is big question mark left open regarding how all your results would change if different learning rates were used. You don't even tell us how you chose the learning rates from the intervals you gave in section 3.4.\n\n-- Lack of information regarding the absolute distance of interpolated points\n\nIn most figures, you interpolate between two or three trained weight configuration. However, you do not say how far the interpolated points are apart. This is highly significant, because if points are close together and there is a big \"hump\" between them, it means that those points are more \"brittle\" than if they are far apart and there is a big \"hump\" between them.\n \nMinor points:\n \n-- LSTM is not a fixed network architecture like NiN or VGG, but a layer type. LSTM would be equivalent to CNN. Also, the VGG paper has multiple versions of VGG. You should specify which one you used.\n  \n-- The font size for the legends in the upper triangle of Table 1 is too small. You can't just write \"best viewed in zoom\" in the table caption and pretend that somehow fixes the problem.

It heavily re-uses the approach of Goodfellow et al. (2015). I find it hard to understand the contributions of the paper, for example: is it surprising that different algorithms reach different solutions when starting from the same initialization? It would be useful if the authors build such basic intuition in the paper. I also did not receive a clear answer to the question I posed to reviewers regarding clarifying how does the findings of the paper can contribute to future works on optimization in deep learning. And this is what I find fundamentally missing. So for example, there are probably plenty of ways to modify approach of Goodfellow et al. (2015), and similar works, and come up with interesting visualization methods for deep learning - but the question is: how is this helpful in terms of designing better algorithms, gaining more intuition how the optimization surface looks like in general, etc.?
