      "text" : "Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has become the new state-of-the-art in several language pairs. However, it remains a challenging problem how to integrate NMT with a bilingual dictionary which mainly contains words rarely or never seen in the bilingual training data. In this paper, we propose two methods to bridge NMT and the bilingual dictionaries. The core idea behind is to design novel models that transform the bilingual dictionaries into adequate sentence pairs, so that NMT can distil latent bilingual mappings from the ample and repetitive phenomena. One method leverages a mixed word/character model and the other attempts at synthesizing parallel sentences guaranteeing massive occurrence of the translation lexicon. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods can remarkably improve the translation quality, and most of the rare words in the test sentences can obtain correct translations if they are covered by the dictionary."

      "text" : "Due to its superior ability in modelling the end-to-end translation process, neural machine translation (NMT), recently proposed by (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014), has become the novel paradigm and achieved the new state-of-the-art translation performance for several language pairs, such as English-to-French, English-to-German and Chinese-to-English (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2014; Luong et al., 2015b; Sennrich et al., 2015b; Wu et al., 2016).\nTypically, NMT adopts the encoder-decoder architecture which consists of two recurrent neural networks. The encoder network models the semantics of the source sentence and transforms the source sentence into the context vector representation, from which the decoder network generates the target translation word by word.\nOne important feature of NMT is that each word in the vocabulary is mapped into a lowdimensional real-valued vector (word embedding). The use of continuous representations enables NMT to learn latent bilingual mappings for accurate translation and explore the statistical similarity between words (e.g. desk and table) as well. As a disadvantage of the statistical models, NMT can learn good word embeddings and accurate bilingual mappings only when the words occur frequently in the parallel sentence pairs. However, low-frequency words are ubiquitous, especially when the training data is not enough (e.g. lowresource language pairs). Fortunately, in many language pairs and domains, we have handmade bilingual dictionaries which mainly contain words rarely or never seen in the training corpus. Therefore, it remains a big challenge how to bridge NMT and the bilingual dictionaries.\nRecently, Arthur et al. (2016) attempt at incorporating discrete translation lexicons into NMT. The main idea of their method is leveraging the discrete translation lexicons to positively influence the probability distribution of the output words in the NMT softmax layer. However, their approach only addresses the translation lexicons which are in the restricted vocabulary 1 of NMT. The out-ofvocabulary (OOV) words are out of their consideration.\n1NMT usually keeps only the words whose occurrence is more than a threshold (e.g. 10), since very rare words can not yield good embeddings and large vocabulary leads to high computational complexity.\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n07 27\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n4 O\nct 2\n01 6\nIn this paper, we aim at making full use of all the bilingual dictionaries, especially the ones covering the rare or OOV words. Our basic idea is to transform the low-frequency word pair in bilingual dictionaries into adequate sequence pairs which guarantee the frequent occurrence of the word pair, so that NMT can learn translation mappings between the source word and the target word.\nTo achieve this goal, we propose two methods, as shown in Fig. 1. In the test sentence, the Chinese word ľihuā appears only once in our training data and the baseline NMT cannot correctly translate this word. Fortunately, our bilingual dictionary contains this translation lexicon. Our first method extends the mixed word/character model proposed by Wu et al. (2016) to re-label the rare words in both of the dictionary and training data with character sequences in which characters are now frequent and the character translation mappings can be learnt by NMT. Instead of backing off words into characters, our second method is well designed to synthesize adequate pseudo sentence pairs containing the translation lexicon, allowing NMT to learn the word translation mappings.\nWe make the following contributions in this paper:\n• We propose a low-frequency to highfrequency framework to bridge NMT and the bilingual dictionaries.\n• We propose and investigate two methods to utilize the bilingual dictionaries. One ex-\ntends the mixed word/character model and the other designs a pseudo sentence pair synthesis model.\n• The extensive experiments on Chinese-toEnglish translation show that our proposed methods significantly outperform the strong attention-based NMT. We further find that most of rare words can be correctly translated, as long as they are covered by the bilingual dictionary."

      "text" : "Our framework bridging NMT and the discrete bilingual dictionaries can be applied in any neural machine translation model. Without loss of generality, we use the attention-based NMT proposed by (Luong et al., 2015b), which utilizes stacked Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM, (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997)) layers for both encoder and decoder as illustrated in Fig. 2.\nThe encoder-decoder NMT first encodes the source sentence X = (x1, x2, · · · , xTx) into a sequence of context vectors C = (h1,h2, · · · ,hTx) whose size varies with respect to the source sentence length. Then, the encoder-decoder NMT decodes from the context vectors C and generates target translation Y = (y1, y2, · · · , yTy) one word each time by maximizing the probability of p(yi|y<i, C). Note that xj (yi) is word embedding corresponding to the jth (ith) word in the source (target) sentence. Next, we briefly review the en-\ncoder introducing how to obtainC and the decoder addressing how to calculate p(yi|y<i, C).\nEncoder: The context vectors C = (hm1 ,h m 2 , · · · ,hmTx) are generated by the encoder using m stacked LSTM layers. hkj is calculated as follows:\nhkj = LSTM(h k j−1,h k−1 j ) (1)\nWhere hk−1j = xj if k = 1. Decoder: The conditional probability p(yi|y<i, C) is computed in different ways according to the choice of the context C at time i. In (Cho et al., 2014), the authors choose C = hmTx , while Bahdanau et al. (2014) use different context ci at different time step and the conditional probability will become:\np(yi|y<i, C) = p(yi|y<i, ci) = softmax(Wẑi)) (2)\nwhere ẑi is the attention output:\nẑi = tahn(Wc[z l i; ci]) (3)\nThe attention model calculates ci as the weighted sum of the source-side context vectors, just as illustrated in the middle part of Fig. 2.\nci = Tx∑ j=1 αijz l i (4)\nwhere αij is a normalized item calculated as follows:\nαij = hmj · zli∑ j′ h m j′ · zli\n(5)\nzki is computed using the following formula:\nzki = LSTM(z k i−1, z k−1 i ) (6)\nIf k = 1, z1i will be calculated by combining ẑi−1 as feed input (Luong et al., 2015b):\nz1i = LSTM(z 1 i−1, yi−1, ẑi−1) (7)\nGiven the sentence aligned bilingual training data Db = {(X (n) b , Y (n) b )} N n=1 , all the parameters of the encoder-decoder NMT are optimized to maximize the following conditional loglikelihood:\nL(θ) = 1 N N∑ n=1 Ty∑ i=1 logp(y (n) i |y (n) <i , X (n), θ) (8)"

We all know that words\nare composed of characters and most of the characters are frequent even though the word is never seen. This idea is popularly used to deploy open vocabulary NMT (Ling et al., 2015; Costa-Jussà and Fonollosa, 2016; Chung et al., 2016).\nCharacter translation mappings are much easier to learn for NMT than word translation mappings. However, given a character sequence of a source language word, NMT cannot guarantee the generated character sequence would lead to a valid target language word. Therefore, we prefer the framework mixing the words and characters, which is employed by Wu et al. (2016) to handle OOV words. If it is a frequent word, we keep it unchanged. Otherwise, we fall back to the character sequence.\nWe perform data transformation on both parallel training corpus and bilingual dictionaries. Here, English sentences and words are adopted as examples. Suppose we keep the English vocabulary V in which the frequency of each word exceeds a threshold K. For each English word w (e.g. oak) in a parallel sentence pair (Xb, Yb) or in a translation lexicon (Dicx, Dicy), if w ∈ V , w will be left as it is. Otherwise, w is re-labelled by character sequence. For example, oak will be:\noak → 〈B〉o 〈M〉a 〈E〉k (9)\nWhere 〈B〉, 〈M〉 and 〈E〉 denotes respectively begin, middle and end of a word."

      "text" : "Since NMT is a data driven approach, it can learn latent translation mappings for a word pair (Dicx, Dicy) if these exist many parallel sentences containing (Dicx, Dicy). Along this line, we propose the pseudo sentence pair synthesis model. In this model, we aim at synthesizing for a rare or unknown translation lexicon (Dicx, Dicy) the adequate pseudo parallel sentences {(Xjp , Y jp )}Jj=1 each of which contains (Dicx, Dicy).\nAlthough there are no enough bilingual sentence pairs in many languages (and many domains), a huge amount of the monolingual data is available in the web. In this paper, we plan to make use of the source-side monolingual data Dsm = {(X(m)sm }Mm=1 (M N ) to synthesize the pseudo bilingual sentence pairs Dbp = {(Xjp , Y jp )}Jj=1.\nFor constructingDbp, we resort to statistical machine translation (SMT) and apply a self-learning\nAlgorithm 1 Pseudo Sentence Pair Synthesis.

In contrast to NMT, statistical machine translation (SMT, e.g. phrase-based SMT (Koehn et al., 2007; Xiong et al., 2006)) is easy to integrate bilingual dictionaries (Wu et al., 2008) as long as we consider the translation lexicons of bilingual dictionaries as phrasal translation rules. Following (Wu et al., 2008), we first merge the bilingual sentence corpus Db with the bilingual dictionaries Dic, and employ the phrase-based SMT to train an SMT system called PBMT (line 1 in Algorithm 1).\nFor each rare or unknown word translation pair (Dicx, Dicy), we can easily retrieve the adequate source language monolingual sentences {(Xkp )}Kk=1 (Dicx ∈ Xkp ) from the web or other data collections. PBMT is then applied to translate {(Xkp )}Kk=1 to generate target language translations {(Y kp )}Kk=1. As PBMT employs the bilingual dictionaries Dic as additional translation rules, each target translation sentence Yp ∈ {(Y kp )}Kk=1 will contain Dicy. Then, the sentence pair (Xkp , Y k p ) will include the word translation pair (Dicx, Dicy). Finally, we can pair {(Xkp )}Kk=1 and {(Y kp )}Kk=1 to yield pseudo sentence pairs {(Xkp , Y kp )}Kk=1, which will be added into Dbp (line 2-6 in Algorithm 1).\nThe original bilingual corpusDb and the pseudo bilingual sentence pairs Dbp are combined together to train a new NMT model. Some may worry that the target parts of Dbp are SMT results but not well-formed sentences which would harm NMT training. Fortunately, Sennrich et\nal. (2015b), Cheng et al. (2016b) and Zhang and Zong (2016) observe from large-scale experiments that the synthesized bilingual data using self-learning framework can substantially improve NMT performance. Since Dbp now contains bilingual dictionaries, we expect that the NMT trained on {Db,Dbp} cannot only significantly boost the translation quality, but also solve the problem of rare word translation if they are covered by Dic.\nNote that the pseudo sentence pair synthesis model can be further augmented by the mixed word/character model to solve other OOV translations."

We can see that this model markedly improves the translation quality over the baseline attention-based NMT, although the idea behind is very simple.\nSpecifically, the system Zoph RNN-mixed, trained only on the bitext Db, achieves an average improvement of more than 1.0 BLEU point (34.19 vs 32.98) over the baseline Zoph RNN. It indicates that the mixed word/character model can alleviate the OOV translation problem to some ex-\ntent. For example, the number 31.3 is an OOV word in Chinese. The mixed model transforms this word into 〈B〉3 〈M〉1 〈M〉. 〈E〉3 and it is correctly copied into target side, yielding a correct translation 31.3. Moreover, some named entities (e.g. person name hecker) can be well translated.\nWhen adding the bilingual dictionary Dic as training data, the system Zoph RNN-mixed-dic further gets a moderate improvement of 0.51 BLEU points (34.70 vs 34.19) on average. We find that the mixed model could make use of some rare or unseen translation lexicons in NMT, as illustrated in the first two parts of Table 2. In the first part of Table 2, the English side of the translation lexicon is a frequent word (e.g. remain). The Chinese frequent character (e.g. liú) shares the most meaning of the whole word (zhùliú) and thus it could be correctly translated into remain. We are a little surprised by the examples in the second part of Table 2, since the correct English parts are all OOV words which require each English character to be correctly generated. It demonstrates that the mixed model has some ability to predict the correct character sequence. However, this mixed model fails in many scenarios. The third part in Table 2 gives some bad cases. If the first predicted character is wrong, the final word translation will be incorrect (e.g. take-owned lane vs. overtaking lane). This is the main reason why the mixed model could not obtain large improvements."

(2015a) propose an approach to use target-side monolingual data to synthesize the bitexts. They generate the synthetic bilingual data by translating the target monolingual sentences to source language sentences and retrain NMT with the mixture of original bilingual data and the synthetic parallel data. Cheng et al. (2016b) and Zhang and Zong (2016) also investigate the effect of the synthesized parallel sentences. They report that the pseudo sentence pairs synthesized using the source-side monolingual data can significantly improve the translation quality. These studies inspire us to leverage the synthesized data to incorporate the bilingual dictionaries in NMT.\nVery recently, Arthur et al. (2016) try to use discrete translation lexicons in NMT. Their approach attempts to employ the discrete translation lexicons to positively influence the probability distribution of the output words in the NMT softmax layer. However, their approach only focuses on the words that belong to the vocabulary and the outof-vocabulary (OOV) words are not considered. In contrast, we concentrated ourselves on the word translation lexicons which are rarely or never seen in the bilingual training data. It is a much tougher problem. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed models, especially the data synthesis model, can solve this problem very well."

However, it remains a challenging problem how to integrate NMT with a bilingual dictionary which mainly contains words rarely or never seen in the bilingual training data. In this paper, we propose two methods to bridge NMT and the bilingual dictionaries. The core idea behind is to design novel models that transform the bilingual dictionaries into adequate sentence pairs, so that NMT can distil latent bilingual mappings from the ample and repetitive phenomena. One method leverages a mixed word/character model and the other attempts at synthesizing parallel sentences guaranteeing massive occurrence of the translation lexicon. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods can remarkably improve the translation quality, and most of the rare words in the test sentences can obtain correct translations if they are covered by the dictionary.",
