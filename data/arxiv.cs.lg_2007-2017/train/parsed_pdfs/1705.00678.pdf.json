      "text" : "Clustering is a fundamental topic in data mining and machine learning (Peng et al. 2016). It partitions data points into different groups, such that the objects within a group are similar to one another and different from those in other groups. Various methods have been proposed over the past decades. Some well-known algorithms include k-means clustering (MacQueen 1967), spectral clustering (Ng et al. 2002), and hierarchical clustering (Johnson 1967).\nThanks to the simplicity and the effectiveness, the kmeans algorithm is widely used. However, it fails to identify arbitrarily shaped clusters. Kernel k-means (Schölkopf, Smola, and Müller 1998) has been developed to capture nonlinear structure information hidden in data sets. Kernelbased learning methods requires one to specify a kernel, which means one assumes a certain shape of the underlying\nCopyright c© 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Thus the performance of kernel-based methods are largely affected by the choice of kernel.\nSpectral clustering does a low-dimensional embedding of the similarity matrix of the data before performing k-means clustering (Ng et al. 2002). The similarity between every pair of points, as an input, leverages the manifold information in this clustering model. Thus similarity-based clustering methods usually show better performance than k-means algorithm. However, the performance of this kind of methods is largely determined by the similarity matrix (Huang, Nie, and Huang 2015). Any variations during the similarity measurement, such as metric, neighborhood size, and data scale, may lead to suboptimal performance.\nRecently, self-expression has been successfully utilized in subspace recovery (Elhamifar and Vidal 2009; Luo et al. 2011), low rank representation (Kang, Peng, and Cheng 2015b; Kang, Peng, and Cheng 2015a), and recommender systems (Kang and Cheng 2016). It represents each data point in terms of the other points. By solving an optimization problem, the similarity information is automatically learned from the data. This approach can not only reveal low-dimensional structure, but also be robust to noise and data scale (Huang, Nie, and Huang 2015)."

      "text" : "In this paper, we perform clustering built upon the idea of using samples from the data to “express itself”. Rather than local structure learning (Nie, Wang, and Huang 2014), this approach extracts the global structure of data and can be extended to kernel spaces. Unlike existing clustering algorithms that work in two separate steps, we simultaneously learn similarity matrix and cluster indicators by imposing a rank constraint on the Laplacian matrix of the learned similarity matrix. By leveraging the intrinsic interactions between learning similarity and cluster indicators, our proposed model seamlessly integrates them into a joint framework, where the result of one task is used to improve the other one. To capture the nonlinear structure information inherent in many real world data sets, we directly develop our method in a kernel space, which is well known for its ability to explore the nonlinear relation. We design an efficient algorithm to find an optimal solution to our model, and show the theoretical analysis on the connections to kernel k-means, k-means, and spectral clustering methods. ar X iv :1\n70 5.\n00 67\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\nM ay\n2 01\n7\nWhile effective, the kernel in use often has enormous influence on the performance of any kernel method. Unfortunately, the most suitable kernel for a specific task is usually unknown in advance. Exhaustive search on a user-defined pool of kernels is time-consuming and impractical when the sizes of the pool and data become large (Zeng and Cheung 2011). Thus we further propose a multiple kernel algorithm for our model. Another benefit of applying multiple kernels is that we can fully utilize information from different sources equipped with heterogeneous features (Yu et al. 2012). To alleviate the effort for kernel construction and integrating complementary information, we learn an appropriate consensus kernel from a linear combination of multiple input kernels. As a result, our joint model can simultaneously learn the similarity information, cluster indicator matrix, and the optimal combination of multiple kernels. Extensive empirical results on real-world benchmark data sets show that our method consistently outperforms other stateof-the-art methods.\nNotations. In this paper, matrices are written as upper case letters and vectors are represented by boldface lowercase letters. The i-th column and the (i, j)-th element of matrix X are denoted by Xi and xij , respectively. The `2-norm of a vector x is defined as ‖x‖2 = xT · x, where T means transpose. I denotes the identity matrix and 1 denotes a column vector with all the elements as one. Tr(·) is the trace operator. 0 ≤ Z ≤ 1 means all elements of Z are in the range [0, 1]."

      "heading" : "Clustering with Single Kernel",
      "text" : "According to the self-expressive property (Elhamifar and Vidal 2009),\nXi ≈ ∑ j Xjzij , s.t. Z T i 1 = 1, 0 ≤ zij ≤ 1, (1)\nwhere zji is the weight for j-th sample. More similar data points should receive bigger weights and the weights should be smaller for less similar points. Thus Z is also called similarity matrix, which represents the global structure of data. Note that (1) is in a similar spirit of Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) (Roweis and Saul 2000), which assumes that the data points lie on a manifold and each data point can be expressed as a linear combination of its nearest neighbors. The difference from LLE lies in the fact that we specify no neighborhood, which is automatically determined by our method.\nTo obtain Z, we solve the following problem:\nmin Z ‖X −XZ‖2F + α‖Z‖2F ,\ns.t. ZT1 = 1, 0 ≤ Z ≤ 1, (2)\nwhere the first term is to measure reconstruction error, the second term is imposed to avoid the trivial solution Z = I , and α is a trade-off parameter.\nOne drawback of (2) is that it assumes linear relations between samples. To recover the nonlinear relations between the data points, we extend (2) to kernel spaces by deploying a general kernelization framework (Zhang, Nie, and Xiang 2010). Define φ : RD → H to be a kernel mapping the\ndata samples from the input space to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space H. For X = [X1, · · · , Xn] containing n samples, the transformation is φ(X) = [φ(X1), · · · , φ(Xn)]. The kernel similarity between data samples Xi and Xj is defined through a predefined kernel as KXi,Xj =< φ(Xi), φ(Xj) >. It is easy to observe that all similarities can be computed exclusively using the kernel function and one does not need to know the transformation φ. This is known as the kernel trick and it greatly simplifies the computations in the kernel space when the kernels are precomputed. Then (2) becomes\nmin Z Tr(K − 2KZ + ZTKZ) + α‖Z‖2F s.t. ZT1 = 1, 0 ≤ Z ≤ 1. (3)\nBy solving above problem, we learn the linear sparse relations of φ(X), and thus the nonlinear relations among X . Note that (3) goes back to (2) if a linear kernel is adopted.\nIdeally, we expect that the number of connected components in Z are exactly c if the given data set X consists of c clusters (that is, Z is block diagonal with proper permutations). However, the solution Z from (3) might not satisfy this desired property. Therefore, we will add another constraint based on the following theorem (Mohar et al. 1991). Theorem 1. The multiplicity c of the eigenvalue 0 of the Laplacian matrix L of Z is equal to the number of connected components in the graph with the similarity matrix Z.\nTheorem 1 means that rank(L) = n− c if the similarity matrix Z contains exactly c connected components. Thus our new clustering model is to solve:\nmin Z Tr(K − 2KZ + ZTKZ) + α‖Z‖2F s.t. ZT1 = 1, 0 ≤ Z ≤ 1, rank(L) = n− c. (4)\nProblem (4) is not easy to tackle, since L := D − Z T+Z 2 , whereD ∈ Rn×n is a diagonal matrix with the i-th diagonal element ∑ j zij+zji\n2 , also depends on similarity matrix Z. Here L is positive semi-definite, thus σi(L) ≥ 0, where σi(L) is the i-th smallest eigenvalue of L. rank(L) = n− c is equivalent to ∑c i=1 σi(L) = 0. It is not easy to enforce this constraint because the optimization problem with a rank constraint is known to be of combinatorial complexity. To mitigate the difficulty, (Wang et al. 2015; Nie et al. 2016) incorporates the rank constraint into the objective function as a regularizer. Motivated by this consideration, we relax the constraint and reformulate our model as\nmin Z Tr(K − 2KZ + ZTKZ) + α‖Z‖2F + β c∑ i=1 σi(L)\ns.t. ZT1 = 1, 0 ≤ Z ≤ 1. (5)\nThe minimization will make the regularizer ∑c i=1 σi(L)→ 0 if β is large enough. Then the constraint rank(L) = n− c will be satisfied.\nProblem (5) is still a challenging problem because of the last term. Fortunately, it can be solved by using Ky Fan’s\nTheorem (Fan 1949), i.e.,\nc∑ i=1 σi(L) = min PTP=I Tr(PTLP ), (6)\nwhere P ∈ Rn×c is the indicator matrix. The c elements of i-th row Pi,: ∈ Rc×1 are the measure of the membership of data point Xi belonging to the c clusters. Finally, our model of twin learning for similarity and clustering with a single kernel (SCSK) is formulated as\nmin Z,P\nTr(K − 2KZ + ZTKZ) + α‖Z‖2F + βTr(PTLP ),\ns.t. ZT1 = 1, 0 ≤ Z ≤ 1, PTP = I. (7)\nBy solving (7), we directly obtain the indicator matrix P ; therefore, we do not need to perform spectral clustering any more. By alternatively updating Z and P , they can improve each other and optimize (7)."

(16)\nThe optimal solution P is obtained by the c eigenvectors of L corresponding to the c smallest eigenvalues. Generally, P can not be directly used for clustering since Z does not have exactly c connected components. To obtain the final clustering results, k-means or some other discretization procedures must be performed on P (Huang, Nie, and Huang 2013).\nIn our proposed algorithm, the similarity matrix Z is not predefined as the existing spectral clustering methods in the literature. Also, the similarity matrix Z is learned by taking account of the clustering task at hand, as opposed to the existing subspace clustering methods in the literature which only focus on learning the similarity matrix Z without considering the effect of clustering on Z (Peng et al. 2015). In our method, the graph with the learned Z will be partitioned into c connected components by using P . The optimal solution P is formed by the c eigenvectors of L, which is defined by Z, corresponding to the c smallest eigenvalues. Therefore, the proposed algorithm learns the similarity matrix Z and the cluster indicator matrix P simultaneously in a coupled way, which leads to a better result in real applications than existing spectral methods as shown in our experiments, since it learns an adaptive graph for clustering."

It is often impractical to exhaustively search for the most suitable kernel. Moreover, real world data sets are often generated from different sources along with heterogeneous features.

    "abstractText" : "Many similarity-based clustering methods work in two separate steps including similarity matrix computation and subsequent spectral clustering. However, similarity measurement is challenging because it is usually impacted by many factors, e.g., the choice of similarity metric, neighborhood size, scale of data, noise and outliers. Thus the learned similarity matrix is often not suitable, let alone optimal, for the subsequent clustering. In addition, nonlinear similarity often exists in many real world data which, however, has not been effectively considered by most existing methods. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a model to simultaneously learn cluster indicator matrix and similarity information in kernel spaces in a principled way. We show theoretical relationships to kernel k-means, k-means, and spectral clustering methods. Then, to address the practical issue of how to select the most suitable kernel for a particular clustering task, we further extend our model with a multiple kernel learning ability. With this joint model, we can automatically accomplish three subtasks of finding the best cluster indicator matrix, the most accurate similarity relations and the optimal combination of multiple kernels. By leveraging the interactions between these three subtasks in a joint framework, each subtask can be iteratively boosted by using the results of the others towards an overall optimal solution. Extensive experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Introduction Clustering is a fundamental topic in data mining and machine learning (Peng et al. 2016). It partitions data points into different groups, such that the objects within a group are similar to one another and different from those in other groups. Various methods have been proposed over the past decades. Some well-known algorithms include k-means clustering (MacQueen 1967), spectral clustering (Ng et al. 2002), and hierarchical clustering (Johnson 1967). Thanks to the simplicity and the effectiveness, the kmeans algorithm is widely used. However, it fails to identify arbitrarily shaped clusters. Kernel k-means (Schölkopf, Smola, and Müller 1998) has been developed to capture nonlinear structure information hidden in data sets. Kernelbased learning methods requires one to specify a kernel, which means one assumes a certain shape of the underlying Copyright c © 2017, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Spectral clustering does a low-dimensional embedding of the similarity matrix of the data before performing k-means clustering (Ng et al. 2002). The similarity between every pair of points, as an input, leverages the manifold information in this clustering model. Thus similarity-based clustering methods usually show better performance than k-means algorithm. However, the performance of this kind of methods is largely determined by the similarity matrix (Huang, Nie, and Huang 2015). Any variations during the similarity measurement, such as metric, neighborhood size, and data scale, may lead to suboptimal performance. Recently, self-expression has been successfully utilized in subspace recovery (Elhamifar and Vidal 2009; Luo et al. 2011), low rank representation (Kang, Peng, and Cheng 2015b; Kang, Peng, and Cheng 2015a), and recommender systems (Kang and Cheng 2016). It represents each data point in terms of the other points. By solving an optimization problem, the similarity information is automatically learned from the data. This approach can not only reveal low-dimensional structure, but also be robust to noise and data scale (Huang, Nie, and Huang 2015).",
