One of the key challenges in their use is non-convexity in simultaneous optimization of regions and region-specific models. This paper proposes novel convex region-specific linear models, which we refer to as partition-wise linear models. Our key ideas are 1) assigning linear models not to regions but to partitions (region-specifiers) and representing region-specific linear models by linear combinations of partition-specific models, and 2) optimizing regions via partition selection from a large number of given partition candidates by means of convex structured regularizations. In addition to providing initialization-free globally-optimal solutions, our convex formulation makes it possible to derive a generalization bound and to use such advanced optimization techniques as proximal methods and decomposition of the proximal maps for sparsity-inducing regularizations. Experimental results demonstrate that our partition-wise linear models perform better than or are at least competitive with state-of-the-art region-specific or locally linear models.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 31 Oct 2014 09:01:27 GMT  (477kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8675v1", "15 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["hidekazu oiwa", "ryohei fujimaki"], "accepted": true, "id": "1410.8675"}
