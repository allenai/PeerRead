      "text" : "What are the fundamental characteristics that make a person uniquely him or herself? Psychology has long tried to answer this question by deriving the latent factors that distinguish people, are relatively stable across time and populations, and predict meaningful outcomes [1, 2, 3, 4]. While several different models of human personality exist, the most dominant model is the Big 5 or Five Factor Model, in which personality characteristics generally group into five factors: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism/ emotional stability, and openness/ intellect [5, 6]. The Big 5 is meant to summarize, at a broad level, characteristic behaviors that distinguish a person throughout different contexts of their daily life. It is typically assessed through a questionnaire, in which a person reflects on their typical thoughts and behaviors [5]. Such questionnaires only indirectly capture actual behavior and also suffer from systematic response biases [7, 8].\nThe rise of big data offers opportunities to study everyday behavior at a scale never before possible. Each day, people reveal aspects of their lives through words expressed online through\nPLOS 1/21\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n08 03\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\nsocial media, such as Facebook and Twitter. Leveraging this linguistic information, we derive a trait model based on everyday linguistic behavior. Our approach analyzes the words and phrases of tens of thousands of users and their millions of messages to infer a set of traits.\nIn line with trait theory [9], we seek a small number of generalizable and stable traits that capture meaningful differences between people. We call these behavior-based linguistic traits (BLTs). Our method does not rely on any hand-crafted lexica or questionnaires and it scales well to leverage the large amount of data available on social media. While some have leveraged social media and open-vocabulary techniques to assess existing trait models — e.g., Big 5 [5] of bloggers [10] or Facebook users [11], the dark triad [12] using Facebook [13] — to the best of our knowledge, none have attempted to infer the latent traits themselves.\nWe evaluate BLTs along two criteria:\n• Generalizability: The factors need to be generalizable across a large variety of predictive tasks.\n• Stability: The factors should be relatively stable over time and populations. The factor scores of users over time should be correlated, at levels similar to cross-time and cross-population correlations of the Big 5.\nThe overall goal of this study is to determine if it is feasible to derive generalizable and stable traits from the behavior of social media language use. We produce BLTs using methods of matrix factorization. Then, we evaluate the extent to which the BLTs meet this criteria by considering their predictive validity, test-retest validity, dropout reliability, face validity, and ability to predict psychological variables (DEPRESSION SCORES) and social-demographic variables (IQ, INCOME and LIKES)."

      "text" : "Personality theory and research has a long history of finding characteristics, factors, and aspects that distinguish people from each other. Although personality has been used in a myriad of ways, much of the research can generally be classified into two purposes: (a) Identifying the major constructs and factors that consistently distinguish groups of individuals, and (b) Predictive models that either predict personality traits from other characteristics or use personality to predict other variables. We further discuss each of these themes below."

      "text" : "Personality psychologists have long sought to identify fundamental characteristics that ideographically distinguish individuals yet also adequately cluster across groups of individuals to reveal consistent patterns of behavior. While there are multiple approaches for studying individual differences, the most dominant approaches are rooted in the lexical hypothesis, which suggests that key features of human personality will become a part of the language that we use to describe ourselves [1, 4, 14]. The importance of language in psychology is underscored by [15]:\nLanguage is the most common and reliable way for people to translate their internal thoughts and emotions into a form that others can understand. Words and language, then, are the very stuff of psychology and communication.\nConsequently, a long line of work in personality psychology has sought to characterize individual differences based on words that people use. The Big 5 model arose by having people rate themselves across dictionary-based adjectives (e.g., I see myself as extraverted, enthusiastic; reserved, quiet), and then using factor analysis to group responses into a small number of factors. Early on, a lexicon of 18, 000 words that distinguish one person from another based on an English dictionary was proposed by [1]. Participants rated themselves on these characteristics,\nPLOS 2/21\nand numerous factor analyses revealed anywhere between three and 16 major factors. Other lexica and lists of adjective descriptors have also been developed and tested over the past century. Although there are some exceptions, across multiple questionnaires, cultures, and temporal periods, the Big 5 factors consistently appear [6].\nAs such, the dominant approach towards characterizing personality is based on hand-crafted lexica and dictionaries [4]. Psychologists have developed a variety of questionnaires that capture these personality traits [4, 5, 16]. People can easily reflect on their own personality, or others can provide an evaluation of that person’s personality using these questionnaires.\nThe five factors are hierarchical in nature, with the five factors underscored by aspects which are comprised of specific traits or facets, which reflect habitual behaviors, thoughts, emotions, and ways of responding to situations [17]. Personality questionnaires are meant to summarize everyday behavior, but represent a reflection based on self (or other) perceptions, rather than directly assessing everyday behavior as it occurs. Underlying characteristics better predict outcomes [18], but also are less consistent across individuals. As the Big 5 do successfully predict important life outcomes, they are useful in providing broad representations of relatively stable individual differences, at the expense of capturing behaviors that occur in everyday life.\nOther approaches to personality assessment exist. For instance, narrative approaches to personality (e.g., [19]) successfully provide rich idiographic descriptions of a person within their everyday context. However, such approaches are time and resource intensive, and thus only occur at small scale, making it a challenge to find common nomothetic constructs.\nAn initial attempt was made to use an open-ended approach to learn personality traits by extracting common themes from self-narrative texts [20]. Using a dataset of 1, 165 open-ended self-descriptive narratives, a factor analysis was performed on the most frequently used adjectives to reveal latent factors. Latent factors were shown to correlate moderately with the Big 5 factors and suggested psychologically meaningful dimensions. The current study extends this work at much larger scale."

      "text" : "Personality is interesting in part because it is predictive of meaningful life outcomes, including education and job success, social relationships, physical and mental health, and longevity (e.g., [21, 22]). Personality can also be predicted by other biological, social, psychological, and behavioral measures.\nWith recent advances in computational social science, researchers have sought to predict personality, as well as other psychosocial and demographic differences, amongst users [10, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. In this paper, we focus on work related to the description and prediction of personality from language on social media.\nMultiple studies have analyzed social media data, including Facebook posts, text messages, and Twitter tweets, finding correlates of the Big 5 and other individual characteristics with language [24, 25, 32]. Park et al. developed a language-based personality assessment based on Facebook language that predicted personality at similar levels to other methods of personality assessment [29]. Golbeck et al. proposed a method to predict personality of a user based on their posts on Twitter [26]. Sumner et al. proposed a method to predict dark personality traits, based on Twitter language [27]. Plank and Hovy analyzed 1.2 million Tweets and proposed a model to predict Myers-Briggs personality types [28].\nWhile successful, studies increasingly suggest various complexities. Iacobelli et al. analyzed bloggers and found that the best performing model combined multiple linguistic features, including stemmed bigrams and common words [10]. Notably, they also highlighted the need for more refined and complex linguistic features. Recent works show that moving beyond words and incorporating complex features like distributed sentence representations improve personality prediction [30, 31]. As a whole, studies suggest that language can predict personality, but simplistic models might fail to adequately capture the complexities of the human psyche.\nPLOS 3/21\nWhile existing studies begin with personality models as the ground truth, the current study harnesses the power of social media data to examine traits that arise from the language itself."

We filter out all users who posted less than 1000 words overall, are over 65 years of age, or who claim that they are not from the US. Additionally, we filter out all messages that are not English.\nAmong these users, 49, 139 have data on age, gender and their Big 5 personality scores (BIG5), based on 20 personality items from the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP) [34] which comprises our final data set. A few sample messages are shown below:\n• goodbye to anybody i didn’t get to chill with before i left\n• a relaxed mind mks u see things in a better shade whose existance were merely ignored\n• scars heal , glory fades and all we’re left with are the memories made\nAbout 62.8% of the users in our dataset are female. The age distribution is skewed towards younger people with the median age of 22 years and a mean age of 25.49 years. While we believe that our derived latent factors should capture various ages and genders, we also investigate residualizing out demographic factors (age and gender). All messages are tokenized and stop-words (very frequent words like “the” or “is”) are removed in the pre-processing stage."

      "heading" : "Alternative methods",
      "text" : "• Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA): We first modeled the compiled linguistic information from each user as a document and latent factors as topics. LDA [35] enables us to learn these factors (i.e., topics) that represent each person based on the corpus of the user’s text. Each user is then represented as a mixture over the learned factors. We used the MALLET [36] toolkit to learn LDA factors, set α = 5, and enabled hyper-parameter optimization. We optimize the hyper-parameters every 20 iterations with a burn-in of 10 iterations.\nHowever, the LDA factors were negatively correlated with each other. This can be explained by noting that the factor scores obtained by LDA for each user must sum to 1. This implies that LDA, a probabilistic model, is not well-suited for modeling latent factors, and that probabilistic models are not suitable for modeling traits.\nPLOS 4/21\n• Singular Value Decomposition (SVD): We next considered SVD [37]. We specified a user-set (U) and a finite set of vocabulary terms corresponding to those users (V). We constructed a term-user matrix M and computed a low-rank approximation of M using SVD.\nWhile SVD does not have the drawbacks of LDA, we observed that a more general version of dimensionality reduction, “factor analysis (FA)”, demonstrates better empirical performance on predictive tasks and motivates FA as our proposed method to capture traits. As such, our proposed methodology draws on FA, rather than LDA or SVD."
    }, {
      "heading" : "Proposed Method: Factor Analysis (FA)",
      "text" : "Factor Analysis (FA) has long been a part of psychological research and the development of psychometric assessments. The method seeks to represent a set of variables as linear combinations of a small number of latent factors. Formally, given a matrix M , factor analysis seeks to learn latent factors F and a loading matrix L such that:\nM = FL+ E (1)\nwhere E represents an error matrix. While SVD seeks to learn factors that account for all of the variance, FA is more general and learns factors that account for the common variance but allows for some residual variance not explained by the latent factors.\nTypically in psychology, factors are estimated and then rotated to find the best fitting solution. We chose to use FA as an approach to identify latent user factors. We applied FA on the User-Term matrix and investigated various rotations of the loading matrix L to obtain potentially more interpretable factors. In our final models, we used a promax (oblique) rotation with equa-max rotation for all our experiments.\nUsing factor analysis, we extracted 5 factors. We chose to extract 5 factors as a direct comparison to the Big5 model. For comparison, we also extracted 10 and 30 factors (aligning with 10 underlying aspects [17] and 30 facets [5]; results of these models are available in the Supplemental Information section. Figure 1 illustrates word clouds corresponding to the most and least correlated words for each factor (i.e., different language analysis; [11]). The factors capture emotion words such as life, heart, happiness, love (see FA:F1(+)) and non-emotion words such as week-end, school, work, tomorrow, tonight (see FA:F1(-)). These observations suggest that our factors capture a variety of behavioral and psychological cues."

      "heading" : "Differential Analysis and Convergent Validity",
      "text" : "We next explore how our derived factors relate with one another and with the BIG5, using Pearson correlation coefficients (r). If the factors are capturing real personality characteristics, they should be correlated to some extent with the personality factors that have dominated personality research. But if they capture unique variance, then correlations should only be low to moderate. They should also minimally correlate with one another. As illustrated in Figure 2, the factors most consistently correlate with extraversion and openness. F4 demonstrates the strongest correlation, reflecting lower levels of conscientiousness. The F4 words are similar to [32], with numerous swear words on the positive side and family, work, and relaxation words on the negative side [32].\nWe also report the correlation of each individual factor with outcomes which we show in Figure 3. In general, we note that each individual factor correlates slightly with outcomes but we also observe stronger correlations. Observe for example, that Factor F2 which appears to capture the behavior of teenagers correlates negatively with income. Furthermore, observe how Factor F4, which captures people who are offended (and use swear words) is negatively correlated with Satisfaction with Life (SWL).\nPLOS 5/21\nWe now show the 2 BIG5 QUESTIONS and the 5 LIKES that correlate the most positively and negatively with each individual factor in Figure 4 which reveal some insights into the human behaviors captured by our factors. To give a couple of examples, Factor F1 captures traits of people who have a rich vocabulary and like to engage in deeper conversations. Note that people with these traits also like philosophy and like DALAI LAMA, THE ALCHEMIST AND TED. On the other hand, people with a low factor F1 score are not interested in theoretical discussions, have difficulty understanding abstract ideas, and like animated movies such as FINDING DORY. Similarly note that factor F5 also captures openness and a liberal outlook, where people who have a rich vocabulary tend to vote for liberal political parties and watch/listen to NPR, PBS and THE DAILY SHOW.\nIn summary, all of these examples suggest that our learned factors capture a variety of human behavior as observed on social media, entirely derived from their language using an open vocabulary approach.\nFinally, Figure 5 illustrates the effect of rotation on the factor structure. While the un-rotated version has multiple factors that are characterized by words like “paste this” and “status update”, note the stark absence of words like “paste this” in the rotated version in multiple factors thus yielding a more distinct factor structure."

In both cases, we restrict analyses to linear models to ensure that our models are interpretable and reveal the inherent predictive power of the factors.

If the BLT factors demonstrate endurance, then we’d expect to see strong correlations on the test set (r = .60 and above) across a 6 month interval, with some declines across subsequent temporal periods.\nDropout Reliability Finally, we evaluate the external validity of the learned factors across different samples of users. The learned factors should not be overly dependent on a specific set of users from the training data.

For questionnaire-based outcomes, the BIG5 factors better predict SWL and depression than our factors. This is driven by strong correlations of SWL and depression with extraversion and neuroticism. The BIG5 also outpredicts our factors for the size of the friend network, which again is driven by strong correlations with extraversion. Notably, correlations are equivalent for the BIG5 and FA5 in predicting the additional personality questions (Big5Questions). In contrast, as highlighted in the table, our factors better predict income, IQ, and the user likes. For example, on the task of predicting LIKES, FA with 5 factors outperforms the baseline by 7 percentage points (60.11 - 52.6). It is worth emphasizing here that the task of predicting LIKES is a challenging task - it essentially involves 20 different classification tasks. Consequently, an improvement of 7 percentage points on this task is promising. Also note that adding age and gender as covariates improves predictive performance (compare FA5+DEMOG with FA5).\nPLOS 8/21\nTables 2 and 3 show the best (top) and worst (bottom) BIG5 items and LIKES, ranked according to the predictive performance by our BLTS. For BIG5 questions, BLTS best predicted openness items, and less predictive of extraversion and conscientiousness items. The strongest items focus on language (e.g., “have a rich vocabulary” (see Table 2a), suggesting that the BLTS are adequately capturing everyday behavior. For LIKES, BLTS predict general categories (e.g., music genres, children focused), and is least predictive of generic LIKEs which almost all users might like (for example: YOUTUBE, FACEBOOK).\nWe conclude by emphasizing that the traits learned using FA are not apriori tuned to any particular predictive task, and yet perform competitively with traits derived from questionnaires in predicting a variety of outcomes and even outperform questionnaire based traits on behavioral outcomes like INCOME and IQ, thus underscoring the generalizability of these traits."

Four of the five factors demonstrate strong correlations, with some decline over subsequent periods, but generally are fairly stable. The exception is F3. The words in this factor (see Figure 1) reflect Facebook behavior (e.g., paste, your status, repost) versus offline behavior (e.g., tomorrow, tonight, sleep, excited). In this case, we believe this factor is capturing less of a trait and more of a temporary “new Facebook user” state.\nFinally, for the dropout analysis we computed the mean correlation among factors obtained over multiple runs where a random sample of 20% were dropped before learning the factors. We used the Hungarian algorithm to infer the mapping between factors across multiple runs.

We see such an approach as a supplement to traditional techniques. Finally, we did not directly address interpretability of our learned factors and did not explicitly impose stability constraints (and revealed we had one more dynamic state-like factor). On the other hand, our goal has been to determine the feasibility of deriving traits from social media behavior, rather than to propose a specific set of traits, akin to the big five, to be used across all contexts.

      "text" : "We proposed a method based on factor analysis to infer latent personality traits from the everyday language of users on social media. A person is ”an organized, dynamic, agentic system functioning in the social world”, with characteristics, behaviors, feelings, and thoughts that are both consistent and variable across time and situations [41]. Individual differences have often been based on questionnaire items, which may not capture the richness of everyday human behavior.\nOur method infers latent factors from linguistic behavior in social media – a medium that allows access to large sample sizes; unprompted access to user’s thoughts, emotions, and language; and data-driven approaches. We derived five factors from the language, and demonstrated that these factors are generalizable with good predictive power, and stable across\nPLOS 10/21\ntime and sub-populations. We see this as a stepping stone to deriving a supplement to the popular Big Five personality traits based on large-scale behavioral data rather than questionnaire self-reports. We have demonstrated it is feasible to produce factors from social media language that have predictive and face validity, stability and sometimes generalize better than the Big Five.\nSupporting Information In this section, we provide supporting results based on our analyses of BLTs.

Such characteristics were derived through theory, dictionary analyses, and survey research using explicit self-reports. The availability of social media data spanning millions of users now makes it possible to automatically derive characteristics from behavioral data — language use — at large scale. Taking advantage of linguistic information available through Facebook, we study the process of inferring a new set of potential human traits based on unprompted language use. We subject these new traits to a comprehensive set of evaluations and compare them with a popular five factor model of personality. We find that our language-based trait construct is often more generalizable in that it often predicts non-questionnaire-based outcomes better than questionnaire-based traits (e.g. entities someone likes, income and intelligence quotient), while the factors remain nearly as stable as traditional factors. Our approach suggests a value in new constructs of personality derived from everyday human language use.",
