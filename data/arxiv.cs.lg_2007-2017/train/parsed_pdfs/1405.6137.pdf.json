      "text" : "102 IEEE TGRS\nThe improvements in spectral and spatial resolution of the satellite images have facilitated the automatic extraction and identification of the features from satellite images and aerial photographs. An automatic object extraction method is presented for extracting and identifying the various objects from satellite images and the accuracy of the system is verified with regard to IRS satellite images. The system is based on neural network and simulates the process of visual interpretation from remote sensing images and hence increases the efficiency of image analysis. This approach obtains the basic characteristics of the various features and the performance is enhanced by the automatic learning approach, intelligent interpretation, and intelligent interpolation. The major advantage of the method is its simplicity and that the system identifies the features not only based on pixel value but also based on the shape, haralick features etc of the objects. Further the system allows flexibility for identifying the features within the same category based on size and shape. The successful application of the system verified its effectiveness and the accuracy of the system were assessed by ground truth verification.\nKeywords: object extraction; intelligent interpolation; neural net; intelligent interpretation;"

      "text" : "The availability of high resolution images has facilitated the automatic extraction and identification of objects and is not only demanding but also a task of practical importance. Object based approach has been applied to various contexts namely map updation, classification, automatic registration, change detection, target recognition, urban planning, site modelling etc. Efficiencies of various methodologies in this context are affected by different factors such as scene complexity, feature variability, undefined feature geometry, and sensor resolution (Bruno, 1998; Lari, 2011).\nThere are a number of object extraction algorithms and most of them are specific to features to be extracted and adopts computationally complex methods for the extraction (Shuichi, 2011). Neural Network (NN) technique that models the human brain has the ability to derive meaning from complicated or imprecise data. This ability of NN is exploited to extract patterns and detect trends that are too complex to be noticed by either humans or other computer techniques. Bruno et al. (Bruno, 1998) suggested a road extraction system in which tests segments (matched filters for short road segments) was adopted to detect the road position. The method was not completely automatic since starting point and direction was to be provided. Barzohar et al (1996) discussed a road extraction system which linkers, correlation trackers, and region based followers for detection. Road tracing based on profile matching and kalman filtering was introduced by Vosselman et al (1995) how ever seemed to be noise sensitive especially in case of small distances between the profiles. Model based road extraction from images proposed by Carsten (1998) also failed due to the lack of topology consideration as well as context. A semiautomatic feature extraction based on snakes was suggested by John et al (1986) however the method needs manual involvement and the snakes seems to get distorted in the proximity of other features in the image. Gruen (1997) suggested a road extraction method based on wavelet transformed image and least square matching but seemed to be less\n103 IEEE TGRS\nproposed by Quint et al (1995) but the efficiency was limited by the mere use of line segments for image analysis and accuracy was dependent on the availability of the map at hand.\nWang et al (2009) proposed a fuzzy mask based method in order to perform road pixels extraction in which a road membership value is attributed to each pixel. Lau Bee Theng et al (2008), in his methods adopted active contour model to extract objects like land parcels and buildings from high resolution satellite imageries. A technique that integrates the advantages of both fuzzy theory and Hopfield type neural network for object extraction from noisy background was proposed by Bhattacharyya et al (1998). Many approaches based on neural networks for road detection did not achieve significant improvements as they relied on a small context (9×9 pixels being the largest) for prediction and used very little training data (Boggess, 1993). An automatic road extraction system using a neural network with millions of trainable weights was suggested by Mnih et al (2010) how ever considered only pixel values as parameter for the extraction.\nMost of the errors in the current systems are due to the ambiguous nature of the labelling task. Porway et al. (2008) used a grammar to model relationships between objects such as cars, trees, and roofs for the purpose of parsing aerial images. An object extraction method was proposed Jiangye Yuan et al(2009) based on locally excitatory globally inhibitory oscillator networks (LEGION) in which oscillation network can segment the image and extract objects by the scene and object feature. A knowledge-based method for automatic road extraction from high resolution remotely sensed images was proposed by Trinder et al (2003). They described road structures as a generalized anti parallel pair and their radiometric and geometric properties are expressed as rules in Prolog by virtue of which the extraction was accomplished. But this method was based on the static learning approach, ie system was unable to update the set of properties for road as a new one is encountered.\nIn this paper we propose a neural network based method for feature extraction which can extract the various features in to separate layers. The adoption of neural network for the feature extraction has many added advantages as error tolerance, non-linear programming, facility for training etc. as compared to the other approaches .The method can be effectively used for the various GIS systems as that used for planning and other purposes. The system automates the image analysis and simulates the visual interpretation of images along with enhancing the process with speed, simplicity, accuracy, intelligent interpretation and automatic interpolation. The system as implemented in mat lab is computationally simple and faster than its back propagation based counter parts implemented in c and other languages. The method is distinguishable from the existing methods which are based on the neural net due to the fact that it takes in to account the shape, haralick features of the objects in addition to its pixel value and also it uses back propagation which is more reliable than other training methods. The method also provides intelligent interpolation and intelligent interpretation which enhance its capability to detect objects accurately.\nOur objective is to suggest a neural network based method for the automatic extraction of features from remotely sensed images after taking in to consideration various factors as shape, pixel intensity, context etc of the feature for its extraction. The system should also provide intelligent interpolation in the sense that it should be able to remove the breaks, gaps etc. in the features also it should provide intelligent interpretation when the features are ambiguous. In this paper we propose a system based on feed forward neural net trained by back propagation algorithm. The haralick texture factors are also considered for detection and system has a rule set stored in prolog DB.\n104 IEEE TGRS"

The images are first subjected to contrast adjustment by adjusting the histogram and the edges are detected by canny edge detection operator to detect the boundaries of various common features and in case of bright features erosion followed by dilation is applied .The processed image is then fed to the trained neural net to extract or to select the features and the selected features are again subjected to curve fitting. The features outside the required boundary are eliminated by setting the pixel as black. The Haralick's texture features are also sued along with the pixel value and shape to identify the features .The haralick features include Energy, Correlation, Inertia, Entropy, Inverse Difference Moment, Sum Average, Sum Variance, Sum Entropy, Difference Average, Difference Variance, Difference Entropy, Information measure of correlation 1 and correlation 2.The extraction of specific features is done by using SOM networks and prolog rule set. The system uses a set of rules stored in a prolog data base for interpreting ambiguous features and identifying them. The process is summarised schematically in fig.1.\nFig.1.

    "abstractText" : "ABSTRACT The improvements in spectral and spatial resolution of the satellite images have facilitated the automatic extraction and identification of the features from satellite images and aerial photographs. An automatic object extraction method is presented for extracting and identifying the various objects from satellite images and the accuracy of the system is verified with regard to IRS satellite images. The system is based on neural network and simulates the process of visual interpretation from remote sensing images and hence increases the efficiency of image analysis. This approach obtains the basic characteristics of the various features and the performance is enhanced by the automatic learning approach, intelligent interpretation, and intelligent interpolation. The major advantage of the method is its simplicity and that the system identifies the features not only based on pixel value but also based on the shape, haralick features etc of the objects. Further the system allows flexibility for identifying the features within the same category based on size and shape. The successful application of the system verified its effectiveness and the accuracy of the system were assessed by ground truth verification.",
