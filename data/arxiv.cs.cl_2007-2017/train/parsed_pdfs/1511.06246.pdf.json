      "text" : "Distributed word representation has been studied for a considerable efforts (Bengio et al. 2003; Morin and Bengio 2005; Bengio et al. 2006; Mnih and Hinton 2007; Mikolov et al. 2010; Turian, Ratinov, and Bengio 2010; Reisinger and Mooney 2010; Huang et al. 2012; Mikolov et al. 2013a; 2013b). By representing a word in the embedded space, it could address the problem of curse of dimensionality and capture syntactic and semantic properties. In the embedded space, words that have similar syntactic and semantic roles are also close with each other. Thus, distributed word representation is applied to a abundant natural language processing (NLP) tasks (Collobert and Weston 2008; Collobert et al. 2011; Socher et al. 2011; 2013).\nMost of previous models map a word as a single point vector in the embedded space, which surfer from polysemy problems. Concretely, many words have different senses in different contextual surroundings. For instance, word “apple” could mean a kind of fruit when the contextual information implies that the topic of the text is about food. At the meanwhile, the word “apple” could represent the Apple Inc. when the context is about information technology. To\n∗ Corresponding author.\naddress this problem, previous works have gained great success in representing multiple word prototypes. Reisinger and Mooney (2010) constructs multiple high-dimensional vectors for each word. Huang et al. (2012) learns multiple dense embeddings for each word using global document context. Neelakantan et al. (2014) proposed multi-sense skip-gram (MSSG) to learn word sense embeddings with online word sense discrimination. Most of previous works are trying to use multiple points to represent the multiple senses of words, which lead to a drawback. It cannot reflect the rich relations between words by simply representing words as points in the embedded space. For instance, we cannot infer that the word “fruit” is the hypernym of the word “apple” by representing these two words as two point vectors in the embedded space.\nIn this paper, we propose the Gaussian mixture skip-gram (GMSG) model inspired by Vilnis and McCallum (2014), who maps a word as a gaussian distribution instead of a point vector in the embedded space. GMSG model represents each word as a gaussian mixture distribution in the embedded space. Each gaussian component can be regarded as a sense of a word. Figure 1 gives an illustration of Gaussian mixture embeddings. In this way, much richer relations can be reflected via the relation of two gaussian distributions. For instance, if the word “fruit” has larger variance than the word “apple”, it could show that the word “fruit” is the hypernym of the word “apple”. In addition, using different distance metrics, the relations between words vary. The pair (apple, pear) might be much closer when we use Euclidean distance, while the pair (apple, fruit) might be much\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n06 24\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n9 N\nov 2\n01 5\ncloser when we measure them using KL divergence. Further, since the number of senses varies from word to word, we propose the Dynamic GMSG (D-GMSG) model to handle the varying sense number. D-GMSG automatically increases the sense numbers of words during training. Experiments on four benchmarks show the effectiveness of our proposed models."

Correspondingly, each context word cw also has a distributed representation vector êcw ∈ C, where C ∈ R|V |∗d is another distinguished space.\nThe skip-gram aims to maximize the probability of the co-occurrence of a word w and its context word cw, which can be formalized as:\nv(w|cw) = ∏\nu∈{w} ⋃ NEG(w) p(u|cw), (1)\nwhere function NEG(·) returns a set of negative sampling context words and p(u|cw) can be formalized as:\np(u|cw) = [σ(e>w êu)]1{u=cw}[1− σ(e>w êu)]1{u6=cw}, (2)\nwhere 1{·} is a indicator function and σ(·) is the sigmoid function.\nGiven a training corpus D which insists of (word, context) pairs (w, cw) ∈ D, the goal of skipgram model is to maximize the objective function:\nJ(θ) = ∑\n(w,cw)∈D\nlogv(w|cw), (3)\nwhere θ is the parameter set of the model. Concretely, the NEG(w) function samples negative contextual words for current word w drawn on the distribution:\nP (w) ∝ Punigram(w)sr, (4)\nwhere Punigram(w) is a unigram distribution of words and sr is a hyper-parameter."

Unlike the definition of skip-gram model, in this paper, we argue that a word can be regarded as a function. The similarity between two function f and g can be formalized as:\nsim(f, g) = ∫ x∈Rn f(x)g(x)dx (5)\nSpecifically, when we choose the gaussian distribution as the function,\nf(x) = N (x;µα,Σα), (6) g(x) = N (x;µβ ,Σβ), (7)\nthe similarity between two gaussian distributions f and g can be formalized as:\nsim(f, g) = ∫ x∈Rn N (x;µα,Σα)N (x;µβ ,Σβ)dx (8)\n= N (0;µα − µα,Σβ + Σβ), (9)\nwhere µα, µβ and Σα, Σβ are the mean and covariance matrix of word f and word g respectively.\nIn this way, we can use KL divergence to measure the distance of two words which are represented as distributions. Since KL divergence is not symmetric metric, Gaussian skip-gram (GSG) model (Figure 2b) (Vilnis and McCallum 2014) could measure the distance between words asymmetrically."

GMSG regard each word as a gaussian mixture distribution. Each component of the gaussian mixture distribution of a word can be regarded as a sense of the word. The senses are automatically learned during training using the information of occurrences of words and their context. Besides handling the polysemy problem, GMSG also captures the richer relations between words. As shown in Figure 1, it is tricky to tell whose distance is smaller between word pairs (apple, fruit) and (apple, pear). On the one hand, word “apple” seems much closer with word “fruit”, in a manner, since apple is a kind of fruit while “pear” and “apple” are just syntagmatic relation. On the other hand, word “apple” seems much closer with word “pear”, since they are in the same level of semantic granularity. Actually, in different distance metrics, the relations between words varies. The pair (apple, pear) might be much closer when we use Euclidean distance, while the pair (apple, fruit) might be much closer when we measure them using KL divergence. However, whatever the relationship between them are, their representations are learned and fixed.\nFormally, we define the distributions of two words as f and g:\nf(x) = N (x;φα, µα,Σα), (10) g(x) = N (x;φβ , µβ ,Σβ), (11)\nwhere φα and φβ are the parameters of multinomial distributions.\nThe similarity of two distributions can be formalized as:\nsim(f, g) = ∫ x∈Rn N (x;φα, µα,Σα)N (x;φβ , µβ ,Σβ)dx\n(12)\n= ∫ x∈Rn [∑ i N (x|z = i;µα,Σα)M(z = i;φα) ] ×\n(13)∑ j N (x|z = j;µβ ,Σβ)M(z = i;φβ)  dx (14) =\n∫ x∈Rn [∑ i N (x;µαi,Σαi)φαi) ] × (15)∑\nj\nN (x;µβj ,Σβj)φβj)  dx (16) =\n∑ i ∑ j φαiφβj ∫ x∈Rn N (x;µαi,Σαi)N (x;µβj ,Σβj)dx\n(17) = ∑ i ∑ j φαiφβjN (0;µαi − µβj ,Σαi + Σβj), (18)\nwhereM represents multinomial distribution.

Actually, the number of word senses varies from word to word. To dynamically increasing the numbers of gaussian components of words, we propose the Dynamic Gaussian Mixture Skip-Gram (D-GMSG) model (Figure 2d). The number of senses for a word is unknown and is automatically learned during training.\nAt the beginning, each word is assigned a random gaussian distribution.

In this paper, we use a more complex similarity function, which defines a absolute value for each positive and negative pair rather than a relative relation. Thus, we minimise a different max-margin based loss function L(θ) following (Joachims 2002) and (Weston, Bengio, and Usunier 2011):\nL(θ) = 1\nZ ∑ (w,cw)∈D ∑ c−∈NEG(w) l(θ) + 1 2 λ‖θ‖22,\nl(θ) = max{0, κ− sim(fw, fcw ) + sim(fw, fc−)}, (24)\nwhere θ is the parameter set of our model and the margin κ is a hyper-parameter. Z = ∑ (w,cw)∈D |NEG(w)| is a normalization term. Conventionally, we add a L2 regularization term for all parameters, weighted by a hyper-parameter λ.\nSince the objective function is not differentiable due to the hinge loss, we use the sub-gradient method (Duchi, Hazan, and Singer 2011). Thus, the subgradient of Eq. 24 is:\n∂L(θ)\n∂θ =\n1\nZ ∑ (w,cw)∈D ∑ c−∈NEG(w) ∂l(θ) ∂θ + λθ,\n∂l(θ) ∂θ = −∂sim(fw, fcw) ∂θ + ∂sim(fw, fc−) ∂θ .\n(25)\nIn addition, the covariance matrices need to be kept positive definite.

(2003) applies the neural network to sentence modelling instead of using n-gram language models. Since the Bengio et al. (2003) model need expensive computational resource. Lots of works are trying to optimize it. Mikolov et al.

By representing a word as a distributed vector, we gain a\nlot of interesting properties, such as similar words in syntactic or semantic roles are also close with each other in the embedded space in cosine distance or Euclidian distance. In addition, word embeddings also perform excellently in analogy tasks. For instance, eking − equeen ≈ eman − ewoman.\nHowever, previous models mainly suffer from the polysemy problem. To address this problem, Reisinger and Mooney (2010) represents words by constructing multiple sparse, high-dimensional vectors. Huang et al. (2012) is an neural network based approach, which learns multiple dense, low-dimensional embeddings using global document context. Tian et al. (2014) modeled the word polysemy from a probabilistic perspective and integrate it with the highly efficient continuous Skip-Gram model. Neelakantan et al. (2014) proposed Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (MSSG) to learn word sense embeddings with online word sense discrimination. These models perform word sense discrimination by clustering context of words. Liu et al. (2015) discriminates word sense by introducing latent topic model to globally cluster the words into different topics. Liu, Qiu, and Huang (2015) further extended this work to model the complicated interactions of word embedding and its corresponding topic embedding by incorporating the tensor method.\nAlmost previous works are trying to use multiple points to represent the multiple senses of words. However, it cannot reflect the rich relations between words by simply representing words as points in the embedded space. Vilnis and McCallum (2014) represented a word as a gaussian distribution. Gaussian mixture skip-gram (GMSG) model represents a word as a gaussian mixture distribution. Each sense of a word can be regarded as a gaussian component of the word. GMSG model gives different relations of words under different distance metrics, such as cosine distance, dot product, Euclidian distance KL divergence, etc."

      "context" : "Bengio et al. (2003) applies the neural network to sentence modelling instead of using n-gram language models. Since the Bengio et al. (2003) model need expensive computational resource. Lots of works are trying to optimize it. Mikolov et al. (2013a) proposed the skip-gram model which is extremely efficient by removing the hidden layers of the neural networks, so that larger corpus could be used to train the word representation. By representing a word as a distributed vector, we gain a lot of interesting properties, such as similar words in syntactic or semantic roles are also close with each other in the embedded space in cosine distance or Euclidian distance. In addition, word embeddings also perform excellently in analogy tasks. For instance, eking − equeen ≈ eman − ewoman. However, previous models mainly suffer from the polysemy problem. To address this problem, Reisinger and Mooney (2010) represents words by constructing multiple sparse, high-dimensional vectors. Huang et al. (2012) is an neural network based approach, which learns multiple dense, low-dimensional embeddings using global document context. Tian et al. (2014) modeled the word polysemy from a probabilistic perspective and integrate it with the highly efficient continuous Skip-Gram model. Neelakantan et al. (2014) proposed Multi-Sense Skip-Gram (MSSG) to learn word sense embeddings with online word sense discrimination. These models perform word sense discrimination by clustering context of words. Liu et al. (2015) discriminates word sense by introducing latent topic model to globally cluster the words into different topics. Liu, Qiu, and Huang (2015) further extended this work to model the complicated interactions of word embedding and its corresponding topic embedding by incorporating the tensor method. Almost previous works are trying to use multiple points to represent the multiple senses of words. However, it cannot reflect the rich relations between words by simply representing words as points in the embedded space. Vilnis and McCallum (2014) represented a word as a gaussian distribution.",

    "abstractText" : "Recently, word representation has been increasingly focused on for its excellent properties in representing the word semantics. Previous works mainly suffer from the problem of polysemy phenomenon. To address this problem, most of previous models represent words as multiple distributed vectors. However, it cannot reflect the rich relations between words by representing words as points in the embedded space. In this paper, we propose the Gaussian mixture skip-gram (GMSG) model to learn the Gaussian mixture embeddings for words based on skip-gram framework. Each word can be regarded as a gaussian mixture distribution in the embedded space, and each gaussian component represents a word sense. Since the number of senses varies from word to word, we further propose the Dynamic GMSG (D-GMSG) model by adaptively increasing the sense number of words during training. Experiments on four benchmarks show the effectiveness of our proposed model.",
