      "text" : "There has been a substantial recent interest in deep generative models. Broadly speaking, generative models can be classified into explicit models where we have access to the model likelihood function, and implicit models which provide a sampling mechanism for generating data, but do not need to explicitly define a likelihood function. Examples of explicit models are variational auto-encoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014) and PixelCNN (Oord et al., 2016). Examples of implicit generative models are generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and stochastic simulator models. Explicit models are typically trained by maximizing the likelihood or its lower bound; they are popular in probabilistic modeling as the training procedure optimizes a well-defined quantity and the likelihood can be used for model comparison and selection. However likelihood is not about human perception (Theis et al., 2015).\nRecently, GAN-based training has emerged as a promising approach for learning implicit generative models. In particular, generators trained using GAN-based approaches have shown to be capable of generating photo-realistic samples. There is a lot of interest in understanding the the properties of the learned generators in GANs and comparing them with traditional likelihood-based methods.

The generator is a real NVP with multiple invertible transformations.\nin this direction was the quantitative analysis by Wu et al. (2016) who evaluate the (approximate) likelihood of decoder based models using annealed importance sampling (AIS). We use a different approach to provide additional insights. We use a tractable generator architecture for which the log-probability densities can be computed exactly. We train the generator architecture by maximum likelihood and we also train the same generator architecture by GAN. We then compare the properties of the learned generators.\nConcretely, we use real non-volume preserving transformation (real NVP) (Dinh et al., 2016) as the generator. We compare training by maximum likelihood to training by Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) (Arjovsky et al., 2017). In WGAN, a critic learns to approximate the Wasserstein distance between the data and the generator distribution. The generator learns to minimize the critic’s approximation of the Wasserstein distance. WGAN has a well defined training procedure and allowed us to train a non-traditional GAN generator. Another advantage of WGAN is that the critic’s approximation of the Wasserstein distance can be used to detect overfitting as well as to compare different models. We discuss this more in Section 3.5.\nWGAN worked for us better than other GAN methods (Jensen-Shannon divergence or − logD(x)). We intend to communicate the found interesting differences from training by maximum likelihood. After describing the generator and the critic in Section 2, we report some perhaps surprising findings in Section 3:\n1. Generators trained by WGAN produce more globally coherent samples even from a relatively shallow gen-\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n05 26\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n5 M\nay 2\n01 7\nerator.\n2. Minimization of the approximate Wasserstein distance does not correspond to minimization of the negative log-probability density. The negative log-probability densities became worse than densities from a uniform distribution.\nWe also report a few findings about the approximate Wasserstein distance:\n1. An approximation of the Wasserstein distance ranked correctly generators trained by maximum likelihood.\n2. The approximate Wasserstein distance between the training data and the generator distribution became smaller than the distance between the test data and the generator distribution. This overfitting was observed for generators trained by maximum likelihood and also for generators trained by WGAN.\nFinally, we use the ability to compare different models when evaluating a novel fast learning critic in Section 4."

      "text" : "In all our experiments, the generator is a real-valued non-volume preserving transformation (NVP) (Dinh et al.,\n2016). The generator is schematically represented in Figure 1. The generator starts with latent noise z0 from the standard normal distribution. The noise is transformed by a sequence of invertible transformations to a generated image z1. Like other generators used in GANs, the generator does not add independent noise to the generated image.\nUnlike other GAN generators, we are able to compute the log-probability density of the generated image z1 by:\nlog pZ1(z1) = log pZ0(z0)− log |det ∂z1 ∂z0 | (1)\nwhere log pZ0(z0) is the log-probability density of the standard normal distribution. The determinant of the ∂z1∂z0 Jacobian matrix can be computed efficiently, if each transformation has a triangular Jacobian (Dinh et al., 2016).\nWe can also compute the log-probability density assigned to an image by running the inverse of the transformations. The inferred z0 can be then plugged to Equation 1.\nWe use a generator with the convolutional multi-scale architecture designed by Dinh et al. (2016). Concretely, we use 3 different generator architectures with 1, 2 and 3 multiscale levels. In figures, these generators are labeled NVP1, NVP2, NVP3 and have 7, 13 and 19 non-volume preserving transformations. Each transformation uses 4 residual blocks. In total, the generator NVP3 has 19 × 4 = 76 layers. It is a very deep generator. To have the same training and testing conditions, we use no batch normalization in the generator."

      "text" : "Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) (Arjovsky et al., 2017) uses a critic instead of a discriminator. The critic is trained to provide an approximation of the Wasserstein distance between the real data distribution Pr and the generator distribution Pg . The approximation is based on the KantorovichRubinstein duality:\nW (Pr , Pg) ∝ max f Ex∼Pr [f(x)]− Ex∼Pg [f(x)] (2)\nwhere f : RD → R is a Lipschitz continuous function. In practice, the critic f is a neural network with clipped weights to have bounded derivatives. The critic is trained to produce high values at real samples and low values at generated samples. The difference of the expected critic values then approximates the Wasserstein distance. The approximation is scaled by the Lipschitz constant for the critic (Arjovsky et al., 2017). After training the critic for the current generator distribution, the generator can be trained to minimize the approximate Wasserstein distance.\nWe follow closely the original WGAN implementation1 and use a DCGAN (Radford et al., 2015) based critic. The implementation uses learning rate 0.00005, batch size 64 and clips the critic weights to a fixed box [−0.01, 0.01]. The critic is updated 100 times in the first 25 generator steps and also after every 500 generator steps, otherwise the critic is updated 5 times per generator step.\n1https://github.com/martinarjovsky/ WassersteinGAN\nWe rescale the images to [−1, 1] range before feeding them to the critic."

The computed log-probability density will be then a lower bound for the log-probability mass (Theis et al., 2015):\n∫ [0,1]D log p(x+ u) du ≤ log ∫ [0,1]D p(x+ u) du (3)\nFinally, before feeding the pixel intensities to a network, we divide the pixel intensities by 256. This is a simple nonvolume preserving transformation. If the noisy image is z2 = x+u and the image with scaled intensities is z1 = z2256\nthen the log-probability density of the noisy image is:\nlog pZ2(z2) = log pZ1(z1)− log |det ∂z2 ∂z1 | (4)\n= log pZ1(z1)−D log 256 (5)\nwhere D is the number of dimensions in the image (e.g., D = 32 × 32 × 3). For example, if an uninformed model assigns uniform probability density pZ1(z1) = 1 to all z1 ∈ [0, 1]D, the model would require log2(256) = 8 bits/dim to describe an image. The reported negative logprobability density then corresponds to an upper bound on compression loss in bits/dim."

      "text" : "Figure 4 shows the negative log-probability density for generators trained by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). The shallowest generator NVP1 obtained the worse performance there. The generators show only a small amount of overfitting to the training set. The validation loss is slightly higher than the training loss.\nGenerators trained by WGAN have their negative logprobability densities shown in Figure 5. The figure has a completely different y-axis. The negative log-probability densities get worse when training by WGAN. The training and validation losses overlap.\nA generator can get infinite negative log-probability if it assigns zero probability to an example. To check this possibility, we analysed the negative log-probabilities assigned to all validation examples. Figure 6 shows the histogram of negative log-probabilities. We see that all 19867 validation examples have low log-probabilities. A similar histogram was obtained also for the training set. So the bad average log-probability is not caused by a single outlier.\nWe further inspected the negative log-probability density of generated samples. We observed that the average negative log-probability density of generated samples is -1.12 bits/dim. The negative sign is not a typo. The negative log-probability density can be negative, if the probability density is bigger than 1. In contrast, the NVP3 generator trained by maximum likelihood assigned on average 4.27 bits/dim to the validation examples and 4.35 bits/dim to its own generated samples.\nThe problematic negative log-probability densities from WGAN were not limited to the CelebA dataset. Generators trained by WGAN had high negative log-probability densities also on MNIST (Figure 13). A deep generator trained by WGAN learns a distribution lying on a low dimensional manifold (Figure 17 in the appendix). The generator is then putting the probability mass only to a space with a near-zero volume. We may need a more powerful critic to recognize the excessively correlated pixels. Approximating the likelihood by annealed importance sampling (Wu et al., 2016) would not discover this problem, as their analysis assumes a Gaussian observation model with a fixed variance.\nThe problem is not unique to WGAN. We also obtained near-infinite negative log-probability densities when training GAN to minimize the Jensen-Shannon divergence (Goodfellow et al., 2014)."

We know that the distribution of the latent variables is the prior N(0, 1), if the given images are from the generator. We are curious to see the distribution of the latent variables, if the given images are from the validation set.\nIn Figure 7, we display a 2D histogram of the first 2 latent variables z0[1], z0[2]. The histogram was obtained by inferring the latent variables for all examples from the validation set. When the generator was trained by maxi-\nmum likelihood, the inferred latent variables had the following means and standard deviations: µ1 = 0.05, µ2 = 0.05, σ1 = 1.06, σ2 = 1.03. In contrast, the generator trained by WGAN had inferred latent variables with significantly larger standard deviations: µ1 = 0.02, µ2 = 1.62, σ1 = 3.95, σ2 = 8.96.\nWhen generating the latent variables from the N(0, 1) prior, the samples from the generator trained by WGAN would have a different distribution than the validation set."

(2016) and Dinh et al. (2016) visualized ‘conceptual compression’ by inferring the latent variables and then resampling a part of the latent variables from the normalN(0, 1) prior. The subsequent reconstruction should still form a valid image. If the original image was generated by the generator, the partially resampled latent vector would still have the normal N(0, 1) distribution.\nFigure 8 shows the reconstructions if resampling the first half or the second half of the latent vector. The generator trained by maximum likelihood (MLE) has partial reconstructions similar to generated samples. In comparison,\nthe partial reconstructions from the generator trained by WGAN do not resemble samples from WGAN. This again indicates that the validation examples have a different distribution than WGAN samples."

      "heading" : "3.5. Wasserstein Distance",
      "text" : "We will now look at the approximate Wasserstein distance between the validation data and the generator distribution. To approximate the Wasserstein distance, we will use the duality in Equation 2. We will train another critic to assign high values to validation samples and low values to generated samples. This independent critic will be used only for evaluation. The generator will not see the gradients from the independent critic.\nThe independent critic is trained to maximize:\nŴ (xvalid , xg) = 1\nN N∑ i=1 f̂(xvalid [i])− 1 N N∑ i=1 f̂(xg[i]))\n(6)\nwhere xvalid is a batch of samples from the validation set, xg is a batch of generated samples and f̂ is the independent critic.\nWe will keep the Lipschitz constant of the independent critic approximately constant by always using same architecture and the same weight clipping for the independent critic. We can then compare the approximate Wasserstein distances from different experiments.\nFigure 9-left shows the approximate Wasserstein distance between the validation set and the generator distribution. The first thing to notice is the correct ordering of generators trained by maximum likelihood. The deepest generator NVP3 has the smallest approximate distance from the validation set, as indicated by the thick solid lines.\nWe also display an approximate distance between the training set and generator distribution:\nŴ (xtrain , xg) (7)\nand the approximate distance between the test set and the generator distribution:\nŴ (xtest , xg) (8)\nwhere xtrain is a batch of training examples, xtest is a batch of test examples and Ŵ is the approximate Wasserstein distance computed by Equation 6. We are misusing the independent critic here. We are asking the independent critic to assign values to training and test examples. The independent critic was trained only to assign values to validation examples and to generated samples. This leads to a desirable effect: We can detect whether the generator overfits the training data. If the training examples have the same distribution as the test examples, we should observe:\nE [ Ŵ (xtrain , xg) ] = E [ Ŵ (xtest , xg) ] (9)\nIn practice, the empirical distribution of the training data is not the same as the distribution of the test data. The generated samples xg can be more similar to the training data than to the test data.\nFigure 9 clearly shows that:\nŴ (xtrain , xg) < Ŵ (xtest , xg) (10)\nfor the trained generators. The approximate distance between the test set and the generator distribution is a little bit smaller than the approximate distance between the validation set and the generator distribution. The approximate distance between the training set and the generator distribution is much smaller. The generators are overfitting the training set.\nAlgorithm 1 Fast Learning Critic Require: batch size N , conditional critic f . Sample xr ∼ Pr a batch from the real data. Sample xg ∼ Pg a batch of generator samples. Sample xe ∼ Pg extra generator samples. Compute the approximate Wasserstein distance: W := 1N ∑N i=1 f(xr[i], xe)− 1N ∑N i=1 f(xg[i], xe)\nIn multiple experiments, we found that the performance of the generators is heavily influenced by the WGAN critic used for training. Figure 9-right shows that Ŵ (xvalid , xg) is roughly the same for NVP1 and NVP3 (blue and red thick solid lines). Both generators were trained with the same WGAN critic architecture. The generators can also overfit and gradually degrade the performance on the validation set. Visual inspection of the samples can be then misleading.\nThe approximate Wasserstein distance introduced by Arjovsky et al. (2017) is a very useful tool for model selection. If we use the independent critic, we can compare generators trained by other GAN methods or by different approaches. MNIST results are in Figure 14. In the next section, we will use the independent critic to compare different critic architectures."

The moments can be then passed as extra information to the critic. We will do something more powerful. We will allow the critic to extract features from the extra generator samples.\nConcretely, we will allow the critic to condition on the extra samples from the generator.

Second, we used an independent critic to compare the approximate Wasserstein distances on the validation set. The independent critic is very generic. The critic only needs samples from two distributions.\nThe approximate Wasserstein distance from the independent critic allows us to compare different generator and critic architectures. If we care about Wasserstein distances, we should be comparing generators based on the approximate Wasserstein distance to the validation set.\nThe log-probability densities are less useful for generator comparison when the generators are generating only a subset of the data. On the other hand, when doing lossless compression, we care about log-probabilities (Theis et al., 2015). When using real NVPs we can even jointly optimize both objectives (Figure 15 and Figure 16).\nWe show one additional usage of real NVPs for Adversarial Variational Bayes (Mescheder et al., 2017) evaluation in the appendix."

The discriminator would need to output logit(D(x)) = −KL to represent the KL.\nAfter measuring the problem, we can start thinking how to mitigate it. It would be possible to use auto-regressive discriminators (Oord et al., 2016) to decompose the large KL divergence to multiple smaller terms:\nlog q(z|x) p(z) = ∑ i log q(zi|x, z1:i−1)− log p(zi) (11)\nwhere p(zi) is the independent Gaussian prior."
