      "text" : "Automatic summarization is the process of automatically generating a summary that retains the most important content of the original text document (Edmundson, 1969; Luhn, 1958; Nenkova and McKeown, 2012). Different from the common extraction-based and compression-based methods, abstraction-based methods aim at constructing new sentences as summaries, thus they require a deeper understanding of the text and the capability of generating new sentences, which provide an obvious advantage in improving the focus of a summary, reducing the redundancy, and keeping a good compression rate (Bing et al., 2015; Rush et al., 2015; Nallapati et al., 2016).\n∗The work described in this paper is supported by a grant from the Grant Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China (Project Code: 14203414).\nSome previous research works show that human-written summaries are more abstractive (Jing and McKeown, 2000). Moreover, our investigation reveals that people may naturally follow some inherent structures when they write the abstractive summaries. To illustrate this observation, we show some examples in Figure 1, which are some top story summaries or headlines from the channel “Technology” of CNN. After analyzing the summaries carefully, we can find some common structures from them, such as “What”, “What-Happened” , “Who Action What”, etc. For example, the summary “Apple sues Qualcomm for nearly $1 billion” can be structuralized as “Who (Apple) Action (sues) What (Qualcomm)”. Similarly, the summaries “[Twitter] [fixes] [botched @POTUS account transfer]”, “[Uber] [to pay] [$20 million] for misleading drivers”, and “[Bipartisan bill] aims to [reform] [H-1B visa system]” also follow the structure of “Who Action What”. The summary “The emergence of the ‘cyber cold war”’ matches with the structure of “What”, and the summary “St. Louis’ public library computers hacked” follows ar X iv :1 70 8. 00 62\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\nA ug\n2 01\n7\nthe structure of “What-Happened”.\nIntuitively, if we can incorporate the latent structure information of summaries into the abstractive summarization model, it will improve the quality of the generated summaries. However, very few existing works specifically consider the latent structure information of summaries in their summarization models. Although a very popular neural network based sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) framework has been proposed to tackle the abstractive summarization problem (Lopyrev, 2015; Rush et al., 2015; Nallapati et al., 2016), the calculation of the internal decoding states is entirely deterministic. The deterministic transformations in these discriminative models lead to limitations on the representation ability of the latent structure information. Miao and Blunsom (2016) extended the seq2seq framework and proposed a generative model to capture the latent summary information, but they did not consider the recurrent dependencies in their generative model leading to limited representation ability.\nTo tackle the above mentioned problems, we design a new framework based on sequenceto-sequence oriented encoder-decoder model equipped with a latent structure modeling component. We employ Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) (Kingma and Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014) as the base model for our generative framework which can handle the inference problem associated with complex generative modeling. However, the standard framework of VAEs is not designed for sequence modeling related tasks. Inspired by (Chung et al., 2015), we add historical dependencies on the latent variables of VAEs and propose a deep recurrent generative decoder (DRGD) for latent structure modeling. Then the standard discriminative deterministic decoder and the recurrent generative decoder are integrated into a unified decoding framework. The target summaries will be decoded based on both the discriminative deterministic variables and the generative latent structural information. All the neural parameters are learned by back-propagation in an end-to-end training paradigm.\nThe main contributions of our framework are summarized as follows: (1) We propose a sequence-to-sequence oriented encoder-decoder model equipped with a deep recurrent generative decoder (DRGD) to model and learn the latent\nstructure information implied in the target summaries of the training data. Neural variational inference is employed to address the intractable posterior inference for the recurrent latent variables. (2) Both the generative latent structural information and the discriminative deterministic variables are jointly considered in the generation process of the abstractive summaries. (3) Experimental results on some benchmark datasets in different languages show that our framework achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art models."

      "text" : "Automatic summarization is the process of automatically generating a summary that retains the most important content of the original text document (Nenkova and McKeown, 2012). Traditionally, the summarization methods can be classified into three categories: extraction-based methods (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Goldstein et al., 2000; Wan et al., 2007; Min et al., 2012; Nallapati et al., 2017; Cheng and Lapata, 2016; Cao et al., 2016; Song et al., 2017), compression-based methods (Li et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013; Li et al., 2015, 2017), and abstraction-based methods. In fact, previous investigations show that human-written summaries are more abstractive (Barzilay and McKeown, 2005; Bing et al., 2015). Abstraction-based approaches can generate new sentences based on the facts from different source sentences. Barzilay and McKeown (2005) employed sentence fusion to generate a new sentence. Bing et al. (2015) proposed a more fine-grained fusion framework, where new sentences are generated by selecting and merging salient phrases. These methods can be regarded as a kind of indirect abstractive summarization, and complicated constraints are used to guarantee the linguistic quality.\nRecently, some researchers employ neural network based framework to tackle the abstractive summarization problem. Rush et al. (2015) proposed a neural network based model with local attention modeling, which is trained on the Gigaword corpus, but combined with an additional loglinear extractive summarization model with handcrafted features. Gu et al. (2016) integrated a copying mechanism into a seq2seq framework to improve the quality of the generated summaries. Chen et al. (2016) proposed a new attention mechanism that not only considers the important source\nsegments, but also distracts them in the decoding step in order to better grasp the overall meaning of input documents. Nallapati et al. (2016) utilized a trick to control the vocabulary size to improve the training efficiency. The calculations in these methods are all deterministic and the representation ability is limited. Miao and Blunsom (2016) extended the seq2seq framework and proposed a generative model to capture the latent summary information, but they do not consider the recurrent dependencies in their generative model leading to limited representation ability.\nSome research works employ topic models to capture the latent information from source documents or sentences. Wang et al. (2009) proposed a new Bayesian sentence-based topic model by making use of both the term-document and termsentence associations to improve the performance of sentence selection. Celikyilmaz and HakkaniTur (2010) estimated scores for sentences based on their latent characteristics using a hierarchical topic model, and trained a regression model to extract sentences. However, they only use the latent topic information to conduct the sentence salience estimation for extractive summarization. In contrast, our purpose is to model and learn the latent structure information from the target summaries and use it to enhance the performance of abstractive summarization."

      "text" : "As shown in Figure 2, the basic framework of our approach is a neural network based encoderdecoder framework for sequence-to-sequence learning. The input is a variable-length sequence X = {x1,x2, . . . ,xm} representing the source text. The word embedding xt is initialized randomly and learned during the optimization process. The output is also a sequence Y = {y1,y2, . . . ,yn}, which represents the generated abstractive summaries. Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) is employed as the basic sequence modeling component for the encoder and the decoder. For latent structure modeling, we add historical dependencies on the latent variables of Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) and propose a deep recurrent generative decoder (DRGD) to distill the complex latent structures implied in the target summaries of the training data. Finally, the abstractive summaries will be decoded out based\non both the discriminative deterministic variables H and the generative latent structural information Z."

      "text" : "Assume that we have obtained the source text representation he ∈ Rkh . The purpose of the decoder is to translate this source code he into a series of hidden states {hd1,hd2, . . . ,hdn}, and then revert these hidden states to an actual word sequence and generate the summary.\nFor standard recurrent decoders, at each time step t, the hidden state hdt ∈ Rkh is calculated using the dependent input symbol yt−1 ∈ Rkw and the previous hidden state hdt−1:\nhdt = f(yt−1,h d t−1) (1)\nwhere f(·) is a recurrent neural network such as vanilla RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014). No matter which one we use for f(·), the common transformation operation is as follows:\nhdt = g(W d yhyt−1 +W d hhh d t−1 + b d h) (2)\nwhere Wdyh ∈ Rkh×kw and Wdhh ∈ Rkh×kh are the linear transformation matrices. bdh is the bias. kh is the dimension of the hidden layers, and kw is the dimension of the word embeddings. g(·) is the non-linear activation function. From Equation 2, we can see that all the transformations are deterministic, which leads to a deterministic recurrent hidden state hdt . From our investigations, we find that the representational power of such deterministic variables are limited. Some more complex latent structures in the target summaries, such as the high-level syntactic features and latent topics, cannot be modeled effectively by the deterministic operations and variables.\nRecently, a generative model called Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) (Kingma and Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014) shows strong capability in modeling latent random variables and improves the performance of tasks in different fields such as sentence generation (Bowman et al., 2016) and image generation (Gregor et al., 2015). However, the standard VAEs is not designed for modeling sequence directly. Inspired by (Chung et al., 2015), we extend the standard VAEs by\nintroducing the historical latent variable dependencies to make it be capable of modeling sequence data. Our proposed latent structure modeling framework can be viewed as a sequence generative model which can be divided into two parts: inference (variational-encoder) and generation (variational-decoder). As shown in the decoder component of Figure 2, the input of the original VAEs only contains the observed variable yt, and the variational-encoder can map it to a latent variable z ∈ Rkz , which can be used to reconstruct the original input. For the task of summarization, in the sequence decoder component, the previous latent structure information needs to be considered for constructing more effective representations for the generation of the next state.\nFor the inference stage, the variational-encoder can map the observed variable y<t and the previous latent structure information z<t to the posterior probability distribution of the latent structure variable pθ(zt|y<t, z<t). It is obvious that this is a recurrent inference process in which zt contains the historical dynamic latent structure information. Compared with the variational inference process pθ(zt|yt) of the typical VAEs model, the recurrent framework can extract more complex and effective latent structure features implied in the sequence data.\nFor the generation process, based on the latent structure variable zt, the target word yt at the time step t is drawn from a conditional probability distribution pθ(yt|zt). The target is to maximize the probability of each generated summary y = {y1,y2, . . . ,yT } based on the generation process according to:\npθ(y) = T∏ t=1 ∫ pθ(yt|zt)pθ(zt)dzt (3)\nFor the purpose of solving the intractable integral of the marginal likelihood as shown in Equation 3, a recognition model qφ(zt|y<t, z<t) is introduced as an approximation to the intractable true posterior pθ(zt|y<t, z<t). The recognition model parameters φ and the generative model parameters θ can be learned jointly. The aim is to reduce the Kulllback-Leibler divergence (KL) between qφ(zt|y<t, z<t) and pθ(zt|y<t, z<t):\nDKL[qφ(zt|y<t, z<t)‖pθ(zt|y<t, z<t)]\n= ∫ z qφ(zt|y<t, z<t) log qφ(zt|y<t, z<t) pθ(zt|y<t, z<t) dz = Eqφ(zt|y<t,z<t)[log qφ(zt|·)− log pθ(zt|·)]\nwhere · denotes the conditional variables y<t and z<t. Bayes rule is applied to pθ(zt|y<t, z<t), and we can extract log pθ(z) from the expectation, transfer the expectation term Eqφ(zt|y<t,z<t) back to KL-divergence, and rearrange all the terms. Consequently the following holds:\nlog pθ(y<t) = DKL[qφ(zt|y<t, z<t)‖pθ(zt|y<t, z<t)] + Eqφ(zt|y<t,z<t)[log pθ(y<t|zt)] −DKL[qφ(zt|y<t, z<t)‖pθ(zt)]\n(4)\nLetL(θ, φ; y) represent the last two terms from the right part of Equation 4:\nL(θ, ϕ; y) = Eqφ(zt|y<t,z<t) {∑T\nt=1 log pθ(yt|zt) −DKL[qφ(zt|y<t, z<t)‖pθ(zt)] } (5)\nSince the first KL-divergence term of Equation 4 is non-negative, we have log pθ(y<t) ≥ L(θ, φ; y) meaning that L(θ, φ; y) is a lower bound (the objective to be maximized) on the marginal likelihood. In order to differentiate and optimize the\nlower bound L(θ, φ; y), following the core idea of VAEs, we use a neural network framework for the probabilistic encoder qφ(zt|y<t, z<t) for better approximation."

      "text" : "We also design a neural network based framework to conduct the variational inference and generation for the recurrent generative decoder component similar to some design in previous works (Kingma and Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014; Gregor et al., 2015). The encoder component and the decoder component are integrated into a unified abstractive summarization framework. Considering that GRU has comparable performance but with less parameters and more efficient computation, we employ GRU as the basic recurrent model which updates the variables according to the following operations:\nrt = σ(Wxrxt +Whrht−1 + br) zt = σ(Wxzxt +Whzht−1 + bz) gt = tanh(Wxhxt +Whh(rt ht−1) + bh) ht = zt ht−1 + (1− zt) gt\nwhere rt is the reset gate, zt is the update gate. denotes the element-wise multiplication. tanh is the hyperbolic tangent activation function.\nAs shown in the left block of Figure 2, the encoder is designed based on bidirectional recurrent neural networks. Let xt be the word embedding vector of the t-th word in the source sequence. GRU maps xt and the previous hidden state ht−1 to the current hidden state ht in feed-forward direction and back-forward direction respectively:\n⇀ ht = GRU(xt, ⇀\nht−1) ↼ ht = GRU(xt, ↼ ht−1) (6)\nThen the final hidden state het ∈ R2kh is concatenated using the hidden states from the two directions: het = ⇀ ht|| ↼\nh. As shown in the middle block of Figure 2, the decoder consists of two components: discriminative deterministic decoding and generative latent structure modeling.\nThe discriminative deterministic decoding is an improved attention modeling based recurrent sequence decoder. The first hidden state hd1 is initialized using the average of all the source input\nstates: hd1 = 1 T e T e∑ t=1 het , where h e t is the source input hidden state. T e is the input sequence length.\nThe deterministic decoder hidden state hdt is calculated using two layers of GRUs. On the first layer, the hidden state is calculated only using the current input word embedding yt−1 and the previous hidden state hd1t−1:\nhd1t = GRU1(yt−1,h d1 t−1) (7)\nwhere the superscript d1 denotes the first decoder GRU layer. Then the attention weights at the time step t are calculated based on the relationship of hd1t and all the source hidden states {het}. Let ai,j be the attention weight between hd1i and h e j , which can be calculated using the following formulation:\nai,j = exp(ei,j)∑T e j′=1 exp(ei,j′) ei,j = v T tanh(Wdhhh d1 i +W e hhh e j + ba)\nwhere Wdhh ∈ Rkh×kh , Wehh ∈ Rkh×2kh , ba ∈ Rkh , and v ∈ Rkh . The attention context is obtained by the weighted linear combination of all the source hidden states:\nct = ∑T e\nj′=1 at,j′h\ne j′ (8)\nThe final deterministic hidden state hd2t is the output of the second decoder GRU layer, jointly considering the word yt−1, the previous hidden state hd2t−1, and the attention context ct:\nhd2t = GRU2(yt−1,h d2 t−1, ct) (9)\nFor the component of recurrent generative model, inspired by some ideas in previous works (Kingma and Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014; Gregor et al., 2015), we assume that both the prior and posterior of the latent variables are Gaussian, i.e., pθ(zt) = N (0, I) and qφ(zt|y<t, z<t) = N (zt;µ,σ2I), where µ and σ denote the variational mean and standard deviation respectively, which can be calculated via a multilayer perceptron. Precisely, given the word embedding yt−1, the previous latent structure variable zt−1, and the previous deterministic hidden state hdt−1, we first project it to a new hidden space:\nhezt = g(W ez yhyt−1+W ez zhzt−1+W ez hhh d t−1+b ez h )\nwhere Wezyh ∈ R kh×kw , Wezzh ∈ R kh×kz , Wezhh ∈ Rkh×kh , and bezh ∈ R\nkh . g is the sigmoid activation function: σ(x) = 1/(1 + e−x). Then the\nGaussian parameters µt ∈ Rkz and σt ∈ Rkz can be obtained via a linear transformation based on hezt :\nµt = W ez hµh ez t + b ez µ\nlog(σ2t ) = Whσh ez t + b ez σ\n(10)\nThe latent structure variable zt ∈ Rkz can be calculated using the reparameterization trick:\nε ∼ N (0, I), zt = µt + σt ⊗ ε (11)\nwhere ε ∈ Rkz is an auxiliary noise variable. The process of inference for finding zt based on neural networks can be teated as a variational encoding process.\nTo generate summaries precisely, we first integrate the recurrent generative decoding component with the discriminative deterministic decoding component, and map the latent structure variable zt and the deterministic decoding hidden state hd2t to a new hidden variable:\nh dy t = tanh(W dy zhzt +W dz hhh d2 t + b dy h ) (12)\nGiven the combined decoding state hdyt at the time t, the probability of generating any target word yt is given as follows:\nyt = ς(W d hyh dy t + b d hy) (13)\nwhere Wdhy ∈ Rky×kh and bdhy ∈ Rky . ς(·) is the softmax function. Finally, we use a beam search algorithm (Koehn, 2004) for decoding and generating the best summary."

The comparison results on the validation datasets of Gigawords and LCSTS are shown in Table 1. From the results we can see that our proposed generative decoders DRGD can obtain obvious improvements on abstractive summarization than the standard decoders. Actually, the performance of the standard\ndecoders is similar with those mentioned popular baseline methods.\nThe results on the English datasets of Gigawords and DUC-2004 are shown in Table 2 and Table 3 respectively. Our model DRGD achieves the best summarization performance on all the ROUGE metrics. Although ASC+FSC1 also uses a generative method to model the latent summary variables, the representation ability is limited and it cannot bring in noticeable improvements. It is worth noting that the methods lvt2k-1sent and lvt5k-1sent (Nallapati et al., 2016) utilize linguistic features such as parts-of-speech tags, namedentity tags, and TF and IDF statistics of the words as part of the document representation. In fact, extracting all such features is a time consuming work, especially on large-scale datasets such as\nGigawords. lvt2k and lvt5k are not end-to-end style models and are more complicated than our model in practical applications.\nThe results on the Chinese dataset LCSTS are shown in Table 4.

Although CopyNet employs a copying mechanism to improve the summary quality and RNN-distract considers attention information diversity in their decoders, our model is still better than those two methods demonstrating that the latent structure information learned from target summaries indeed plays a role in abstractive summarization.

The source texts, golden summaries, and the generated summaries are shown in Table 5. From the cases we can observe that DRGD can indeed capture some latent structures which are consistent with the golden summaries. For example, our result for S(1) “Wuhan wins men’s soccer title at Chinese city games” matches the “Who Action What” structure. However, the standard decoder StanD ignores the latent structures and generates some loose sentences, such as the results for S(1) “Results of men’s volleyball at Chinese city games” does not catch the main points. The reason is that the recurrent variational auto-encoders used in our framework have better representation ability and can capture more effective and complicated latent structures from the sequence data. Therefore, the summaries generated by DRGD have consistent latent structures with the ground truth, leading to a better ROUGE evaluation."
