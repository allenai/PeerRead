      "text" : "Neural machine translation (NMT) (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015), which directly models the translation process in an end-to-end way, has attracted intensive attention from the community. Although NMT has achieved state-of-the-art translation performance on resource-rich language pairs such as English-French and German-English (Luong et al., 2015; Jean et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2016), it still suffers from the unavailability of large-scale parallel corpora for translating low-resource languages. Due to the large parameter space, neural models usually learn poorly from low-count events, resulting in a poor choice for low-resource language pairs. Zoph et al. (2016) indicate that NMT obtains much worse\ntranslation quality than a statistical machine translation (SMT) system on low-resource languages.\nAs a result, a number of authors have endeavored to explore methods for translating language pairs without parallel corpora available. These methods can be roughly divided into two broad categories: multilingual and pivot-based. Firat et al. (2016b) present a multi-way, multilingual model with shared attention to achieve zeroresource translation. They fine-tune the attention part using pseudo bilingual sentences for the zeroresource language pair. Another direction is to develop a universal NMT model in multilingual scenarios (Johnson et al., 2016; Ha et al., 2016). They use parallel corpora of multiple languages to train one single model, which is then able to translate a language pair without parallel corpora available. Although these approaches prove to be effective, the combination of multiple languages in modeling and training leads to increased complexity compared with standard NMT.\nAnother direction is to achieve source-to-target NMT without parallel data via a pivot, which is either text (Cheng et al., 2016a) or image (Nakayama and Nishida, 2016). Cheng et al. (2016a) propose a pivot-based method for zeroresource NMT: it first translates the source language to a pivot language, which is then translated to the target language. Nakayama and Nishida (2016) show that using multimedia information as pivot also benefits zero-resource translation. However, pivot-based approaches usually need to divide the decoding process into two steps, which is not only more computationally expensive, but also potentially suffers from the error propagation problem (Zhu et al., 2013).\nIn this paper, we propose a new method for zero-resource neural machine translation. Our method assumes that parallel sentences should\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n00 75\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\nM ay\n2 01\n7\nhave close probabilities of generating a sentence in a third language. To train a source-to-target NMT model without parallel corpora available (“student”), we leverage an existing pivot-to-target NMT model (“teacher”) to guide the learning process of the student model on a source-pivot parallel corpus. Compared with pivot-based approaches (Cheng et al., 2016a), our method allows direct parameter estimation of the intended NMT model, without the need to divide decoding into two steps. This strategy not only improves efficiency but also avoids error propagation in decoding. Experiments on the Europarl and WMT datasets show that our approach achieves significant improvements in terms of both translation quality and decoding efficiency over a baseline pivot-based approach to zero-resource NMT on Spanish-French and German-French translation tasks."

      "heading" : "2 Background",
      "text" : "Neural machine translation (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015) advocates the use of neural networks to model the translation process in an end-to-end manner. As a data-driven approach, NMT treats parallel corpora as the major source for acquiring translation knowledge.\nLet x be a source-language sentence and y be a target-language sentence. We use P (y|x;θx→y)\nto denote a source-to-target neural translation model, where θx→y is a set of model parameters. Given a source-target parallel corpus Dx,y, which is a set of parallel source-target sentences, the model parameters can be learned by maximizing the log-likelihood of the parallel corpus:\nθ̂x→y = argmax θx→y { ∑ 〈x,y〉∈Dx,y logP (y|x;θx→y) } .\nGiven learned model parameters θ̂x→y, the decision rule for finding the translation with the highest probability for a source sentence x is given by\nŷ = argmax y\n{ P (y|x; θ̂x→y) } . (1)\nAs a data-driven approach, NMT heavily relies on the availability of large-scale parallel corpora to deliver state-of-the-art translation performance (Wu et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2016). Zoph et al. (2016) report that NMT obtains much lower BLEU scores than SMT if only small-scale parallel corpora are available. Therefore, the heavy dependence on the quantity of training data poses a severe challenge for NMT to translate zeroresource language pairs.\nSimple and easy-to-implement, pivot-based methods have been widely used in SMT for\ntranslating zero-resource language pairs (de Gispert and Mariño, 2006; Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Wu and Wang, 2007; Bertoldi et al., 2008; Wu and Wang, 2009; Zahabi et al., 2013; Kholy et al., 2013). As pivotbased methods are agnostic to model structures, they have been adapted to NMT recently (Cheng et al., 2016a; Johnson et al., 2016).\nFigure 1(a) illustrates the basic idea of pivotbased approaches to zero-resource NMT (Cheng et al., 2016a). Let X, Y, and Z denote source, target, and pivot languages. We use dashed lines to denote language pairs with parallel corpora available and solid lines with arrows to denote translation directions.\nIntuitively, the source-to-target translation can be indirectly modeled by bridging two NMT models via a pivot:\nP (y|x;θx→z,θz→y) = ∑ z P (z|x;θx→z)P (y|z;θz→y). (2)\nAs shown in Figure 1(a), pivot-based approaches assume that the source-pivot parallel corpus Dx,z and the pivot-target parallel corpus Dz,y are available. As it is impractical to enumerate all possible pivot sentences, the two NMT models are trained separately in practice:\nθ̂x→z = argmax θx→z { ∑ 〈x,z〉∈Dx,z logP (z|x;θx→z) } ,\nθ̂z→y = argmax θz→y { ∑ 〈z,y〉∈Dz,y logP (y|z;θz→y) } .\nDue to the exponential search space of pivot sentences, the decoding process of translating an unseen source sentence x has to be divided into two steps:\nẑ = argmax z\n{ P (z|x; θ̂x→z) } , (3)\nŷ = argmax y\n{ P (y|ẑ; θ̂z→y) } . (4)\nThe above two-step decoding process potentially suffers from the error propagation problem (Zhu et al., 2013): the translation errors made in the first step (i.e., source-to-pivot translation) will affect the second step (i.e., pivot-to-target translation).\nTherefore, it is necessary to explore methods to directly model source-to-target translation without parallel corpora available."

The basic idea is to use a pre-trained pivot-to-target model (“teacher”) to guide the learning process of a source-to-target model (“student”) without training data available on a source-pivot parallel corpus. One advantage of our approach is that Equation (1) can be used as the decision rule for decoding, which avoids the error propagation problem faced by two-step decoding in pivot-based approaches.\nAs shown in Figure 1(b), we still assume that a source-pivot parallel corpus Dx,z and a pivot-target parallel corpus Dz,y are available. Unlike pivot-based approaches, we first use the pivot-target parallel corpus Dz,y to obtain a teacher model P (y|z; θ̂z→y), where θ̂z→y is a set of learned model parameters. Then, the teacher model “teaches” the student model P (y|x;θx→y) on the source-pivot parallel corpus Dx,z based on the following assumptions.\nAssumption 1 If a source sentence x is a translation of a pivot sentence z, then the probability of generating a target sentence y from x should be close to that from its counterpart z.\nWe can further introduce a word-level assumption:\nAssumption 2 If a source sentence x is a translation of a pivot sentence z, then the probability of generating a target word y from x should be close to that from its counterpart z, given the already obtained partial translation y<j .\nThe two assumptions are empirically verified in our experiments (see Table 2). In the following subsections, we will introduce two approaches to zero-resource neural machine translation based on the two assumptions."

(8)\nWith learned source-to-target model parameters θ̂x→y, we use the standard decision rule as shown in Equation (1) to find the translation ŷ for a source sentence x.\nHowever, a major difficulty faced by our approach is the intractability in calculating the gradients because of the exponential search space of target sentences. To address this problem, it is possible to construct a sub-space by either sampling (Shen et al., 2016), generating a k-best list (Cheng et al., 2016b) or mode approximation (Kim and Rush, 2016). Then, standard stochastic gradient descent algorithms can be used to optimize model parameters."

All the sentences are tokenized by the tokenize.perl script. All the experiments treat English as the pivot language and French as the target language.\nFor the Europarl corpus, we evaluate our proposed methods on Spanish-French (Es-Fr) and German-French (De-Fr) translation tasks in a\nzero-resource scenario. To avoid the trilingual corpus constituted by the source-pivot and pivottarget corpora, we split the overlapping pivot sentences of the original source-pivot and pivot-target corpora into two equal parts and merge them separately with the non-overlapping parts for each language pair. The development and test sets are from WMT 2006 shared task.1 The evaluation metric is case-insensitive BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) as calculated by the multi-bleu.perl script. To deal with out-of-vocabulary words, we adopt byte pair encoding (BPE) (Sennrich et al., 2016) to split words into sub-words. The size of sub-words is set to 30K for each language.\nFor the WMT corpus, we evaluate our approach on a Spanish-French (Es-Fr) translation task with a zero-resource setting. We combine the following corpora to form the Es-En and En-Fr parallel corpora: Common Crawl, News Commentary, Europarl v7 and UN. All the sentences are tokenized by the tokenize.perl script. Newstest2011 serves as the development set and Newstest2012 and Newstest2013 serve as test sets. We use case-sensitive BLEU to evaluate translation results. BPE is also used to reduce the vocabulary size. The size of sub-words is set to 43K, 33K, 43K for Spanish, English and French, respectively. See Table 1 for detailed statistics for the Europarl and WMT corpora.\nWe leverage an open-source NMT toolkit dl4mt implemented by Theano 2 for all the experiments and compare our approach with state-of-the-art multilingual methods (Firat et al., 2016b) and pivot-based methods (Cheng et al., 2016a).

We run beam search on the pivot sentence with the teacher model and choose the highest-scoring target sentence as the mode. Beam size with k = 1 (greedy decoding) and k = 5 are investigated in our experiments, denoted as sent-greedy and sent-beam, respectively.3\n2. Word-Level Teaching: we use the same mode approximation approach as in sentence-level teaching to approximate the expectation in Equation 12, denoted as word-greedy (beam search with k = 1) and word-beam (beam search with k = 5), respectively. Besides, Monte Carlo estimation by sampling from the teacher model is also investigated since it introduces more diverse data, denoted as wordsampling."

Random sampling brings a large variance (Sutskever et al., 2014; Ranzato et al., 2015; He et al., 2016) for sentence-level teaching.

The results on test set for Eureparl Corpus are 32.24 BLEU over Spanish-French translation and 24.91 BLEU over German-French translation, which are slightly better than the sent-beam method.

We use the same data preprocessing as in (Cheng et al., 2016a). We find that both the sent-beam and word-sampling methods outperform the pivot-based approaches in a zero-resource scenario across language pairs. Our word-sampling method improves over the best performing zero-resource pivot-based method (soft) on Spanish-French translation by +3.29 BLEU points and German-French translation by +3.24 BLEU points. In addition, the word-sampling mothod surprisingly obtains improvement over the likelihood method, which leverages a source-target parallel corpus. The\nsignificant improvements can be explained by the error propagation problem of pivot-based methods, which propagates translation error of the source-to-pivot translation process to the pivot-to-target translation process.\nTable 4 shows BLEU scores on the Europarl corpus of our five proposed methods. For sentence-level approaches, the sent-beam method outperforms the sent-greedy method by +0.59 BLEU points over Spanish-French translation and +2.51 BLEU points over German-French translation on the test set. The results are in line with our observation in Table 2 that sentence-level KL divergence by beam approximation is smaller than that by greedy approximation. However, as the\ntime complexity grows linearly with the number of beams k, the better performance is achieved at the expense of search time.\nFor word-level experiments, we observe that the word-sampling method performs much better than the other two methods: +1.94 BLEU points on Spanish-French translation and +1.88 BLEU points on German-French translation over the word-greedy method; +2.65 BLEU points on Spanish-French translation and +2.84 BLEU points on German-French translation over the word-beam method. Although Table 2 shows that word-level KL divergence approximated by sampling is larger than that by greedy or beam, sampling approximation introduces more data diversity for training, which dominates the effect of KL divergence difference.\nWe plot validation loss4 and BLEU scores over iterations on the German-French translation task in Figure 2. We observe that word-level models\n4Validation loss: the average negative log-likelihood of sentence pairs on the validation set.\ntend to have lower validation loss compared with sentence-level methods. Generally, models with lower validation loss tend to have higher BLEU. Our results indicate that this is not necessarily the case: the sent-beam method converges to +0.31 BLEU points on the validation set with +13 validation loss compared with the word-beam method. Kim and Rush (2016) claim a similar observation in data distillation for NMT and provide an explanation that student distributions are more peaked for sentence-level methods. This is indeed the case in our result: on German-French translation task the argmax for the sent-beam student model (on average) approximately accounts for 3.49% of the total probability mass, while the corresponding number is 1.25% for the word-beam student model and 2.60% for the teacher model."

They used the multi-way NMT model trained by other language pairs to generate a pseudo parallel corpus and fine-tuned the attention mechanism of the multi-way NMT model to enable zero-resource translation. Several authors proposed a universal encoder-decoder network in multilingual scenarios to perform zero-shot learning (Johnson et al., 2016; Ha et al., 2016). This universal model extracts translation knowledge from multiple different languages, making zero-resource translation feasible without direct training.\nBesides multilingual NMT, another important line of research attempts to bridge source and target languages via a pivot language. This idea is widely used in SMT (de Gispert and Mariño, 2006; Cohn and Lapata, 2007; Utiyama and Isahara, 2007; Wu and Wang, 2007; Bertoldi et al., 2008; Wu and Wang, 2009; Zahabi et al., 2013; Kholy et al., 2013).

Nakayama and Nishida (2016) achieve zero-resource machine translation by utilizing image as a pivot and training multimodal encoders to share common semantic representation.\nOur work is also related to knowledge distillation, which trains a compact model to approximate the function learned by a larger, more complex model or an ensemble of models (Bucila et al., 2006; Ba and Caurana, 2014; Li et al., 2014; Hinton et al., 2015). Kim and Rush (2016) first introduce knowledge distillation in neural machine translation. They suggest to generate a pseudo corpus to train the student network.

In this paper, we propose a method for zero-resource NMT by assuming that parallel sentences have close probabilities of generating a sentence in a third language. Based on this assumption, our method is able to train a source-to-target NMT model (“student”) without parallel corpora available, guided by an existing pivot-to-target NMT model (“teacher”) on a source-pivot parallel corpus. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves over a baseline pivot-based model by +3.0 BLEU points across various language pairs.",
