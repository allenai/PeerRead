      "text" : "Deep learning has achieved great successes in recent years. It has produced superior results in a range of applications, including image classification (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton, 2012), speech recognition (Hinton et al., 2012; Mikolov et al., 2011), language translation (Sutskever, Vinyals, and Le, 2014) and so on. It is now time to ask whether it is possible and beneficial to learn structures for deep models.\nTo learn the structure of a deep model, we need to determine the number of hidden layers and the number of hidden units at each layer. More importantly, we need to determine the connections between neighboring layers. This implies that we need to talk about sparse models where neighboring layers are not fully connected.\nSparseness is desirable and full connectivity is unnecessary. In fact, Han et al. (2015) have shown that many weak connections in the fully connected layers of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (Lecun et al., 1998) can be pruned without incurring any accuracy loss. The convolutional layers of CNNs are sparse, and the fact is considered one of the key factors that lead to the success of CNNs. Moreover, it is well known that overfitting is a serious problem in deep models. One method to address the problem is dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014), which randomly drops out units (while keeping full connectivity) during training. The possibility of randomly dropping connections has also been explored in Wan et al. (2013). Sparseness offers an interesting alternative. It amounts to deterministically drop out connections.\nHow can one learn sparse deep models? One method is to first learn a fully connected model and then prune weak con-\nnections (Han et al., 2015). The drawbacks of this method are that it is computationally wasteful and doesn’t provide a way to determine the number of hidden units. We would like to develop a method that determines the number of hidden units and the connections between units automatically. The key intuition is that a hidden unit should be connected to a group of strongly correlated units at the level below. This idea is used in convolutional layers of CNNs, where a unit is connected to pixels in a small patch of an image. In image analysis, spatial proximity implies strong correlation.\nTo apply the intuition to applications other than image analysis, we need to identify groups of strongly correlated variables for which latent variables should be introduced. Hierarchical Latent Tree Analysis (HLTA) (Liu et al 2014, Chen et al 2016) offers a plausible solution. HLTA first partitions all the variables into groups such that the variables in each group are strongly correlated and the correlations can be properly modelled using a single latent variable. It introduces a latent variable for each group. Then it converts the latent variables into observed variables via data completion and repeats the process to produce a hierarchy. The output of HLTA is a hierarchical latent tree model where the observed variables are at the bottom and there are multiple layers of latent variables on top. To obtain a non-tree sparse deep model, we propose to use the tree model as a skeleton and introduce additional connections to model the residual correlations not captured by the tree.\nIn this paper, we fully develop and test the idea in the context of RBMs, which have a single layer of hidden units and are building blocks of Deep Belief Networks and Deep Boltzmann Machines. The target domain is unsupervised text analysis. We present an algorithm for learning what we call Sparse Boltzmann Machines. Empirically, we show that the full-connectivity restriction of RBMs can easily lead to overfitting, and that Sparse Boltzmann Machines are effective in avoiding overfitting. We also demonstrate that Sparse Boltzmann Machines are more interpretable than RBMs."

      "text" : "The concept of sparse RBMs were first mentioned in (Lee, Ekanadham, and Ng, 2008). The authors use sparse RBMs to build sparse Deep Belief Networks and extract some interesting features. However, in their paper, sparse RBMs were not defined from the perspective of sparse connections\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n05 29\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n7 Se\np 20\n16\nbut sparse hidden unit activations. And it was achieved by adding a regularization term to the objective function when training the parameters. There is no structure learning.\nNetwork pruning is also a potential way to optimize the structure of a neural network. Biased weight decay was the early approach to pruning. Later, Optimal Brain Damage (Cun, Denker, and Solla, 1990) and Optimal Brain Surgeon (Hassibi, Stork, and Com, 1993) suggested that magnitudebased pruning may not be the best strategies and they proposed pruning methods based on the Hessian of the loss function. With respect to deep neural networks, Han et al. (2015) proposed to compress a network through a threestep process: train, prune connections, and retrain. We call it redundancy pruning. In contrast, Srinivas and Babu (2015) proposed to prune redundant neurons directly. They all reduced the number of parameters vastly with slight or even no performance loss. The drawback of network pruning is that the original networks should be large enough and hence some computation would be wasted on those unnecessary parameters during pre-training."

      "text" : "An Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) (Smolensky, 1986) is a two-layer undirected graphical model with a layer of K visible units {v1, . . . , vK} and a layer of F hidden units {h1, . . . , hF }. The two layers are fully connected to each other, while there are no connections between units at the same layer. An example is shown in Figure 1. In the simplest case, all the units are assumed to be binary. An energy function is defined over all the units as follows:\nE(v,h) = − F∑\nj=1 K∑ k=1 W kj hjv k − K∑ k=1 vkbk − F∑ j=1 hjaj (1)\nwhere aj and bk are bias parameters for the hidden and visible units respectively, while W kj is the connection weight between hidden unit hj and visible unit vk. The energy function defines a joint probability over v and h as follows:\nP (v,h) = exp(−E(v,h))/Z (2) where Z = ∑ v′,h′ exp(−E(v\n′, h′)) is a normalization term called the partition function. An important property of RBM is that the conditional distributions P (h|v) and P (v|h) factorize as below:\nP (h|v) = ∏ j P (hj |v) P (v|h) = ∏ k P (vk|h) (3)\nP (hj = 1|v) = σ(aj + K∑\nk=1\nW kj v k) (4)\nP (vk = 1|h) = σ(bk + F∑\nj=1\nW kj hj) (5)\nwhere σ(x) = 1/(1 + e−x) is the logistic function. The model parameters of an RBM are learned using the Contrastive Divergence algorithm (Hinton, 2002), which maximizes the data likelihood via stochastic gradient descent.\nIn Hinton and Salakhutdinov (2009), RBM was used for topic modeling and the proposed model was called Replicated Softmax. Suppose the vocabulary size is K. Let us represent a document with D tokens as a binary matrix U of sizeK ∗D with uki = 1 if the ith token is the kth word in the vocabulary. The energy function of document U and hidden units h is defined as follows:\nE(U ,h) = − F∑\nj=1 K∑ k=1 W kj hj û k − K∑ k=1 ûkbk −D F∑ j=1 hjaj (6)\nwhere ûk = ∑D\ni=1 u k i denotes the count for the k th word. The conditional probabilities P (hj = 1|U) can be calculated as:\nP (hj = 1|U) = σ(Daj + K∑\nk=1\nW kj û k) (7)\nThe motivation behind Replicated Softmax is to properly model word counts in documents of varying lengths through weight sharing. It was shown to generalize better than Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei, Ng, and Jordan, 2003) in terms of log-probability on held-out documents and accuracy on retrieval tasks. In this paper, we will use Replicated Softmax for text analysis."

      "text" : "In this section, we will propose our new models, Sparse Boltzmann Machines (SBMs). An SBM is a two-layer undirected graphical model with a layer of K visible units {v1, . . . , vK} and a layer of F hidden units {h1, . . . , hF }. The hidden units in SBMs are directly linked up to form a tree structure, while each hidden unit is also individually connected to a subset of the visible units. See Figure 2 for an example SBM. In SBM, the number of hidden units and the connectivities are both learned from data.\nOne technical difference between SBMs and RBMs is that there are direct connections among the hidden units in SBMs. We call them hidden connections. The reason why we introduce the hidden connections into our models is that, the hidden connections provide a way to relate a hidden unit to a visible unit without a direct connection. For example, in Figure 2, hidden unit h1 is not directly connected to visible unit v4. However, the existence of the hidden connection between h1 and h2 introduces a path connecting h1 and v4, which can help us to better model the correlation between the two units. This is crucial in reducing the number of connections between hidden units and visible units. To avoid the connections among the hidden units becoming too dense, we restrict them to form a tree structure."

      "text" : "SBMs also can be extended for text analysis as RBMs are extended to Replicated Softmax. Here we will introduce SBMs in the context of Replicated Softmax and use the same notations in the previous section. Let G be a graph representing the model structure. Edge (j, k) belongs to G if and only if there is a link between the visible unit vk and hidden unit hj . Edge (j, l) belongs to G if and only if there is a link between the hidden unit hj and hidden unit hl. Also let Wjl be the weight on the connection between hidden unit hj and hidden unit hl. Then the energy function of an SBM for document U and hidden units h is as below:\nE(U ,h) =− ∑\n(j,k)∈G\nW kj hj û k − K∑ k=1 ûkbk\n−D F∑\nj=1\nhjaj −D ∑\n(j,l)∈G\nWjlhjhl.\n(8)\nSimilar to Replicated Softmax, our model defines the joint distribution as:\nP (U ,h) = 1 Z exp(−E(U ,h)), (9)\nwhere Z = ∑ U′ ∑ h exp(−E(U\n′,h)). Note that the summation over U ′ is done over all the possible documents with the same length as U .\nLet Ū = {Un}Nn=1 be a collection of N documents with potentially different lengths D1, . . . , DN . We assume that P (Ū) = ∏N n=1 P (Un), where P (Un) = ∑ h P (Un,h). The objective of training an SBM for Ū is to maximize the loglikelihood of the documents logP (Ū). We maximize the objective function via stochastic gradient descent. The partial derivatives of logP (Ū) w.r.t the parameters W kj , bk and aj remain the same as in Replicated Softmax:\n∂ logP (Ū) ∂W kj = N∑ n=1 (EP (hj |Un)[hj û k n]− EP (U,h)[hj ûk]) (10)\n∂ logP (Ū) ∂bk = N∑ n=1 (ûkn − EP (U)[ûk])\n∂ logP (Ū) ∂aj = N∑ n=1 Dn(EP (hj |Un)[hj ]− EP (hj)[hj ])\nwhile the partial derivative of logP (Ū) w.r.t the new parameter Wjl for fixed j and l is:\n∂ logP (Ū) ∂Wjl = N∑ n=1 Dn(EP (h|Un)[hjhl]− EP (h)[hjhl]) (11)\nThe first terms in these partial derivatives require the computation of the conditional probabilities P (hj |Un) and P (h|Un). In Replicated Softmax, P (hj |Un) can be calculated using Equation (7). While in SBMs, due to the connections between hidden units, P (h|Un) no longer factorizes and hence Equation (7) cannot be applied. Nevertheless, since the hidden units in Sparse Boltzmann Machines are linked as a tree structure, we can easily compute the value of P (hj |Un) and P (h|Un) by conducting message propagation (Murphy, 2012) in the model.\nThe second terms in these derivatives require taking an expectation with respect to the distribution defined by the model, which is intractable. Thus as in Replicated Softmax, we adopt the Contrastive Divergence algorithm to approximate the second terms by running Gibbs sampling chains in the model. Specifically, the Gibbs chains are initialized at the training data and run for T full steps to draw samples from the model. In SBMs, given a document U and the value of all the other hidden units h−j , the conditional probability to sample a hidden unit hj becomes:\nP (hj = 1|U ,h−j) = σ( ∑\n(j,k)∈G\nW kj û k +Daj+\nD ∑\n(j,l)∈G\nWjlhl +D ∑\n(l,j)∈G\nWljhl)\nwhile the conditional probability to sample an visible unit remains the same as in Replicated Softmax."

      "text" : "We regard SBMs as a method to model correlations among the visible units. Learning an SBM hence amounts to building a latent structure to explain the correlations. Recently, Liu, Zhang, and Chen (2014) and Chen et al. (2016) proposed a method, called HLTA, for learning a Hierarchical Latent Tree Model (HLTM) from data. Our structure learning algorithm for SBMs is built upon their work. We expand the tree model from HLTA to obtain the structure of an SBM.\nHLTA learns a tree model T with a layer of observed variables at the bottom and multiple layers of latent variables. Note that the visible units and hidden units in SBMs are called observed variables and latent variables in HLTM respectively. The left panel in Figure 3 and Figure 4 illustrate example models that HLTA produces. Each latent variable in the model is connected to a set of highly-correlated variables in the layer below. The number of latent variables at\neach layer is determined automatically by the algorithm. The number L of latent layers in T is controllable. In this paper, we set L = 2. Let Hl be the lth latent layer in T . Also let VZ be the set of observed variables which are located in the subtree rooted at latent variable Z in T .\nTo build the structure of an SBM from T , we first remove all the latent layers except the top layer HL. Then we connect each latent variable Z inHL to the set of observed variables VZ . We use the resulting structure as a skeleton T ′ of the corresponding SBM. This is illustrated in Figure 3, where the hidden units h1, h2 in SBM correspond to Z21, Z22 in T respectively. Note that the skeleton is still a tree structure, where each node has only one parent.\nAs to remove the tree-structure constraint, we conduct an expansion step to increase the number of “fan-out” connections for each hidden unit in T ′. The key question is how to determine the new set of visible units that a hidden unit should be connected to. We introduce our method using Z21 (correspondingly h1 in T ′) and v7 in Figure 3 as an example. To determine whether Z21 should also be connected to v7, we consider the empirical conditional mutual information I(Z21, v7|Z22, Ū), where Z22 is the root of the subtree that v7 is in. To estimate the value, we first estimate the empirical joint distribution p̂(Z21, Z22, v7). We go through all the documents and compute p(Z21, Z22|Un) for each document Un in Ū by conducting inference in T . Then we collect the statistics of Z21, Z22 and v7 to get p̂(Z21, Z22, v7). After that, I(Z21, v7|Z22, Ū) can be estimated as: I(Z21, v7|Z22, Ū) =∑ Z22 p̂(Z22) ∑ v7 ∑ Z21 p̂(Z21, v7|Z22)log p̂(Z21, v7|Z22) p̂(Z21|Z22)p̂(v7|Z22) .\nAll the distributions in the above formula can be derived from the joint distribution p̂(Z21, Z22, v7).\nIf the correlation between Z21 and v7 is properly modeled in T , the two variables should be conditionally independent given Z22, and hence I(Z21, v7|Z22, Ū) should be zero. Therefore, if I(Z21, v7|Z22, Ū) is not 0, then we can conclude that the correlation between Z21 and v7 is not properly modeled in the model, and the model needs to be expanded by adding new connections between the two variables.\nOur algorithm, called SBM-SFC (SBM-Structure from Correlation), is given in Algorithm 1. It considers the latent variables one at a time. For a given latent variable Z (suppose the corresponding hidden unit in T ′ is h), it computes the conditional mutual information between Z and each unconnected observed variable, and sorts the observed variables in descending order with respect to the conditional mutual information. Then in T ′, it connects hidden unit h to the visible units corresponding to the top M observed variables with the highest conditional mutual information.M is a predefined parameter, which normally is set to the value such that each hidden unit is connected to 0.2 ∗ K hidden units. After the above expansion step is done for each hidden unit in T ′, the whole structure of an SBM is determined."

      "text" : "Overfitting of Fully-Connected RBMs We first empirically show that, the fully-connected structure in Replicated Softmax can easily lead to overfitting once the number of hidden units (and hence the number of parameters) gets too large. Figure 5 depicts the average perplexity scores over validation data for Replicated Softmax with different number of hidden units after 30 epochs. We can see that, the optimal numbers of hidden units for the three datasets are 110, 60 and 120 respectively. After that, the performances of the models get worse when the numbers of hidden units\ngradually increase. Therefore, selecting a proper number of hidden units is crucial to Replicated Softmax since they are very likely to overfit the training data.\nGeneralizability of Sparse Boltzmann Machines and Replicated Softmax In this part, we compare the generalization performance of Sparse Boltzmann Machines with Replicated Softmax. We denote our method as SBM-SFC. Two variants of Replicated Softmax included in comparison are RS∗ and RS+. RS∗ trains Replicated Softmax with the optimal number of hidden units. RS+ produces Replicated Softmax with the same number of hidden units as SBMSFC. Since this number is normally larger than the optimal number, we denote the method as RS+. As we can see in Table 1, SBM-SFC consistently outperforms RS∗ and RS+ over the three datasets. This confirms that Replicated Softmax with full connectivity is prone to overfitting. It also shows that SBMs can lead to better model fit than fully connected RBMs. This is true even when the number of hidden units in RBMs is optimized through held-out validation. Moreover, the poor performance of RS+ shows that the performance gain of SBM-SFC cannot be attributed to the larger number of hidden units.\nComparisons with Redundancy Pruning We also compare our method with the redundancy pruning method which produces Replicated Softmax with sparse connections (Han et al., 2015). We denote the method as RS+ Pruned. It starts from a fully trained model, produced by RS+, and prunes the connections gradually until the number of connections is reduced to be the same as the model by SBM-SFC. For each hidden unit, it prunes the set of connections with the smallest absolute weight value. Then it retrains the pruned model for 1 epoch, and conducts pruning again. The pruning and retraining process is repeated until the desired sparsity is reached. In our experiments, the pruning process took 80, 40 and 40 epochs on the three datasets respectively. As shown in Table 1, SBM-SFC achieves comparable model fit as RS+ Pruned. It shows that our structure learning algorithm is effective and can ease the overfitting problem of fully connected structure as well as the pruning method does. Our method has three advantages over RS+ Pruned. First, the iterative pruning process of RS+ Pruned is computationally expensive. Second, it does not offer a way to determine the number of hidden units. One can do this using held-out validation, but that would be computationally prohibitive. Third, as will be seen later, the models produced by RS+ Pruned are not as interpretable as those obtained by our method.\nNecessity of Hidden Connections In SBMs, we impose a tree structure among the hidden units. Is this necessary? To answer the question, we compare SBM-SFC with a method for Replicated Softmax denoted as RS+ SFC. The model produced by RS+ SFC is the same as that by SBM-SFC, except that there are no connections among the hidden units. As we can see in Table 1, SBM-SFC always performs better than RS+ SFC. This supports our conjecture that the hidden connections are necessary in our models. The result is not surprising. In a multiple layer model, units at a layer are connected via units at higher layers. In a two layer model, there are no higher layers. Hence it is natural to connect the second-layer units directly. To generalize our work to multiple layers, we will need to add connections only among the hidden units at the top layer.\nInterpretability of Sparse Boltzmann Machines and Replicated Softmax Next we compare the interpretability of Sparse Boltzmann Machines and Replicated Softmax. Here is how we interpret hidden units. For each hidden unit, we sort the words in descending order of the absolute value of the connection weights between the words and the hidden unit. The top 10 words with the highest absolute weights are chosen to characterize the hidden unit. We propose to measure the “interpretability” of a hidden unit by considering how similar pairs of words in the top-10 list are. The similarity between two words is determined using a word2vec model (Mikolov et al., 2013a,b) trained on part of the Google News datasets 4, where each word is mapped to a high dimensional vector. The similarity between two words is defined as the consine similarity of the two corresponding vectors. High similarity suggests that the two words appear in similar contexts. Let L be the list of words representing a hidden unit. We define the compactness of L to be the average similarity between pairs of words in L. We also call it the interpretability score of the hidden unit. Note that\n4https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/\nsome of the words in Lmight not be in the vocabulary of the word2vec model we use. This happens infrequently. When it does, the words are simply skipped. Suppose there are F hidden units in a model. Let C1, ...CF be the interpretability scores of hidden units. We define the interpretability score of the model as: Q = 1F ∑F f=1 Cf . Obviously the score depends heavily on the number of hidden units. Table 2 reports the interpretability scores of the models produced by RS+, RS+ Pruned and SBM-SFC. The models all have the same number of hidden units and hence their interpertability scores are comparable. SBM-SFC consistently performs the best over the three datasets, showing superior coherency and compactness in the characterizations of the hidden units and thus better model interpretability. Table 3 shows the characterizations of selected hidden units in the models produced by SBM-SFC. They are clearly meaningful."

In this paper we have developed, for models with a single hidden layer, a method to determine the number of hidden units and the connections among the units. The models obtained by the method are significantly better, in terms of held-out likelihood, than RBMs where the hidden and observed units are fully connected. This is true even when the number of hidden units in RBMs is optimized by heldout validation. In comparison with redundancy pruning, our method is more efficient and is able to determine the number of hidden units. Moreover, it produces more interpretable models. In the future, we will generalize the structure learning method to models with multiple hidden layers."
