The method makes use of three steps: 1) a method for deriving cross-lingual word clusters, that can then be used in a multilingual parser; 2) a method for transferring lexical information from a target language to source language treebanks; 3) a method for integrating these steps with the density-driven annotation projection method of Rasooli and Collins (2015). Experiments show improvements over the state-of-the-art in several languages used in previous work (Rasooli and Collins, 2015; Zhang and Barzilay, 2015; Ammar et al., 2016), in a setting where the only source of translation data is the Bible, a considerably smaller corpus than the Europarl corpus used in previous work. Results using the Europarl corpus as a source of translation data show additional improvements over the results of Rasooli and Collins (2015). We conclude with results on 38 datasets (26 languages) from the Universal Dependencies corpora: 13 datasets (10 languages) have unlabeled attachment accuracies of 80% or higher; the average unlabeled accuracy on the 38 datasets is 74.8%."

New York.\nsyntactic transfer, where a parsing model is trained for some language of interest, using only treebanks in other languages. There is a clear motivation for this in building parsing models for languages for which treebank data is unavailable. Methods for syntactic transfer include annotation projection methods (Hwa et al., 2005; Ganchev et al., 2009; McDonald et al., 2011; Ma and Xia, 2014; Rasooli and Collins, 2015; Lacroix et al., 2016; Agić et al., 2016), learning of delexicalized models on universal treebanks (Zeman and Resnik, 2008; McDonald et al., 2011; Täckström et al., 2013; Rosa and Zabokrtsky, 2015), treebank translation (Tiedemann et al., 2014; Tiedemann, 2015; Tiedemann and Agić, 2016) and methods that leverage cross-lingual representations of word clusters, embeddings or dictionaries (Täckström et al., 2012; Durrett et al., 2012; Duong et al., 2015; Zhang and Barzilay, 2015; Xiao and Guo, 2015; Guo et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2016; Ammar et al., 2016).\nThis paper considers the problem of cross-lingual syntactic transfer with limited resources of monolingual and translation data. Specifically, we use the Bible corpus of Christodouloupoulos and Steedman (2014) as a source of translation data, and Wikipedia as a source of monolingual data. We deliberately limit ourselves to the use of Bible translation data because it is available for a very broad set of languages: the data from Christodouloupoulos and Steedman (2014) includes data from 100 languages. The Bible data contains a much smaller set of sentences (around 24,000) than other translation corpora, for example Europarl (Koehn, 2005), which has around 2 million sentences per language\npair. This makes it a considerably more challenging corpus to work with. Similarly, our choice of Wikipedia as the source of monolingual data is motivated by the availability of Wikipedia data in a very broad set of languages.\nWe introduce a set of simple but effective methods for syntactic transfer, as follows:\n• We describe a method for deriving crosslingual clusters, where words from different languages with a similar syntactic or semantic role are grouped in the same cluster. These clusters can then be used as features in a shiftreduce dependency parser.\n• We describe a method for transfer of lexical information from the target language into source language treebanks, using word-to-word translation dictionaries derived from parallel corpora. Lexical features from the target language can then be integrated in parsing.\n• We describe a method that integrates the above two approaches with the density-driven approach to annotation projection described in (Rasooli and Collins, 2015).\nExperiments show that our model outperforms previous work on a set of European languages from the Google universal treebank (McDonald et al., 2013): we achieve 80.9% average unlabeled attachment score (UAS) on these languages; in comparison the work of Zhang and Barzilay (2015), Guo et al. (2016) and Ammar et al. (2016) have UAS of 75.4%, 76.3% and 77.8% respectively. All of these previous works make use of the much larger Europarl (Koehn, 2005) corpus to derive lexical representations. When using Europarl data instead of the Bible, our approach gives 83.86% accuracy, a 1.68% absolute improvements over (Rasooli and Collins, 2015). Finally, we conduct experiments on 38 datasets (26 languages) in the universal dependencies v1.3 (Nivre et al., 2016) corpus. Our method has an average unlabeled dependency accuracy of 74.8% for these languages, compared to an average accuracy of 68.1% for the method of Rasooli and Collins (2015). 13 datasets (10 languages) have accuracies higher than 80.0%.1\n1 The parser code is available at https://github. com/rasoolims/YaraParser/tree/transfer."

In our experiments we use the shift-reduce dependency parser of Rasooli and Tetreault (2015), which is an extension of the approach in (Zhang and Nivre, 2011). The parser is trained using the averaged structured perceptron (Collins, 2002).\nWe assume that the feature vector φ(x, y) is the concatenation of three feature vectors:\n• φ(p)(x, y) is an unlexicalized set of features. Each such feature may depend on the part-ofspeech (POS) tag of words in the sentence, but does not depend on the identity of individual words in the sentence.\n• φ(c)(x, y) is a set of cluster features. These features require access to some dictionary that maps each word in the sentence to an underlying cluster identity. Clusters may for example be learned using the Brown clustering algorithm (Brown et al., 1992). The features may make use of cluster identities in combination with POS tags.\n• φ(l)(x, y) is a set of lexicalized features. Each such feature may depend directly on word identities in the sentence. These features may also depend on part-of-speech tags or cluster information, in conjunction with lexical information.\nAppendix A has a full description of the features used in our experiments."

The model for a target language is trained on treebank data from languages where at least 4 out of 6 WALS properties are common between the source and target language.3 This gives a slightly stronger baseline: our experiments showed an improvement in average labeled dependency accuracy for the languages from 62.52% to 63.18%. Table 2 shows the set of source languages used for each target language; these source languages are used for all experiments in the paper.\nSelf-training. We use self-training (McClosky et al., 2006) to further improve parsing performance. Specifically, we first train a delexicalized model on treebanks T1 . . . Tm; then use the resulting model to parse a dataset Tm+1 that includes target-language sentences which have POS tags but do not have dependency structures. We finally use the automatically parsed data T ′m+1 as the treebank data and retrain the model; this last model is trained using all features (unlexicalized, clusters, and lexicalized). Self-training in this way gives an improvement in labeled accuracy from 63.18% to 63.91%."

We first run the GIZA++ alignment process (Och and Ney, 2000) on the data Bi,j . We then keep intersected alignments between sentences in the two languages. Finally, for each word w in Li, we define w′ = t(w, i, j) to be the target language word most frequently aligned to w in the aligned data. If a word w is never seen aligned to a target language word w′, we define t(w, i, j) = NULL.\nFuture work may consider the use of probabilistic lexicons, or hand-crafted lexicons, as an alternative to the method described above."

A clustering is a function C(w) that maps\nInputs: 1) Monolingual texts Di for i = 1 . . . (m+ 1); 2) a function t(w, i, j) that translates a word w ∈ Li to w′ ∈ Lj ; and 3) a parameter α such that 0 < α < 1.\neach word w in a vocabulary to a cluster C(w) ∈ {1 . . . K}, where K is the number of clusters. A hierarchical clustering is a function C(w, l) that maps a word w together with an integer l to a cluster at level l in the hierarchy. As one example, the Brown clustering algorithm (Brown et al., 1992) gives a hierarchical clustering. The level l allows cluster features at different levels of granularity.\nA cross-lingual hierarchical clustering is a function C(w, l) where the clusters are shared across the (m + 1) languages of interest: that is, the word w can be from any of the (m + 1) languages. Ideally, a cross-lingual clustering should put words across different languages which have a similar syntactic and/or semantic role in the same cluster. There is a clear motivation for cross-lingual clustering in the parsing context. We can use the cluster-based features φ(c)(x, y) on the source language treebanks T1 . . . Tm, and these features will now generalize beyond these treebanks to the target language Lm+1.\nWe learn a cross-lingual clustering by leveraging the monolingual data sets D1 . . .Dm+1, together\nwith the translation dictionaries t(w, i, j) learned from the translation data. Figure 1 shows the algorithm that learns a cross-lingual clustering. The algorithm first prepares a multilingual corpus, as follows: for each sentence s in the monolingual data Di, for each word in s, with probability α we replace the word with its translation into some randomly chosen language. Once this data is created, we can easily obtain a cross-lingual clustering. Figure 1 shows the complete algorithm. The intuition behind this method is that by creating the crosslingual data in this way, we bias the clustering algorithm towards putting words that are translations of each other in the same cluster."

      "heading" : "3.2 Treebank Lexicalization",

Tm for the m source languages, together with the translation lexicons t(w, i,m + 1). For any word w in the source treebank data, we can look up its translation t(w, i,m+1) in the lexicon, and add this translated form to the underlying sentence. Features can now consider lexical identities derived in this way. In many cases the resulting translation will be the NULL word. However, we still make use of the representations φ(p)(x, y) and φ(c)(x, y) as previously defined; these representations are useful when the NULL translation is observed.\n3.3 Integration with the Density-Driven Projection Method of Rasooli and Collins (2015)\nIn this section we describe a method for integrating our approach with the cross-lingual transfer method of Rasooli and Collins (2015), which makes use of density-driven projections.\nIn annotation projection methods (Hwa et al., 2005; McDonald et al., 2011), it is assumed that we have translation data Bi,j for a source and target language, and that we have a dependency parser in the source language Li. The translation data consists of pairs (e, f) where e is a source language sentence, and f is a target language sentence. A method such as GIZA++ is used to derive an alignment between the words in e and f , for each sentence pair; the source language parser is used to\nparse e. Each dependency in e is then potentially transferred through the alignments to create a dependency in the target sentence f . Once dependencies have been transferred in this way, a dependency parser can be trained on the dependencies in the target language.\nThe density-driven approach of Rasooli and Collins (2015) makes use of various definitions of “density” of the projected dependencies. For example, P100 is the set of projected structures where the projected dependencies form a full projective parse tree for the sentence; P80 is the set of projected structures where at least 80% of the words in the projected structure are a modifier in some dependency. An iterative training process is used, where the parsing algorithm is first trained on the set T100 of complete structures, and where progressively less dense structures are introduced in learning.\nWe integrate our approach with the density-driven approach of Rasooli and Collins (2015) as follows: Consider the treebanks T1 . . . Tm created using the lexicalization method of §3.2. We add all trees in these treebanks to the set P100 of full trees used to initialize the method of Rasooli and Collins (2015). In addition we make use of the representations φ(p), φ(c) and φ(l), throughout the learning process."

More specifically, we use the 7 European languages in the Google universal treebank (v.2; standard data) (McDonald et al., 2013). As in previous work, gold part-of-speech tags are used for evaluation. We use the concatenation of the treebank training sentences, Wikipedia data and the Bible monolingual sentences as our monolingual raw text. Table 3 shows statistics for the monolingual data. We use the Bible data from Christodouloupoulos and Steedman (2014), which includes data for 100 languages, as the source of translations. We also con-\nduct experiments with the Europarl data (both with the original size and a subset of it with the same size as the Bible text) to study the effects of translation data size and domain shift. The statistics for translation data is shown in Table 4.\nIn a second set of experiments, we run experiments on 38 datasets (26 languages) in the more recent Universal Dependencies v1.3 corpus (Nivre et al., 2016).4\nBrown Clustering Algorithm We use the off-theshelf Brown clustering tool5 (Liang, 2005) to train monolingual Brown clusters with 500 clusters. The monolingual Brown clusters are used as features over lexicalized values created in φ(l), and in selftraining experiments. We train our cross-lingual clustering with the off-the-shelf-tool6 from Stratos et al. (2015). We set the window size to 2 with cluster size of 500.7\nParsing Model We use the k-beam arc-eager dependency parser of Rasooli and Tetreault (2015), which is similar to the model of Zhang and Nivre (2011). We modify the parser such that it can use both monolingual and cross-lingual word cluster features. The parser is trained using the the maximum violation update strategy (Huang et al., 2012).\n4We excluded languages that are not completely present in the Bible corpus of Christodouloupoulos and Steedman (2014) (Ancient Greek, Basque, Catalan, Galician, Gothic, Irish, Kazakh, Latvian, Old Church Slavonic, and Tamil). We also excluded Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese and Chinese, as these languages have tokenization and/or morphological complexity that goes beyond the scope of this paper. Future work should consider these languages.\n5https://github.com/percyliang/ brown-cluster\n6https://github.com/karlstratos/singular 7Usually the original Brown clusters are better features for parsing but their training procedure does not scale on big datasets.

It can be seen that each of these three steps gives significant improvements in performance. The final LAS/UAS of 73.90/80.28% is several percentage points higher than the baseline accuracy of 63.91/72.94%.\nWe also run experiments with a subset of the Europarl data to see the effect of domain shift. As shown in Table 5, we observe that there is a slight drop in accuracy when we use the Bible data. The main exception is the English language, where the number of translation sentences is twice more than the sampled Europarl sentences.\nComparison to the Density-Driven Approach using Europarl Data Table 6 shows accuracies for the density-driven approach of Rasooli and Collins\n(2015), first using Europarl data8 and second using the Bible data alone (with no cross-lingual clusters or lexicalization). The Bible data is considerably smaller than Europarl (around 100 times smaller), and it can be seen that results using the Bible are several percentage points lower than the results for Europarl (75.75% UAS vs. 81.33% UAS). Integrating cluster and lexicalized features described in the current paper with the density-driven approach closes much of this gap in performance (80.28% UAS). Thus we have demonstrated that we can get close to the performance of the Europarl-based models using only the Bible as a source of translation data. Using our appraoch on the full Europarl data gives an average UAS of 82.95%, an improvement from the 81.33% UAS of Rasooli and Collins (2015).\nTable 6 also shows results when we use a random subset of the Europarl data, where the number of sentences (25,000) is chosen to give a very similar size to the Bible dataset. It can be seen that accuracies using the Bible data vs. Europarl-Sample are very similar (80.28% vs. 80.37% UAS), suggesting that the size of the translation corpus is much more important than the genre.\nComparison to Other Previous Work Table 7 compares the accuracy of our method to the following related work: 1) Zhang and Barzilay (2015), who describe a method that learns cross-lingual embeddings and bilingual dictionaries from Europarl data, and uses these features in a discriminative parsing model; 2) Guo et al. (2016), who describe a method that learns cross-lingual embeddings from Europarl data and uses a shift-reduce neural parser with these representations; 3) Ammar et al. (2016), who use the same embeddings as Guo et al. (2016), within an LSTM-based parser; and 4) Rasooli and Collins (2015) who use the density-driven approach on the Europarl data. Our method gives significant improvements over the first three models, in spite of using the Bible translation data rather than Europarl. When using the Europarl data, our method improves the state-of-the-art model of Rasooli and Collins (2015). It is worth noting that our model significantly outperform the UAS reported in other\n8Rasooli and Collins (2015) do not report results on English.

Although there is a drop in accuracy when using the automatic POS tags, our model has still a high accuracy even higher than those from the density driven approach of Rasooli and Collins (2015)."

We\nfind interesting examples for which our method predicts the correct tree, including some long sentences (Figures 3a and 3b). Except for very short sentences with basic grammatical structures, the baseline parser completely fails to recover the correct structure. In Figure 2, two examples are depicted for which the baseline parser has a very low accuracy while our method is fully accurate. In the first example, the baseline parser attaches the root node to a wrong verb (“plug” instead of “goes”) and subsequently attaches incorrect dependents. In the first example in Figure 2, the baseline parser cannot find the head of the noun phrase (“diversified Fidelity funds”). Because of the lack of lexical features, the baseline parser attaches the word “after” as a prepositional phrase instead of assigning it as a dependent\nfor the adverbial clause (“they reported earnings”). Figure 3a shows two examples in which the parser trained using the Europarl data is the only model to parse the sentences perfectly. As expected, the baseline parser does a poor job in parsing these sentences. Surprisingly however, the parser from our approach using the Bible data is able to predict the majority of dependencies correctly. In the first example, it has two labeled errors and one punctuation attachment error9 and just one attachment error: it\n9Punctuation is not included in evaluation.\nattaches “taking” as a conjunction for “straightening” instead of attaching it as a “parataxis” for the word “seems”. In the second example, there is a prepositional attachment error for the word “about” and consequently another attachment error because “about” is not the dependent of “prediction” in that sentence. In general, we can see that the parser trained with the Bible data is able to recover correct dependencies, largely beating the baseline.\nFigure 4 shows an example in which the fully supervised parser is completely accurate but our best parser makes some errors. In this specific example, the word “which” has a determiner POS tag and is wrongly attached as a determiner to the next noun, while it should be a prepositional object. To compensate for that, the parser wrongly attaches “CNN” to “under” as a prepositional object. There is also a labeled attachment error for the word “under”.\nFrom the above examples, we can conclude that having more translation data helps distinguish between correct and incorrect attachments. Having more accurate projected trees help improve the syntactic ordering, and having more translation data gives rise to the quality of word clusters and lexical features."

The work of Rasooli and Collins (2015) gives the best results of these methods on the Europarl data, as shown in Table 7.\nOther recent work (Tiedemann et al., 2014; Tiedemann, 2015; Tiedemann and Agić, 2016) has considered treebank translation, where a statistical machine translation system (e.g., MOSES (Koehn et al., 2007)) is used to translate a source language treebank into the target language, complete with reordering of the input sentence. The lexicalization approach described in this paper is a simple form of treebank translation, where we use a word-to-word translation model. In spite of its simplicity, it is a very effective approach.\nA number of authors have considered incorporating universal syntactic properties such as dependency order by selectively learning syntactic attributes from similar source languages (Naseem et al., 2012; Täckström et al., 2013; Zhang and Barzilay, 2015; Ammar et al., 2016). Selective sharing of syntactic properties is complementary to our work; we used a very limited form of selective sharing, through the WALS properties, in our baseline approach.\nA number of authors (Täckström et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2015; Guo et al., 2016) have introduced methods that learn cross-lingual representations that are then used in syntactic transfer. Most of these approaches introduce constraints to a clustering or embedding algorithm that encourage words that are translations of each other to have similar representations. Our method of deriving a cross-lingual corpus\n(see Figure 1) which is then used as input to a clustering algorithm is closely related to (Duong et al., 2015; Gouws and Søgaard, 2015; Wick et al., 2015)."

      "text" : "We have described a method for cross-lingual syntactic transfer that is effective in the scenario where a large amount of translation data is not available. We have introduced a simple, direct method for deriving cross-lingual clusters, and for transferring lexical information across treebanks for different languages. Experiments with the method show that the method gives improved performance over previous work that makes use of Europarl, a much larger translation corpus."

      "text" : "We used all features in (Zhang and Nivre, 2011, Table 1 and 2), which describes features based on the word and part-of-speech at various positions on the stack and buffer of the transition system. In addition, we expand the Zhang and Nivre (2011, Table 1) features to include clusters, as follows: whenever a feature tests the part-of-speech for a word in position 0 of the stack or buffer, we introduce features that replace the part-of-speech with the Brown clustering bit-string of length 4 and 6. Whenever a feature tests for the word identity at position 0 of the stack or buffer, we introduce a cluster feature that replaces the word with the full cluster feature. We take the cross product of all features corresponding to the choice of 4 or 6 length bit string for part-ofspeech features."

The method makes use of three steps: 1) a method for deriving cross-lingual word clusters, that can then be used in a multilingual parser; 2) a method for transferring lexical information from a target language to source language treebanks; 3) a method for integrating these steps with the density-driven annotation projection method of Rasooli and Collins (2015). Experiments show improvements over the state-of-the-art in several languages used in previous work (Rasooli and Collins, 2015; Zhang and Barzilay, 2015; Ammar et al., 2016), in a setting where the only source of translation data is the Bible, a considerably smaller corpus than the Europarl corpus used in previous work. Results using the Europarl corpus as a source of translation data show additional improvements over the results of Rasooli and Collins (2015). We conclude with results on 38 datasets (26 languages) from the Universal Dependencies corpora: 13 datasets (10 languages) have unlabeled attachment accuracies of 80% or higher; the average unlabeled accuracy on the 38 datasets is 74.8%.",
