      "text" : "Introduction\nWorking towards a Computational Theory of Intelligence, we develop a computational framework inspired by ideas from Neuroscience. Specifically, we integrate notions of columnar organization, hierarchical structure, sparse distributed representations, and sparse coding.\nAn integrated view of Intelligence has been proptosed by Karl Friston based on free-energy [13, 11, 8, 9, 10, 12]. In this framework, Intelligence is viewed as a surrogate minimization of the entropy of this sensorium. This work is intuitively inspired by this view, aiming to provide a computational foundation for a theory of intelligence from the perspective of theoretical computer science, thereby connecting to ideas in mathematics. By building foundations for a principled approach, the computational essence of problems can be isolated, formalized, and their relationship to fundamental problems in mathematics and theoretical computer science can be illuminated and the full power of available mathematical techniques can be brought to bear.\nA computational approach is focused on developing tractable algorithms. exploring the complexity limits of Intelligence. Thereby improving the quality of available guarantees for evaluating performance of models, improving comparisons among models, and moving towards provable guarantees such as sample size, time complexity, generalization error, assumptions about prior. This furnishes a solid theoretical foundation which may be used, among other things, as a basis for building Artificial Intelligence.\nar X\niv :1\n10 6.\n03 57\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n2 J\nun 2\n01 1\n0.1 Background Literature In A Glance\nSpeculation on a cortical micro-circuit element dates back to Mountcastle’s observation that a cortical column may serve as an algorithmic building block of the neocortex [18]. Later work by Lee and Mumford [16], Hawkins and George [14] attempted further investigation of this process.\nThe bottom-up organization of cortex is generally assumed to be a hetrarchical topology of columns. This can be modeled as a directed acyclic graph, but is usually simplified to a hierarchical tree. Work by Poggio, Serre, et al [20, 21, 22, 23], Dean [6, 7], discuss a hierarchical topology. Smale et al attempts to develop a theory accounting for the importance of the hierarchical structure [24, 3].\nWork on modeling early stages of sensory processing by Olshausen [19, 1] using sparse coding produced results that account for the observed receptive fields in early visual processing. This is usually done by learning an overcomplete dictionary. However it remained unclear how to extend this to higher layers. Our work can be partially viewed as a progress in this direction.\nComputational Learning Theory is the formal study of learning algorithms. PAC defines a natural setting for analyzing such algorithms. However, with few notable exceptions (Boosting, inspiration for SVM, etc) the produced guarantees are divorced from practice. Without tight guarantees Machine Learning is studied using experimental results on standard benchmarks, which is problematic. We aim at closing the gap between theory and practice by providing stronger assumptions on the structures and forms considered by the theory, through constraints inspired by biology and complex systems.\n0.2 A Variety of Hierarchical Models\nSeveral hierarchical models have been introduced in the literature. H-Max is based on Simple-Complex cell hierarchy of Hubel and Wiesel. It is basically a hierarchical succession of template matching and a max-operations, corresponding to simple and complex cells respectively [20].\nHierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is a learning model composed of a hierarchy of spatial coincidence detection and temporal pooling. Coincidence detection involves finding a spatial clustering of the input, while temporal pooling is about finding variable order Markov chains describing temporal sequences in the data.\nH-Max can be mapped into HTM in a straightforward manner. In HTM, the transformations in which the data remains invariant is learned in the temporal pooling step. H-Max explicitly hard codes translational transformations through the max operation. This gives H-Max better sample complexity for the specific problems where translational invariance is present.\nBouvrie et al [3, 2] introduced a generalization of hierarchical architectures centered around a foundational element involving two steps, Filtering and Pooling. Filtering is described through a reproducing Kernel K(x, y), such as the standard inner product K(x, y) = 〈x, y〉, or a Gaussian kernel K(x, y) = e−γ‖x−y‖ 2\n. Pooling then remaps the result to a single value. Examples of pooling functions include max, mean, and lp norm (such as l1 or l∞). H-max, Convolutional Neural Nets, and Deep Feedforward Neural Networks all belong to this category of hierarchical architectures corresponding to\ndifferent choices of the Kernel and Pooling functions. Our model does not fall within Bouvrie’s present framework, and can be viewed as a generalization of hierarchical models in which both HTM and Bouvrie’s framework are a special case.\nFriston proposed Hierarchical Dynamic Models (HDM) which are similar to the above mentioned architectures but framed in a control theoretic framework operating in continuous time [8]. A computational formalism of his approach is thus prohibitively difficult.\n0.3 Scope\nOur approach to the circuit element is an attempt to abstract the computationally fundamental processes. We conjecture a class of possible circuit elements for bottom-up processing of the sensory stream.\nFeedback processes, mediating action and attention, can be incorporated into this model, similar to work by Chikkerur et al [5, 4], and more generically to a theory by Friston [10, 9]. We choose to leave feedback for future work, allowing us to focus here on basic aspects of this model.\n0.4 Contribution and Organization\nThe following section introduces a novel formulation of an elemental building block that could serve as a the bottom-up piece in the common cortical algorithm. This circuit element combines Dictionary Learning and Dimension Reduction (DLDR). After formally introducing DRDL, we show how it can be used to iteratively construct a Hierarchical Sparse Representations (HSR) of a sensory stream. Comparisons to relevant known models are presented. To gain further insight, the model is applied to standard vision datasets. This immediately leads to a classification algorithm that uses HSR for feature extraction. In the appendix, we discuss how further assumptions about the prior can naturally be expressed in our framework."

      "text" : "Dictionary Learning obtains a sparse representation by learning features on which the data xi can be written in sparse linear combinations.\nDefinition 1. Given an input set X = [x0 . . . xm], xi ∈ Rd, Dictionary Learning finds D = [v0 . . . vn] and θ = [θi . . . θm], such that xi = Dθi and ‖θi‖0 ≤ s.\nWhere the ‖.‖0 is the L0-norm or sparsity. If all entries of θi are restricted to be non-negative, we obtain Sparse-Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SNMF).\nAn optimization version of Dictionary Learning can be written as:\nmin D∈Rd,n max xi\nmin ‖θi‖0 : xi = Dθi\nIn practice, the Dictionary Learning problem is often relaxed to the Lagrangian:\nmin ‖X −Dθ‖2 + λ‖θ‖1 Where X = [x0...xm] and θ = [θ0...θm]. Several dictionary learning algo-\nrithms work by iterating the following two steps.\n1. Solve the vector selection problem for all vectors X. This can be done using your favourite vector selection algorithm, such as basis pursuit.\n2. Given X, the optimization problems is now convex in D. Use your favorite method to find D.\nUsing a maximum likelihood formalism, the Method of Optimal Dictionary (MOD) uses the psuedoinverse to compute D:\nD(i+1) = Xθ(i) T (θnθi T )−1.\nThe MOD can be extended to Maximum A-Posteriori probability setting with different priors to take into account preferences in the recovered dictionary. Similarly, k-SVD uses an two step iterative process, with a Truncated Singular Value Decomposition to update D. This is done by taking every atom in D and applying SVD to X and θ restricted to only the columns that that have contribution from that atom.\nWhen D is restricted to be of the form D = [B1, B2 . . . BL] where Bi’s are orthonormal matrices, then a more efficient pursuit algorithm is obtained for the sparse coding stage using a block coordinate relaxation."

      "text" : "The DL step learns a representation θi of the input that lives in a high dimension, but we can obtain a lower dimensional representation, since θi is now readily seen as sparse in the standard orthonormal basis of dimension n. We can obtain a dimension reduction by using applying a linear operator satisfying the Restricted Isometry Property from Compressed Sensing theory.\nDefinition 2. A linear operator A has the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) for s, iff ∃δs such that:\n(1− δs) ≤ ‖Ax‖22 ‖x‖22 ≤ (1 + δs) (1)\nAn RIP matrix can compress sparse data while maintaining their approximate relative distances. This can be seen by considering two s-sparse vectors x1 and x2, then:\n(1− δ2s) ≤ ‖Ax1 −Ax2‖22 ‖x1 − x2‖22 ≤ (1 + δ2s) (2)\nGiven an s-sparse vector of dimension n, RIP reduces the dimension to O(s log(n)). Since we are using an RIP matrix, efficient decompression is guaranteed using L1 approximation. The data can be recovered exactly using L1 minimization algorithms such as Basis Pursuit.\nRIP matrices can be obtained probabilistically from matrices with random Gaussian entries. Alternatively RIP matrices can be obtained using sparse random matrices [15]. In this paper we follow the latter approach. The question of deterministically constructing RIP matrices with similar bounds is still open."

The representations correspond to the standard basis in d = 3. The best dimension reduction to d = 2 is then simply the projection of the representations onto the plane perpendicular to (1, 1, 1).

These variables are only relevant for this section. The two problems can be stated as:\n1. DL asks for D and {x1 . . . xm}, given {y1 . . . ym}, for Dxi = yi, such that the sparsity ‖xi‖0 is minimized for a fixed dimension of yi.\n2. DR asks for D and {y1 . . . ym}, given {x1 . . . xm}, for Dxi = yi, such that the dimension of yi’s is minimized for a fixed sparsity ‖xi‖0.\nIn practice, both problems use L1 approximation as a proxy for L0 optimization. This leads to the following observation\nObservation. The inverse of a DRDL is a DRDL.\nThis means that the space of mappings/functions of our model is the same as it’s inverse. This property will be useful for incorporating feedback."

      "text" : "DRDL can be thought of a memory system (’memory pocket’) or a dimension reduction technique for data that can be expressed sparsely in a dictionary. One parameter trade-off is between n, the number of columns in D, and s, the sparsity of the representation.\nOn one hand, we note that the DR step puts the data in O(slog(n)) dimension. Therefore, if we desire to maximize the reduction in dimension, increasing n by raising it to a constant power k is comparable to multiplying s by k. This means that we much rather increase the number of columns in the dictionary than the sparsity. On other hand, increasing the number of columns in D forces the columns to be highly correlated. Which will become problematic for Basis Pursuit vector selection.\nThis trade-off highlights the importance of investigating approaches to dictionary learning and vector selection that can go beyond current results into highly coherent dictionaries. We will further discuss this topic in future papers."

In this paper we assume that both the topology of generative model and the spatial and temporal extent of each node is known. Discussion of algorithms for learning the topology and internal dimensions is left for future work.\nConsider a simple data stream consisting of a spatiotemporal sequences from a generative model defined above.

      "text" : "This simple, yet powerful, toy model is used as a basis investigation tool for our future work. We abstracted this model out of a need for conceptual simplicity and generality. Several models inspired by the neocortex have been proposed, many sharing similar characteristics. We present a few here and compare to our model.\nH-Max is mapped to HSR by replacing Basis Pursuit for Sparse Approximation with Template Matching. H-Max uses random templates from the data, whereas HSR uses Dictionary Learning. The ’max’ operation in H-Max can be understood in terms of the operation of sparse coding, which produces local competition among features representing slight variations in the data. Alternatively, the ’max’ operation can be viewed as a limited form of dimension reduction.\nHTM can be mapped to HSR by considering time as another dimension of space. This way, bounded variable order markov chains can be written as Sparse Approximation of spatiotemporal vectors representing sequences of spacial vectors in time. HTM constructs a set of spatial coincidences that is automatically shared across time. HSR may do the same when fed a moving window of spatial sequences. Alternatively, HSR will simulate an HTM by alternating between time-only and space-only spatiotemporally extended blocks. In this view a single HTM node is mapped to two layer HSR nodes, one representing time, and the other representing space. Unlike HTM, treating time and space on equal footing has the added advantage that the same algorithms used be used for both. HTM with winner-takes-all policy can then be mapped to our model by assuming sparsity s = 1. HTM with distribution on belief states can be mapped to our model with Template Matching instead of Sparse Approximation in the inference step. Finally, HTM does not leverage RIP dimension reduction step. HTM uses feedback connections for prediction, which is restricted to predictions forward in time. Extending HSR with feedback connections, which accounts for dependency between nodes that are not connected directly, enables feedback to affect all space-time."
    }, {
      "heading" : "2.5 What does HSR offer beyond current models?",
      "text" : "One advantage of our approach is in providing invertibility without a dimensionality blow-up for hierarchically sparse data. Models falling under Bouvrie et al’s framework loose information as you proceed up the hierarchy due to the Pooling operation. This becomes problematic when extending the models to incorporate feedback. Moreover, this information loss forces an algorithm designer to hardcode what invariances a particular model must select for (such as translational invariance in H-max). On the other hand, invertible models such as HTM suffer from dimensionality blow up, when the number of features learned at a given level is greater than the input dimension to that level - as is usually the case. Dimensionality reduction achieves both a savings in computational resources as well as better noise resilience by avoiding overfitting.\nDictionary learning represents the data by sparse combinations of dictionary columns. This can be viewed as a L0 or L1 regularization, which provides noise tolerance and better generalization. This type of regularization is intuitive and is well motivated by neuroscience [19, 1] and the organization of complex systems.\nOur approach departs from current models that use simple template matching and leverages the expressive power of Sparse Approximation. This provides a disciplined prescription for learning features at every level. Finally, HSR is a conceptually simple model. This elegance lends itself well to analysis."

      "heading" : "2.6 Discussion of Trade-offs in HSR",

For instance consider the simplified case of binary {0, 1} coefficients and translation invariance (such as vision). An HSR generative model of two layers will produce ( m2 s2 ) patterns. Learning this with a single layer HSR would involve learning a dictionary of m2 columns and s2 sparsity using |X| samples in dimension d. Using two layers, we have the first layer learning a dictionary of size m1 and sparsity s1 using k ∗ |X| samples in dimension dk , the second layer learns a dictionary of size m2 columns and s2 with |X| samples in dimension k ∗O(s1 ∗ logm1) < d.

We show how this foundational element can be used to iteratively construct a Hierarchical Sparse Representation (HSR) of a sensory stream. We compare our approach to existing models showing the generality of our simple prescription. We then perform preliminary experiments using this framework, illustrating with the example of an object recognition task using standard datasets. This work introduces the very first steps towards an integrated framework for designing and analyzing various computational tasks from learning to attention to action. The ultimate goal is building a mathematically rigorous, integrated theory of intelligence.",
