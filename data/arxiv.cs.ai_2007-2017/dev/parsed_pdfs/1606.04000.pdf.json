      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "A knowledge base (KB) is a database of facts about the world, together with an inference engine to perform deductive reasoning on those facts. Most of the facts in a KB are expressed using first-order predicates, creating links between two objects in the database that expresses their relationship, such as (capitalCity Paris France). The brain organizes long term, explicit, semantic memory in a way that is very different from a knowledge base. We seem to be able to call up a concept from memory\n• by thinking of concepts whose meaning is similar.\n• by completing an analogy.\n• based on attributes, including attributes we didn’t previously realize characterized that concept.\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n04 00\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n• by seeing an example of the concept.\n• by deductive reasoning based on related concepts.\n• by calling to mind an image and reasoning about details of the image.\nSuppose I am looking for a specific animal– a cardinal, for example. If I had a set of facts in my memory like “you can find things where they live” and “all birds live in the woods” and “cardinals are a type of bird” then I could reason using deductive logic that I should look for cardinals in the woods. But I don’t actually have many facts which are universally true in my memory, and deductive reasoning relies heavily on universal statements. What I have instead are many specific pieces of knowledge, which are useful only for analogical reasoning: I have often heard bluejays in trees, and cardinals look a little like bluejays (except red instead of blue and black) and there are a lot of trees in the woods. I know that hummingbirds live in tiny nests in small trees and eagles build enormous eyries in tall trees (which is nearly the same thing as a nest), and cardinals are somewhere in between, so (reasoning by a kind of analogy) I am looking for a nest a few times the size of a cardinal in an average-sized tree. Maybe I could find them by looking for what they like to eat, but I’m not sure exactly what cardinals eat. I’m nearly certain sparrows like to eat small seeds, and I’m pretty sure birds eat little bugs. Maybe larger birds eat larger bugs? But blue whales eat krill, which is very tiny, so not always, though if a bigger bird eats smaller bugs it must eat a lot more of them... and so on. It is a mess of biased reasoning, stereotypes, prejudice, ignorance, and unfounded analogy; but I come to a sensible conclusion that if not exactly correct is workable, at least. When it is a problem we know very little about, such reasoning takes a little time and effort, but many times a day we solve similar problems nearly instantly and without conscious thought.\nIf we try to imagine doing this kind of thing with a knowledge base, it looks impossible. How could we ever hope to encode all the facts we know about these subjects, and to what degree they are certain, and in what ways they are related? How could we hope to build a reasoning system that can handle the kind of fuzzy, approximate, analogical, incorrect reasoning I am describing, and come up with any kind of useful results? The system described in this paper is an attempt to solve such problems.\nSince the 1970s, researchers have been attempting to build large knowledge bases that contain much of the common sense knowledge that we make use of whenever we interpret a sentence or answer a question. The results of this effort have been disappointing, due to two main difficulties. The first is that a KB is inflexible: if a query is not entered using exactly the right terms and predicates that the creators of the KB envisioned, it gives no answer at all. The second problem is that all KBs are incomplete: because all facts need to be entered by hand, even decades of work have left enormous gaps in what KBs contain about the world.\nIn the last few years, a new approach has appeared to encoding semantic relations that implicitly contains a great deal of the same kind of world knowledge we would like to have in a KB. Using a large corpus of natural language text, a distributional semantic vector space (DSVS) can be automatically created. A DSVS represents natural language words and phrases as high-dimensional vectors. Vectors which are nearby1 in this space are semantically similar. A remarkable property of these vectors is that one can perform a kind of analogical reasoning by simply doing arithmetic with these vectors: subtract the vector for the word ‘man’ from the vector for ‘king’ and add the vector for ‘woman’ and one gets a vector very close to the vector for the term ‘queen.’ This ability to automatically find analogies has enormous potential,\n1Nearness in a DSVS is typically measured using a cosine metric or a Euclidean metric.\nand research into the area has exploded since the word2vec DSVS was introduced in [16]. The challenge in using a DSVS is finding ways to handle approximate and implicit knowledge.\nSuppose we want the answer to a query using a term that has no facts asserted regarding it in the KB. A DSVS allows us to find related terms which are in the database, and find the answers to those related queries. This is very useful at overcoming the KB inflexibility problem. However, the word2vec DSVS allows us to go one step farther, and address the KB incompleteness problem as well. We can make use of these related terms and their associated query results to set up an analogy problem with the original unknown term so that its solution (obtained from the DSVS) is the answer to the original query. Both the KB and DSVS have explicit maps to natural language, which allows us to connect concepts in the KB to concepts in the DSVS and back by way of the natural language term they are both associated with. We have built a system called Displacer that connects a KB and DSVS in this way, and demonstrated the increases in coverage and accuracy that the system produces on a range of tasks."

      "heading" : "2 Biological Inspiration",
      "text" : "In 1984, Geoff Hinton [12] outlined ways in which distributed representations, characteristic of a DSVS, were more biologically plausible than the local representations used in KBs. He pointed out that both the strengths of human memory (content-addressible, generalization, analogy making) and its weaknesses (the difficulty of remembering an arbitrary string of concepts) are similar to those of distributed representations.\nBrain-imaging studies have likewise suggested that concepts are represented in the brain as distributed networks of neural activation [18]. A DSVS can be interpreted as a neurally plausible model of how memories could be encoded. [2]. In particular, the analogical-reasoning capability of a DSVS can be understood as an example of the relational priming model of analogy making outlined in [15]. There is evidence that object categories are represented as a continuous semanatic space across the surface of the brain. [14] The brain’s slow operating speed and massive paralellism (compared to a CPU) also hint that whatever operations are being performed must be very short, simple programs operating on large vectors, more characteristic of A DSVS than a KB. Together, all of these clues suggest that whatever representation of concepts is used in the brain, it is much more similar to a DSVS than a KB.\nThe system described in this paper is an attempt to take advantage of the benefits that these more neurologically plausible representations of concepts allow. Its hybrid nature is probably merely an intermediate step towards an integrated model in which all the operations in deductive reasoning are also carried out on the vectors themselves. In the meantime, however, the KB, while not itself biologically inspired or plausible, is convenient for applying mutiple Horn rules and keeping track of the steps of the reasoning process in a way that is not yet convenient in a DSVS."

      "heading" : "3.1 Answering Queries with the ResearchCyc KB",
      "text" : "Queries in ResearchCyc are formulated in a lisp-like language called CycL. A typical query is (capitalCity ?X France). The predicate, capitalCity, is the first term in the triple. The second term in this case is a variable, represented as ?X. The answers to the query are the expressions in CycL which substituted for ?X make a true statement, as deduced from the knowledge and rules in the KB.\nThe ResearchCyc KB contains natural language paraphrases for most concepts in the database, and has the ability to convert noun phrases into the corresponding Cyc representation. For example, the noun phrase “rich ruler” returns the following possible Cyc interpretations:\nword2cyc Cyc command: (ps-get-cycls-for-phrase “rich ruler”) Results: (SubcollectionOfWithRelationToFn Leader personalWealthOwned GreatWealth)a (SubcollectionOfWithRelationToFn Leader affiliatedWith MarkRich) (SubcollectionOfWithRelationToFn Leader affiliatedWith AdrienneRich) (SubcollectionOfWithRelationToFn Leader affiliatedWith RichardCronin-Musician) (CollectionIntersection2Fn Leader (SubcollectionOfWithRelationToFn HomoSapiens lastName “rich”)) (SubcollectionOfWithRelationToTypeFn Leader affiliatedWith (SubcollectionOfWithRelationToFn HomoSapiens lastName “rich”))b\nai.e. “wealthy leader” bi.e. “leader named (or affiliated with someone named) Rich”\nThe possible interpretations of “rich” in terms of food (containing sugar and cream) and “ruler” as a tool (a shorter yardstick) are ruled out by the KB due to their incompatibility with each other:“rich” in that sense can only describe food, and “ruler” in that sense cannot own wealth.\nIn addition, Cyc has a limited ability to generate natural language paraphrases for the statements it generates in response to queries. For example, feeding the first Cyc result for “rich ruler” above back into the KB gives the following (mildly incorrect and stilted English) paraphrase:\ncyc2word Cyc command: (generate-text-w/sentential-force ’(#$SubcollectionOfWithRelationToFn #$Leader #$personalWealthOwned #$GreatWealth) ) Result: “leader whose personal wealth is: wealth”\nThese two functions (which we call word2cyc and cyc2word to be consistent with the name of the function word2vec), allow the Displacer system we’ve constructed to take a natural language term or phase, include it in a query, and map the answer to the query back into natural language (see Fig. 1). While ResearchCyc has a large vocabulary, many terms do not map to any expression in the KB. In contrast, the DSVS contains essentially all commonly used English words. We additionally used synonym and part-of-speech information from wordnet to augment the KB for some tasks.\nUsing the ResearchCyc KB to support web queries is explored in [7]. They write, “Although problematic, it would be worthwhile to use ResearchCyc to support web queries. The reason is that, as far as we know, it is the only ontology that contains linguistic, semantic and factual\nknowledge.” This is a major reason we chose to use ResearchCyc as the KB in these experiments as well."

      "heading" : "3.2 Solving Analogies with the word2vec DSVS",
      "text" : "Proportional analogies were introduced by Aristotle. In the 1980s and early 90s, researchers attempted to solve analogy problems using KBs. [11] suggested using the structure of concepts to find analogies, rather than the more obvious matching of relations. Unfortunately, as [13] pointed out, such structure is heavily dependent on the preconceptions inherent in the design of the knowledge base. The use of distributional semantic information was a breakthrough, allowing the system of [22] to score at human level on multiple-choice SAT analogy questions. The word2vec DSVS [16] uses an efficient method to build the vector space, allowing it to be created with hundreds of billions of words of training data. Except for this capability of using a larger training set and some well-chosen parameters, however, word2vec is essentially optimizing the same objective as the latent semantic analysis (LSA) approach to building semantic vectors.\nThe word2vec DSVS represents English words and phrases as points in a high-dimensional space. These points have the property that the relationship between two words is to some extent encoded by the vector between them. For example, the vector for “king” with the vector for “man” subtracted from it is a new vector encoding something about the difference between an ordinary man and a man who is a king. This can be thought of as a predicate relation we could call “royal” that maps “man” to “king:”\n(royal man ?X)⇒ X = king When applied to another term such as “woman,” this returns a vector near to the vector for “queen:” (royal woman ?X)⇒ X ≈ queen2 There are a few differences between predicates in a knowledge base and these relation vectors in the DSVS. First, each relation vector is only approximate. Some of them, such as the ones\n2The basic reason why word2vec is able to solve these kinds of analogies is explained clearly in [1].\nencoding royalty, plurality, or capital cities, are close approximations that are valid for most terms on which they are defined. Others, such as the ones encoding hypernyms, vary a lot from one term to another [17].\nA second difference is that a predicate can return zero, one, or many results, while a relation vector is limited to a single result. In some cases returning multiple near neighbors to the resultant vector gives useful results, but for other types of predicates the results have a different structure. For example, the hypernyms of a given term are not clustered together in semantic space but instead form a tree-like structure with the term at a leaf of the tree.\nFor these reasons, one cannot simply define a single vector, or even a tensor (a mapping from the full vector space into the same vector space) that represents a predicate correctly in many cases. However, assuming that each individual relation vector (representing a mapping between a term and one of its query results) is applicable to nearby semantic vectors, we can use relations that we know to be true to apply to nearby search terms to find their analogous results. This is making the assumption that predicate relation vectors form a kind of manifold, where the closer to the original term in semantic space, the more likely the relation will be accurate. In the case of one-to-many predicates, we will need to find a unique vector for each of the many search results and apply each to the new search term to get the corresponding result.\nWe used a version of the word2vec DSVS trained on over 100 billion words of text from Google News. This contains the most common million words and short phrases (up to three words) from the dataset. There was little preprocessing done on this data so words exist in both capitalized and commonly misspelled forms. (Such uses are usually very close semantically.) Each term or phrase is represented by a 300 dimensional vector.\nThe functions word2vec and vec2word map natural language words and phrases into the DSVS. If the phrase appears verbatim within the DSVS, word2vec returns that vector. If not, the vector returned is the average of the vectors for each of the words in the phrase individually (ignoring articles and the word “of”). This average has been shown to be semantically near\nto the relevant concept in the DSVS in many cases.3 The function vec2word returns the most similar words and phrases to a given vector in the DSVS. We use approximate nearest neighbors 4 to quickly find similar vectors to a given vector and return the associated word or phrase.\nIt is important to note that the DSVS may not have learned all the analogies which we would potentially like to make use of. Finding analogies between terms and their antonyms, for example, proved to be surprisingly difficult for word2vec."

      "heading" : "3.3 Using a KB with a DSVS",
      "text" : "In [16] the creators of word2vec write, “Our ongoing work shows that the word vectors can be successfully applied to automatic extension of facts in Knowledge Bases, and also for verification of correctness of existing facts.” They see the DSVS as being used as a resource to add assertions into knowledge bases and to verify existing assertions. The work described in this paper uses the DSVS for a similar purpose, but instead of asserting the facts directly, obtains them from the DSVS as needed. The disadvantage of this on-the-fly approach is that the assertions can’t be used as intermediate steps in the reasoning process. However, any fact whose only source is a DSVS is inherently uncertain, and this makes adding them directly to the KB problematic. Our approach uses hand-verified assertions throughout the reasoning process, and only at the end brings in analogical reasoning through the DSVS.\nThere has been some research into using semantic similarity to perform queries not just on the input terms but on similar terms as well. This can take place throughout the reasoning process and on the final results. A good survey of query expansion is [4]. The idea of using a DSVS to extend the capability of a KB as a query-KB semantic matching technique is explored in [10]. The approach described in this paper is similar, but the ability to make use of the analogy-forming properties of the DSVS (to map the results back into the context of the original search terms) allows it to answer many queries which would be impossible in these other systems.\nThere has been some exploration of how various relations are encoded into the DSVS. [17] for example, explores how hyponyms swarm around a term. The possibility has also been explored of reshaping a DSVS according to verified facts in [8]. One problem with doing this is that other relations, not explicitly included in such reshaping, may be distorted and so no longer have the analogical properties they had in the original DSVS. [23] also explores putting a knowledge graph (that is, a KB) into the space of a DSVS.\nUltimately, maintaining a KB and a DSVS separately does not seem to be the most elegant solution to the problem, however. Methods that create or modify a vector space from a KB directly allow the two to be combined in a single representation which could be used directly for both deductive and analogical reasoning. AnalogySpace, built from the large KB ConceptNet[20], is one such example. Knowledge graph embedding seems promising, especially when combined with knowledge extraction efforts such as KNEXT[19] and NELL[3]. At the moment, however, a KB still provides certain features these systems do not, such as making explicit the chain of reasoning to reach a conclusion."

Female names are often used in sentences together with the word ‘she’ in similar contexts, leading them to be mapped close together in the DSVS.

In the word2vec DSVS, the vector from term A (e.g. France) to its result B (Paris) can be applied to term A’ (England) to estimate its result B’ (London). By averaging several of these vectors, we can reduce noise and obtain a high-quality estimate.\nChoosing A as near as possible to A’ is expected to give the best results, since the contexts will be most similar and the vector between A and B most nearly parallel to the vector between A’ and B’. However, there will inevitably be noise in the context, and averaging more vectors together will tend to reduce this noise.

It may be the case, for example, that certain facts not asserted in the KB are less frequently encountered facts, in which case the DSVS is going to have a poorer estimate of those facts as well. The process also requires knowing what general type of answer is acceptable for the given predicate and term, in order to take the sample from which to build the estimate.6 In some cases, the restrictions the KB places on an argument are enough.

Similarly, the physical parts of a backhoe, a tractor, and so forth are found. Note that for some of these terms, the physical parts are derived using a chain of reasoning rather than asserted directly. For example, a #$WreckerTruck is a type of #$RoadVehicleInternalCombustionEngine, so parts like #$Piston and #$GasCap which are defined for the larger category are inherited by the particular machine. Because this part of the KB is very incomplete, #$Backhoe was not defined as a road vehicle, though #$Bulldozer was.\n7.

Depending on the amount of coverage the KB has in a particular area, the quality of the results can vary. For applications with some room for error or that can interact with a human to check results, having a list of possibilities with noise mixed in can be more useful than having no results at all. There is also the possibility of using Displacer itself to further narrow down the results, by checking, for example, the size or material of the purported parts."

      "text" : "The previous experiments showed how a DSVS can be used to extend the coverage and precision of a KB. In this experiment, we tested how a KB can be used to improve the analogical reasoning capability of a DSVS. In some cases, the relationship between the first two terms in a proportional analogy problem corresponds exactly to a predicate in a knowledge base. For example, in the analogy Paris : France :: London : X the predicate capitalCity encodes the relation between Paris and France we are looking for. When applied to the second half of the analogy (capitalCity ?X CityOfLondonEngland) The KB will correctly return England for X.\nWe can find such predicates using the following query in the Cyc KB: (and (and (assertedPredicateArg France 1 ?X) (assertedPredicateArg CityOfParisFrance 2 ?X)) (?X France CityOfParisFrance)) There are a few complications with this. First, there may be several possible terms in the KB corresponding to the natural language terms. (For example, there are at least 22 other cities in the world named Paris, not to mention Paris of Troy, Paris Hilton, a half dozen movies entitled Paris, etc...) Second, there may be more than one predicate relating such senses to each other: besides being the capital city of France, Paris is also a geographical subregion of France. To deal with these complications, we find all the potential predicates which satisfy (predicate France Paris) for any sense of France and Paris and apply them to all senses of the term London. This returns several potential answers. These answers are then tested to find which is closest to the answer vector obtained using the DSVS to solve the analogy. In this way, we find an answer which is both hand-curated (so more likely to be correct) and most likely in terms of distributional frequency.\nDedre Gentner called such matches with a predefined relation vector relating terms trivial, and felt that very few analogies would be captured by such relationships [11]. There are several other ways terms can be related in the knowledge base than those relationships captured by a single predicate. Another query pattern searches for two concepts and two predicates subject to certain constraints. In the analogy taking::took::running:ran, Cyc only can find the link between taking and took by linking both to the root word take. The predicates relating these terms to take are the same predicates relating running and ran to the root word run, so by searching for a pattern linking pairs of predicates to terms they have in common in this way we can find analogies of this type. Rearranging the roles played by the terms allows the system to also solve the analogy taking:running::took:ran. For these tests we use only a few of the simplest such patterns, as the search becomes more costly and the number of possible answers multiplies for more complex pattern-matching.\nWhen no such pattern can be matched, we can still make use of information in the KB to\nchoose the best answer from among the closest terms to the result vector in the DSVS. One simple way is by checking that the part-of-speech of the answer is correct. In nearly all four-term analogies, the part-of-speech of the fourth term either corresponds to the part-of-speech of the second term (in which case, the first and third terms should also have the same part-of-speech) or corresponds to the third term (in which case the first and second terms should have the same part-of-speech.) A similar relation should hold for singular or plural. 8\nWe tested analogy-finding ability on two test sets: the Semantic Syntactic Word Relationship test set introduced in [16] to test word2vec, and the SAT four-term analogy test set from (Turney, 2005)"

The natural language term with the minimum distance from this answer vector was used (as long as it was different from the three search terms.) For the KB alone condition, the KB was searched for results matching the analogy patterns discussed above. When the KB returned many results, an answer was chosen randomly from among the answers returned.\nFor the combined system, the answer returned by the KB closest to the answer vector of the DSVS was chosen."

The KB was unable to find matching patterns for many analogies in some categories, leading to a low score on opposites, superlatives, nationality, and family. In these cases, Displacer relied on the DSVS, only enforcing correct part-of-speech. For other predicates, the KB found too many potentially correct answers. Without a good way to judge between these for what the most natural answer should be, the system chose randomly between them, and only guessed the ground truth answer a small fraction of the time. This explains the low score for the KB on capitals, currency, and cities-in-states. In this case, Displacer found which of the potential answers returned by the KB was closest to the vector in the DSVS.\nThe KB has not explicitly been told the correct form for the part of speech for every word in English. Instead, it has rules to produce the form from the word root, and some exceptions, which don’t cover every case. Instead of the word sang, for example, the KB returned only the incorrect result singed. Because the KB can be unreliable in this way the system could be improved by flagging results where the KB result differed from the DSVS result. In general, when the same answer is obtained using both the KB and the DSVS it is likely to be correct, while if they are wildly different, the answer is suspect."
