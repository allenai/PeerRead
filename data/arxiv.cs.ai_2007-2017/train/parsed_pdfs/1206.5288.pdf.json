We likewise pursue this goal, and seek in addition to avoid reliance on direct truthful mechanisms. This reliance has at its core the Revelation Principle [Myerson, 1981], which states that the outcome of any given mechanism can still be achieved if we restrict the design space to mechanisms that induce truthful revelation of agent preferences. While theoretically sound, there have been criticisms of the principle on computational grounds, for example, those leveled by Conitzer and Sandholm [2003b]. It is also well recognized that if the design space is restricted in arbitrary ways, the revelation principle need not hold.",

At the core of our framework is a black-box optimization algorithm which guides the selection process of candidate mechanisms. Our approach yields optimal or nearly optimal mechanisms in several application domains using various objective functions. By comparing our results with known optimal mechanisms, and in some cases improving on the best known mechanisms, we provide evidence that ours is a promising approach to parametric design of indirect mechanisms.",
