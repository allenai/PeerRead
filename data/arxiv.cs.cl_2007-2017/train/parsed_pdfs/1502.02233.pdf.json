      "text" : "The autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a life-long neurodevelopmental disorder with poorly understood causes on the one hand, and a wide range of potential treatments supported by little evidence on the other. The disorder is characterized by severe impairments in social interaction, communication, and in some cases cognitive abilities. Considering the social and economic burden of ASD it is unsurprising that it has been attracting an increasing amount of research attention which has resulted in a rapid growth of the relevant corpus of literature. Navigating this vast amount of data by conventional, manual means is difficult and limiting; yet the rapid rise in the diagnosis rate of ASD demands timely research on its aetiology and treatment. Consequently, the potential benefit of tools based on novel data-mining and machine learning techniques is immense [1]. More meaningful ways for visualising or searching for data could provide invaluable information in clinical and administrative decision making as well as aid research, while automatic knowledge discovery would in its own right ar X iv :1\n50 2.\n02 23\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.I R\n] 8\nF eb\n2 01\nadvance the understanding of the underlying phenomena (e.g. epidemiological patterns). We describe a novel method which contributes towards this goal.\nMore specifically, we describe a general framework for the analysis of medical literature capable of (i) discovering the underlying topical structure, (ii) inferring the relationships between different discovered topics, and (iii) tracking the evolution of topics over time. The proposed framework uses the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) to extract topics automatically, and then constructs a similarity graph over them using an inter-topic similarity measure; topic evolution over time can be inferred from this graph. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on the specific example of a large longitudinal data corpus of medical literature on ASD which we collected. This corpus includes more than 18,000 articles published over the course of 42 years. In addition to the aforementioned technical contributions, our further contribution is this corpus which will be made public following the publication of the present paper.\nThe results we report on the collected ASD literature corpus illustrate the usefulness of our method and its ability to extract and track over time abstract topical knowledge, inferring the point at which a certain topic comes into existence, how its evolves, splits into multiple new topics or merges with the existing ones, and lastly when it ceases to exist. This is demonstrated on examples of well-known research directions in the field, making out work the first to examine the medical literature on ASD using advanced topic modelling tools. Our additional contributions come in the form of two free online tools which allow researchers to (i) navigate and search the literature in a semantically meaningful manner (see http://www.undersdtanfigutism.tk), and (ii) understand the development and relationships between different ideas which permeate research in the domain of ASD (see http://www.goo.gl/Ws7V64)."

      "heading" : "2.1 Latent topic models",
      "text" : "An important early topic modelling approach is the latent semantic indexing (LSI) [2] which remains popular. Two notable limitations of LSI are its inability to deal effectively with polysemy and to produce an explicit description of the latent space. A probabilistic improvement overcomes these by explicitly characterizing the latent space with semantic topics, and by employing a probabilistic generative model that addresses the polysemy problem [3]. Nevertheless, probabilistic LSI is prone to parameter overfitting caused by an uncontrolled growth in the number of parameters as the document corpus is increased. In addition, the necessary assignment of probabilities to documents is a nontrivial task [4].\nThe recently proposed latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) method [4] overcomes the overfitting problem by adopting a Bayesian framework and a generative process at the document level. While LDA has quickly become a standard tool for topic modelling, it too experiences challenges when applied on real-world data. In particular, being a parametric model the number of desired output topics has to be specified in advance. The HDP model as the nonparametric counterpart of LDA was introduced by Teh et al. [5] and addressed this limitation by using a Dirichlet process (DP) (as opposed to a Dirichlet distribution) as the prior on topics. Therefore, each document is modelled using an infinite mixture model, allowing the data to inform the complexity of the model and infer the number of resulting topics automatically. We discuss this model in further detail in Section 3.\nTemporal topic modelling A notable limitation of most models described in the existing literature lies in their assumption that the data corpus is static; this includes those based on LDA mentioned previously, or the hierarchical Dirichlet process described in detail in the next section. However, in many practical applications documents are added to the corpus in a temporal manner and their ordering has significance (non-exchangeability property). As a consequence, the topical structure of the corpus changes over time. The assumption made by all previous work, and indeed adopted by us, is that documents are not exchangeable at large temporal scales but are at short time scales, thus treating the corpus at temporally locally static.\nThe existing work on temporal topic modelling can be divided into two groups of approaches both of which can be based on parametric [6,7,8] or nonparametric [9,10] techniques, the former suffering from the limitation that they contain free parameters which must be set a priori. Methods of the first group discretize time into epochs, apply a static topic model to each epoch, and by making the Markovian assumption relate the parameters of each epoch’s topic model to those of the epochs adjacent to it in time [6,7,9,10]. While the approach we propose in this paper adopts the idea of time discretization, it diverges in its other features from this group of methods thereafter. In particular, instead of employing the Markovian assumption we describe a novel structure in form of a temporal similarity graph, which gives our method greater flexibility, as described in detail in the next section. The second group of methods in the literature regard document time-stamps as observations of a continuous random variable [8,11]. This assumption severely limits the type of topic changes which can be described. For example, as opposed to our model, these models are not capable of describing the evolution of topics, or their splitting and merging, and are rather constrained to tracking simple topic popularity (rise/fall)."

      "heading" : "2.2 Biomedical text mining",
      "text" : "Most previous work on text-based knowledge discovery has rather focused on (i) the tagging of names of entities such as genes, proteins, and diseases [12], (ii) the discovery of relationships between different entities e.g. functional associations\nbetween genes [13], or (iii) the extraction of information pertaining to events such as gene expression or protein binding [14].\nThe idea that the medical literature could be mined for new knowledge is typically attributed to Swanson [15]. For example by manually examining medical literature databases he hypothesised that dietary fish oil could be beneficial for Raynaud’s syndrome patients, which was later confirmed by experimental evidence. Work that followed sought to develop statistical methods which would make this process automatic. Most approaches adopted the use of term frequencies and co-occurrences using dictionaries such as Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) [16].\nMost existing work on biomedical knowledge discovery is based on what may be described as traditional data mining techniques (neural networks, support vector machines etc); comprehensive surveys can be found in [17,14]. The application of state-of-the-art Bayesian methods in this domain is scarce. Amongst the notable exceptions is the work by Blei et al. who showed how latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) can be used to facilitate the process of hypothesis generation in the context of genetics [18]. Arnold et al. used a similar approach to demonstrate that abstract topic space representation is effective in patient-specific case retrieval [19]. In their later work they introduced a temporal model which learns topic trends and showed that the inferred topics and their temporal patterns correlate with valid clinical events and their sequences [20]. Wu et al. used LDA for gene-drug relationship ranking [21]."

      "heading" : "3.1 Hierarchical Dirichlet process mixture models",
      "text" : "The Dirichlet process is a useful prior for mixture modelling which allows a document collection to accommodate a potentially infinite number of topics. It is the building block of Bayesian nonparametric methods. A Dirichlet process [22] DP (γ,H) is defined as a distribution of a random probability measure G over a measure space (Θ,B, µ), such that for any finite measurable partition (A1, A2, . . . , Ar) of Θ the random vector (G (A1) , . . . , G (Ar)) is a Dirichlet distribution with parameters (γH (A1) , . . . , γH (Ar)). An alternative view of the DP emerges from the so-called stick-breaking process which adopts a constructive approach using a sequence of discrete draws [23]. Specifically, if G ∼ DP (γ,H) then G = ∑∞ k=1 βkδφk where φk\niid∼ H and β = (βk)∞k=1 is the vector of weights obtained as βk = vk ∏k−1 l=1 (1− vl) and vl\niid∼ Beta (1, γ). Owing to the discrete nature and infinite dimensionality of its draws, the DP is a highly useful prior for Bayesian mixture models. By associating different\nmixture components with atoms φk of the stick-breaking process, and assuming xi|φk\niid∼ F (xi|φk) where F (.) is the likelihood kernel of the mixing components, we can formulate the Dirichlet process mixture model (DPM). The DPM is suitable for nonparametric clustering of exchangeable data in a single group e.g. words in a document where the DPM models the underlying structure of the document with potentially an infinite number of topics. However, many realworld problems are more appropriately modelled as comprising multiple groups of exchangeable data (e.g. a collection of documents). In such cases it is usually desirable to model the observations of different groups jointly, allowing them to share their generative clusters. This idea is known as the sharing statistical strength and is achieved using a hierarchical structure.\nAmongst different ways of linking group-level DPMs, HDP [5] offers an interesting solution whereby base measures of document-level DPs are drawn from another DP. In this way the atoms of the corpus-level DP (i.e. topics in our case) are shared across the corpus. Formally, if x = {x1, . . . ,xJ} is a document collection where xj = { xj1, . . . , xjNj } is the j-th document comprising Nj words, each document is modelled with a DPM Gj |α0, G0 iid∼ DP (α0, G0) where its DP prior is further endowed by another DP G0|γ,H ∼ DP (γ,H). This is illustrated schematically in Figure 1a. Since the base measure of Gj is drawn from G0, it takes the same support as G0. Also the parameters of the group-level mixture components, θji, share their values with the corpus-level DP support on {φ1, φ2, . . .}. Therefore Gj can be equivalently expressed using the stick-breaking process as Gj = ∑∞ k=1 πjkδφk where πj |α0, γ ∼ DP (α0, γ)[5]. The posterior for θji has been shown to follow a Chinese restaurant franchise process which can be used to develop inference algorithms based on Gibbs sampling [5]."

      "text" : "In this section we show how the described HDP-based model can be applied to the analysis of temporal topic changes in a longitudinal data corpus. We begin by dividing the literature corpus by time into multiple epochs. Each epoch is then modelled separately using an HDP. Different epochs’ models are inferred using the same initial corpus-level base measure and hyperparameters. Hence if n is the number of epochs, we obtain n sets of topics θ = {θt1 , . . . ,θtn} where θt = {θ1,t, . . . , θKt,t} is the set of topics that describe epoch t, and Kt their number (which is inferred automatically, as described previously). This is illustrated in Figure 1b. In the next section we describe how given an inter-topic similarity measure the evolution of different topics across epochs can be tracked."
    }, {
      "heading" : "3.3 Measuring topic similarity",
      "text" : "Our goal now is to track changes in the topical structure of a data corpus over time. The simplest changes of interest include the emergence of new topics, and the disappearance of others. More subtly, we are also interested in how a specific topic changes – how it evolves over time in terms of the contributions of different words it comprises, as well as how it splits into new topics or merges\nwith the existing ones. Clearly this information can provide valuable insight into the refinement of ideas and findings in the scientific community, effected by new research and accumulating evidence.\nThe key idea behind our approach stems from the observation that while topics may change significantly over time, by their very nature the change between successive epochs is limited. Therefore we infer the continuity of a topic in one epoch by relating it to all topics in the immediately subsequent epoch which are sufficiently similar to it under some similarity measure. This can be seen to lead naturally to a similarity graph representation whose nodes correspond to topics and whose edges link those topics in two epochs which are related. Formally, the weight of the directed edge that links φj,t , the j-th topic in epoch t, and φk,t+1 is set equal to ρ (φj,t, φk,t+1) where ρ is an appropriate similarity measure. Given that in our HDP-based model each topic is represented by a probability distribution, suitable similarity metrics include the Jaccard similarity, the Jenson-Shannon divergence, or the L2-norm for example.\nA conceptual illustration of a similarity graph is shown in Figure 2a. It shows three consecutive time epochs t − 1, t, and t + 1 and a selection of topics in these epochs. Graph edge weight i.e. inter-topic similarity is encoded by varying the thickness of the corresponding line connecting two nodes – a thicker line signifies more similar topics. We use a threshold to eliminate automatically weak edges, retaining only the edges which correspond to sufficiently similar topics in adjacent epochs. It can be seen that this readily allows us to detect the disappearance of a particular topic, the emergence of new topics, as well as the splitting or merging of different topics:\nEmergence If a node does not have any edges incident to it, the corresponding topic is taken as having emerged in the associated epoch (e.g. φj+2 at time t in Figure 2a).\nDisappearance If no edges originate from a node, the corresponding topic is taken to vanish in the associated epoch (e.g. φj at time t in Figure 2a).\nSplitting If more than a single edge originates from a node, the corresponding topic is understood as being split into multiple topics in the next epoch (e.g. φi is split into φj and φj+1 in Figure 2a).\nMerging If more than a single edge is incident to a node, the topics of the nodes from which the edges originate are understood as having merged together to form a new topic (e.g. φi and φi+1 merge to form φj+1 in Figure 2a)."

We assumed a paper is related to ASD if the term “autism” is present in its title or abstract, and collected only papers written in English. The earliest publication fitting our criteria is that by Kanner [24], and we collected all matching publications up to the final one indexed by PubMed on 24th July 2014, yielding a corpus of 20,138 publications. We discarded the 1,946 which do not have an abstract indexed, ending with the total of 18,192 papers in our dataset. We used the abstracts text to evaluate our method.\nData pre-processing Following the standard practice in text processing literature we applied soft lemmatization on the abstracts in our dataset, using the freely available WordNet tool [25]. No stemming was performed to avoid potential distortion of words which is sometimes effected by heuristic rules used by stemming algorithms. After lemmatization and the removal of so-called stop words, we obtained 1.9 million terms in the entire corpus when repetitions are counted, and 37,278 unique terms. We construct the vocabulary for our method by selecting the subset of the most frequent unique terms which explain 90% of the energy of the corpus, which resulted in a 3,738 term vocabulary."

Notice the exponential rise in the number of topics which mirrors the exponential increase in the number of publications over time in our dataset. This increasing interest in ASD can be illustrated by the observation that in 2013 there are five times as many publications as in 2000. For our inter-topic similarity described in Section 3.3 we adopted the use of the well-known Jaccard similarity; this similarity measure was used to obtain all results reported in this section.

      "text" : "While the exact aetiology of the ASD is still poorly understood, the existence of a significant genetic component is beyond doubt [26]. Work on understanding complex genetic factors affecting the development of autism, which possibly involve multiple genes which interact with each other and the environment, is a major theme of research and as such a good case study on which the usefulness of the proposed method can be illustrated.\nWe started by identifying the topic of interest as that with the highest probability of the terms “gene” or “genetic” conditioned on the topic, and tracing it back in time to the epoch in which it originated. This led to the discovery of the relevant topic in the epoch spanning the period 1986–1991. Figure 4 shows the evolution of this topic from 1992 revealed by our method (due to space constraints only the most significant parts of the similarity graph are shown; minor\nchanges to the topic before 1992 are also omitted for clarity, as indicated by the dotted line in the figure). Each topic is labelled with its first few dominant terms. The following interpretation of our findings is readily apparent. Firstly, in the period 1992–1997, the topic is rather general in nature. Over time it evolves and splits into topics which concern more specific concepts (recall that such splitting of topics cannot be captured by any of the existing methods). For example by the epoch 2002–2007 the single original topic has evolved and split into four topics which concern:\n– the relationship between mutations in the gene mecp2 (essential for normal functioning of neurone), and mental disorders and epilepsy (it is estimated that one third of ASD individuals also have epilepsy),\n– gene alternations, for example the duplication of 15q11–13 and deletion of 16p11.2 both of which are associated with ASD,\n– genetic linkage association analysis and heritability of autism, and\n– observational work on autistic twins and probands with siblings on the spectrum.\nOur framework also allows us to look ‘back’ in time. For example, by examining the topics that the 1992 genetics topic originate from we discovered that the topic evolved from the early concept of “infantile ASD” [24]."

      "heading" : "4.4 Case study 2: ASD and vaccination",
      "text" : "For our second case study we chose to examine research on the relationship between ASD development and vaccination. This subject has attracted much attention both in the research community, as well as in the media and the general public. The controversy was created with the publication of the work by Wakefield [27] which reported epidemiological findings linking MMR vaccination and the development of autism and colitis. Despite the full retraction of the article following the discovery that it was fraudulent, and numerous subsequent studies who failed to show the claimed link, a significant portion of the general public remains concerned with the issue.\nAs in the previous example, we begun by identifying the topic with the highest probability of the terms “vaccine” and “vaccination” conditioned on the topic, and tracing it back to the epoch in which it first emerged. Again, a single topic was readily identified, in the epoch spanning the period 1996–2001. Notice that this is consistent with the publication date of the first relevant publication by Wakefield [27]. The evolution of the topic is illustrated in Figure 5 in the same way as in the previous section. It can be seen that the original topic concerned the subjects initially brought to attention such as “measles”, “vaccine”, and “autism”. In the subsequent epoch, when the original claim was still thought to have credibility, the topic evolves and splits into numerous others mirroring research directions taken by various researchers. Following this period and the revelations of its fraudulence, the topic assumes mainly single-threaded evolution, at times incorporating various originally separate ideas. For example observe the independent emergence of the term “mercury”. Though initially unrelated to it this topic merges with the topic that concerns vaccination which can be explained by the widely publicized thiomersal (vaccine preservative) controversy (again note that such merging of topics cannot be captured by the existing methods). Al-\nthough rejected by the medical community due to a lack of evidence, this topic can be seen as persisting to date."

In contrast to previous work our model does not impose a prior on the rate at which documents are added to the corpus nor does it adopt the Markovian assumption which overly restricts the type of changes that the model can capture. Our key technical contribution is a framework based on (i) discretization of time into epochs, (ii) epoch-wise topic discovery using a hierarchical Dirichlet process-based model, and (iii) a temporal similarity graph which allows for the modelling of complex topic changes: emergence and disappearance, evolution, and splitting and merging. The power of the proposed framework is demonstrated on the medical literature corpus concerned with the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) – an increasingly important research subject of significant social and healthcare importance. In addition to the collected ASD literature corpus which we will make freely available, our contributions also include two free online tools we built as aids to ASD researchers. These can be used for semantically meaningful navigation and searching, as well as knowledge discovery from this large and rapidly growing corpus of literature.",
