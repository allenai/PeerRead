      "heading" : "Introduction",
      "text" : "The well known \"layer cake\" diagram (Berners-Lee 2004) outlines a high level agenda for work on the Semantic Web.\n2 There is much current work in progress under the heading of \"Semantics\", as in the interleaving of metadata with data in RDF or OWL, stemming from (Berners-Lee et al, 2001). Such work fits into the layers from XML to Ontology in Figure 1. It may be useful to think of this as \"data semantics\", or \"Semantics1\". In the diagram, there are boxes labeled Rule, Unifying Logic, Proof and Trust, User Interface and Applications. This paper describes one way of meeting some of the requirements indicated by those boxes, with an online system that combines Semantics1 with two further kinds of meaning. Semantics2 specifies what conclusions a reasoning engine should be able to infer from any set of rules and facts (Walker 1993), using a logical model theory (Apt et al 1988) that takes into account the semantics under which databases are used in practice. Semantics3 concerns the meaning of English concepts at the author- and user-interface. The design of the system described here rests on making Semantics1, 2, and 3 work together. Adding and integrating these semantic dimensions has the potential not only to support aspects of the Semantic Web, but also to ease some significant problems in commercial IT. According to (Forrester 2005) : Aligning IT strategy with business strategy has been one of the top three issues confronting IT and business executives for more than 20 years. Polling of CIOs and business executives conducted in 2004 revealed that aligning IT and business goals remains their No. 1 or 2 priority. As one way of addressing the problem, this paper shows how to support the writing and running of applications as rules in open vocabulary, executable English. The system that does this takes a lightweight approach to English, backed by an inference engine that assigns a highly declarative meaning to a set of rules. The system accepts rules in English, and small numbers of RDF or relational facts, typed or copy-pasted directly into a browser. For larger amounts of data, the system uses information in the rules to automatically generate and run SQL over networked databases. From a few rules, the system typically generates SQL that would be too complicated to write reliably by hand. However, the system can explain its results in step-by-step hypertexted English, at the business or scientific level. From the point of view of a person writing and running rules, the system is simply a browser, used actively rather than for passive browsing. Thus, the system functions as a kind of Wiki for executable English content. Here are some examples."

      "heading" : "A Semantic Resolution Example",
      "text" : "The paper (Peng et al 2002) describes an example of name resolution for e-commerce, using three namespaces: retailer, manufacturer, and shared. In the example, a retailer orders computers from a manufacturer. However, in the retailer's terminology, a computer is called a PC for Gamers, while in the manufacturer's terminology, it is called a Prof Desktop.\n3\nThe rule says that, if the two premises above the line are true, then so is the conclusion. In the rule, \"some-item1\", \"that-class\" and so on are place holders, or variables, that will be filled in with actual values, such as \"PC for Gamers\" and \"Computers\" when the rule is run. Apart from the place holders, the rest of the words in the rule are in open vocabulary, open syntax, English. So, the rule defines the meaning of the last sentence in terms of the meanings of the first two. To avoid infinite regress, this process stops at the headings of data tables. The headings are similar sentences, and the number of place holders in a heading is the number of columns in the table. To view and run the example, one can point a browser to (Reeng 2006) and select SemanticResolution1."

An explanation always starts out with the general justification of an answer, and provides hyperlinks so that one can drill down into more detail as needed. In particular, we could write additional rules so that a rather technical, RDF-based explanation step is preceded by something more suitable for an end user to read.

      "heading" : "System Design",
      "text" : "In any system designed to answer English questions, we need a way of showing users what kinds of questions can reasonably be asked. If we load some oil industry rules into the system, we do not want a user to ask about bioinformatics ontologies. The current system guides a user by showing a menu consisting of generalized versions of the sentences that were used in writing the rules for a particular task. At the top of the menu, the system shows a group of sentences that are not used as premises in any rules. These correspond to generalized versions of the most important questions that the application can answer. Next, the system shows sentences that were used as premises for the top group, and so on. A user can select a sentence directly from the menu. Alternatively, she can type in an arbitrary English sentence, in which case the system will use a form of conventional information retrieval to bring relevant rule conclusions to the top of the menu. Once a user has selected a generalized sentence to use as a question, she can specialize it using automatically generated submenus. This can be done by replacing \"some-name\" with \"Fred\", or making a range restriction, or asking for an approximate match. For a person writing rules, the vocabulary is open, and so, to a large extent, is the English syntax. In contrast to most natural language systems, there is no dictionary or grammar of English to be maintained. As such, the support for English is lightweight, but this has a practical advantage -- someone writing rules can freely use jargon, acronyms, words not in any dictionary, ungrammatical\n8 sentences, mathematical notations and so on. The price for this is, if an author wishes the system to regard two sentences as the same, she must write rules that say so. An advantage is that the English semantics are strict – a sentence means exactly what it says (in context), and nothing else. Although the vocabulary is open as far as the system is concerned, one can write a collection of rules and facts that defines a controlled vocabulary. While there is no dictionary or grammar of English, the system does contain a grammar that recognizes rules and tables of data. So, if an author types in a simple rule that does not consist of one or more sentences, followed by an underline, followed by a single sentence, the system responds with a warning. Also, the underlying rule syntax requires that each place holder (or variable) that appears in a conclusion of a rule should also appear in simple premise of the same rule. Similarly, if a sentence is negated (as in the Bioinformatics Ontology Example), the system requires that each of the variables in the sentence should be mentioned in earlier simple premises. There is further checking to ensure that it is not possible for the conclusion of a rule to depend on a negation of itself, even if that happens through a chain of other rules. Should that happen, the system shows the rules concerned, together with a warning. The lightweight English -- Semantics3 -- is supported by an inference method that assigns a strongly non-procedural meaning to the rules -- Semantics2 -- (Apt et al 1988). The inference method used is based on that in (Walker 1993). The method switches automatically between forward and backward execution of the rules. The non-procedural approach is necessary, because an English sentence must keep the same declarative meaning regardless of where it appears sequentially in a collection of rules, and regardless of changes to rules in which the sentence does not appear. For authors who are not programmers, this approach has the advantage that the answers one gets from a set of rules and facts do not depend on the textual sequence in which the rules appear. This is in contrast to a procedural reading, in which a collection of N rules potentially has factorial(N) different meanings, corresponding to different permutations of the rule sequence."

There is an online system for this -- a kind of Wiki for rules in open vocabulary, executable English.

Similarly, there is the potential for the approach to address the significant economic problem of business-IT alignment."
