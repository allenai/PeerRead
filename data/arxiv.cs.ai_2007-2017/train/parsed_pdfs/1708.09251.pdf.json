INTRODUCTION\nSearching for high-quality solutions within a typically highdimensional search space is an important part of engineering and research. Intensive work has been done in recent decades to produce automated procedures to generate these solutions, which are commonly called “Optimization Algorithms”. The applications of such algorithms are numerous and range from modeling purposes to product design [1]. More recently, optimization algorithms have become the core of most machine learning techniques. For example, they are used to adjust the weights of neural networks in order to minimize the classification error [2], [3], or to allow robots to learn new behaviors that maximize their velocity or accuracy [4], [5].\nInspired by the ability of natural evolution to generate species that are well adapted to their environment, Evolutionary Computation has a long history in the domain of optimization, particularly in stochastic optimization [6]. For example, evolutionary methods have been used to optimize the morphologies and the neural networks of physical robots [7], and to infer the equations behind collected data [8]. These optimization abilities are also the core of Evolutionary Robotics in which\nA. Cully and Y. Demiris are with the Personal Robotics Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Imperial College London, U.K. (e-mail: a.cully@imperial.ac.uk; y.demiris@imperial.ac.uk).\nevolutionary algorithms are used to generate neural networks, robot behaviors, or objects [9], [10].\nHowever, from a more general perspective and in contrast with Artificial Evolution, Natural Evolution does not produce one effective solution but rather an impressively large set of different organisms, all well adapted to their respective environment. Surprisingly, this divergent search aspect of Natural Evolution is rarely considered in engineering and research fields, even though the ability to provide a large and diverse set of high-performing solutions appears to be promising for multiple reasons.\nFor example, in a set of effective solutions, each provides an alternative in the case that one solution turns out to be less effective than expected. This can happen when the optimization process takes place in simulation, and the obtained result does not transfer well to reality (a phenomenon called the reality gap [11]). In this case, a large collection of solutions can quickly provide a working solution [4]. Maintaining multiple solutions and using them concurrently to generate actions or predict actions when done by other agents has also been shown to be very successful in bioinspired motor control and cognitive robotics experiments[12].\nMoreover, most artificial agents, like robots, should be able to exhibit different types of behavior in order to accomplish their mission. For example, a walking robot needs to be able to move not only forwards, but in every direction and at different speeds, in order to properly navigate in its environment. Similarly, a robotic arm needs to be able to reach objects at different locations rather than at a single, predefined target. Despite this observation, most optimization techniques that are employed to learn behaviors output only a single solution:\nar X\niv :1\n70 8.\n09 25\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.N E\n] 1\n2 M\nay 2\n01 7\n2 the one which maximizes the optimized function [10], [7], [5]. Learning generic controllers that are able to solve several tasks is particularly challenging, as it requires testing each solution on several scenarios to assess their quality [13]. The automatic creation of a collection of behaviors is likely to overcome these limitations and will make artificial agents more versatile.\nThe diversity of the solutions could also be beneficial for the optimization process itself. The exploration process may find, within the diversity of the solutions, stepping stones that allow the algorithm to find even higher-performing solutions. Similarly, the algorithms may be able to solve a given problem faster if they can rely on solutions that have been designed for different but related situations. For example, modifying an existing car design to make it lighter might be faster than inventing a completely new design.\nAttracted by these different properties several recent works, such as Novelty Search with Local Competition [14] and the MAP-Elites algorithm [15], started to investigate the question of generating large collections of both diverse and highperforming solutions. Pugh et al. [16], [17] nicely named this question as the Quality-Diversity (QD) challenge.\nAfter a brief description of the origins of QD-algorithms in the next section, we unify these algorithms into a single modular framework, which opens new directions to create QD-algorithms that combine the advantages of existing methods (see section III). Moreover, we introduce a new QDalgorithm based on this framework that outperforms the existing approaches by using a new selective pressure, named the “curiosity score”. We also introduce a new archive management approach for unstructured archives, like the novelty archive [18]. The performance of these contributions is assessed via an extensive experimental comparison involving numerous variants of QD-algorithms (see section IV). After the conclusion, we introduce the open-source library designed for this study, which can be openly used by interested readers (see section VI)."

      "text" : "This challenge was first addressed by multimodal function optimization algorithms, including niching methods in Evolutionary Computation [19], [20], [21], which aim to find the local optima of a function. These algorithms mainly involve niche and genotypic diversity preservation mechanisms [21], like clustering [22] and clearing [23] methods.\nHowever, in many applications, some interesting solutions are not captured by the local-optima of the fitness function. For example, it is important for walking robots to be able to control the walking speeds, however, there is no guarantee that the performance function (i.e., the walking speed [24], [25]) will show local-optima that are diverse enough to provide a complete range of walking speeds. Typically, if the optimized function is mono-modal (i.e., without local-optima), the population would\ntend to the global-optimum and the diversity of the produced walking behaviors will not be enough to properly control the robot. For instance, it will not contain slow behaviors, which are essential for the robot’s manoeuvrability. This example illustrates that sampling the entire range of possible solutions is not always related to searching for the local optima, and why it may be useful to have the diversity preservation mechanism not correlated with the performance function, but rather based on differences in the solution type."

      "heading" : "B. Searching for Diverse Solutions",
      "text" : "Following this idea of a non performance-based diversity mechanism, the Novelty Search algorithm [18] introduces the idea of searching for solutions that are different from the previous ones, without considering their quality. This concept is applied by optimizing a “novelty score” that characterizes the difference of a solution compared to those already encountered, which are stored in a “novelty archive”. The novelty archive is independent from the population of the evolutionary algorithm. The novelty score is computed as the average distance of the k-nearest neighboring solutions that currently are in the novelty archive, while the distances are computed according to a user-defined solution descriptor (also called a behavioral characterization, or behavioral descriptor [18], [13]). When the novelty score of a solution exceeds a pre-defined threshold, this solution is added to the archive and thus used to compute the novelty score of future solutions.\nThe main hypothesis behind this approach is that, in some cases, the optimal solutions cannot be found by simply maximizing the objective function. This is because the algorithm first needs to find stepping stones that are ineffective according to the objective function, but lead to promising solutions afterwards. A good illustration of this problem is the “deceptive maze” [18] in which following the objective function inevitably leads to a dead-end (a local extremum). The algorithm has to investigate solutions that lead the agent further from the goal before being able to find solutions that actually solve the task.\nThe authors of Novelty Search also introduced the “Novelty Search with Local Competition” algorithm (NSLC) [14], in which the exploration focuses on solutions that are both novel (according to the novelty score) and locally high-performing. The main insight consists of comparing the performance of a solution only to those that are close in the descriptor space. This is achieved with a “local quality score” that is defined as the number of the k-nearest neighboring solutions in the novelty archive with a lower performance (e.g., slower walking speed [14]) than the considered solution. The exploration is then achieved with a multi-objective optimization algorithm (e.g., NSGA-II [26]) that optimizes both the novelty and local quality scores of the solutions. However, the local quality score does not influence the threshold used to select whether an individual is added to the novelty archive. The final result of NSLC is the population of the optimization algorithm, which contains solutions that are both novel and high-performing compared to other local solutions. In other words, the population gathers solutions that are both different from those saved in the novelty archive, and high-performing when compared to similar types of solutions.\n3 The first applications of NSLC consisted of evolving both the morphology and the behavior of virtual creatures in order to generate a population containing diverse species, ranging from slow and massive quadrupeds to fast and lightweight unipedal hoppers by comparing velocity only between similar species [14]. In this experiment, the solution descriptor was defined as the height, the mass and the number of active joints, while the quality of the solutions was governed by their walking speed. At the end of the evolutionary process, the population contained 1,000 different species. These results represent the very first step in the direction of generating a collection of diverse and high-performing solutions covering a significant part of the spectrum of possibilities."

      "text" : "Instead of considering the population of NSLC as the result of the algorithms, Cully et al. [13] suggested to consider the novelty archive as the result. Indeed, the aim of the novelty archive is to keep track of the different solution types that are encountered during the process, and thus to cover as much as possible of the entire descriptor space. Therefore, the novelty archive can be considered as a collection of diverse solutions on its own. However, the solutions are stored in the collection without considering their quality: as soon as a new type of solution is found, it is added to archive. While this procedure allows the archive to cover the entire spectrum of the possible solutions, in the original version of NSLC only the first encountered solution of each type is added to the archive. This implies that when finding a better solution for a solution type already present in the archive, this solution is not added to the archive. This mechanism prevents the archive from improving over time.\nBased on this observation, a variant of NSLC, named “Behavioral Repertoire Evolution”(BR-Evolution [13]), has been introduced to progressively improve the archive’s quality by replacing the solutions that are kept in the archive with better ones as soon as they are found. This approach has been applied to generate “Behavioral Repertoires” in robotics, which consists of a large collection of diverse, but effective, behaviors for a robotic agent in a single run of an evolutionary algorithm. It has also been used to produce collections of walking gaits, allowing a virtual six-legged robot to walk in every direction and at different speeds. The descriptor space is defined as the final position of the robot after walking for 3 seconds, while the quality score corresponds to an orientation error. As we reproduce this experiment in this paper, we provide additional descriptions and technical details in section IV-C.\nThe concepts introduced with BR-Evolution have also later been employed in the Novelty-based Evolutionary Babbling (Nov-EB) [27] that allows a robot to autonomously discover the possible interactions with objects in its environment. This work draws a first link between the QD-algorithms and the domain of developmental robotics, which is also studied in several other works (see [28] for overview).\nOne of the main results that has been demonstrated with BREvolution experiments is that this algorithm is able to generate an effective collection of behaviors several times faster than by\noptimizing each solution independently (at least 5 times faster and about 10 times more accurate [13]). By “recycling” and improving solutions that are usually discarded by traditional evolutionary algorithms, the algorithm is able to quickly find necessary stepping stones. This observation correlates with the earlier presented hypothesis that QD-algorithms are likely to benefit from the diversity contained in the collection to improve their optimization and exploration abilities.\nHowever, it has been noticed that the archive improvement mechanism may “erode” the borders and alter the coverage of the collection [29]. Indeed, there are cases where the new, and better, solution found by the algorithm is less novel than the one it will replace in the archive. For instance, if high-performance can be more easily achieved for a solution in the middle of the descriptor space, then it is likely that the solutions near the borders will progressively be replaced by slightly better, but less novel, solutions. In addition to eroding the borders of the collection, this phenomenon will also increase the density of solutions in regions with a high performance. For instance, this phenomenon has been observed in the generation of collections containing different walking and turning gaits [29]. The novelty archive of the original NSLC algorithm had a better coverage of the descriptor space (but with lower performance scores) than the one from the BR-Evolution, because it is easier for the algorithms to find solutions that make the robot walk slowly rather than solutions that make it walk fast or execute complex turning trajectories (In section III-A2 of this paper, we introduce a new archive management mechanism that overcomes these erosion issues)."

      "text" : "Following different inspirations from the works presented above, the Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites (MAP-Elites) algorithm [15] has been recently introduced. While this algorithm was first designed to “illuminate” the landscape of objective functions [30], it showed itself to be an effective algorithm to generate a collection of solutions that are both diverse and high-performing. The main difference with NSLC and BR-Evolution is that, in MAP-Elites, the population of the algorithms is the collection itself, and the selection, mutations and preservation mechanisms directly consider the solutions that are stored in the collection.\nIn MAP-Elites, the descriptor space is discretized and represented as a grid. Initially, this grid is empty and the algorithm starts with a randomly generated set of solutions. After evaluating each solution and recording its associated descriptor, these solutions are potentially added to the corresponding grid cells. If the cell is empty, then the solution is added to the grid, otherwise, only the best solution among the new one and the one already in the grid is kept. After the initialization, a solution is randomly selected via a uniform distribution among those in the grid, and is mutated. The new solution obtained after the mutation is then evaluated and fitted back in the grid following the same procedure as in the initialization. This selection/mutation/evaluation loop is repeated several millions times, which progressively improves the coverage and the quality of the collection.\n4 In one of its first applications, MAP-Elites was used to generate a large collection of different but effective ways to walk in a straight line by using differently the legs of a six-legged robot. This collection of behaviors was then used to allow the robot to quickly adapt to unforeseen damage conditions by selecting a new walking gait that still works in spite of the situation [4]. The same algorithm has also been used to generate behavioral repertoires containing turning gaits, similarly to the work described previously, and it was shown that MAP-Elites generates better behavior collections while being faster than the BR-Evolution algorithm [31].\nThe behaviors contained in these collections can be seen as locomotion primitives and thus can be combined to produce complex behaviors. Following this idea, the Evolutionary Repertoire-Based Control (EvoRBC [32]) evolves a neural network, called the “arbitrator”, that selects the appropriate behavior in the repertoire, which was previously generated with MAP-Elites. This approach has been applied on a four-wheeled steering robot that has to solve a navigation task through a maze composed of several sharp angles, and a foraging task in which the robots needs to collect and consume as many objects as possible.\nThese applications take advantage of the non-linear dimensionality reduction provided by MAP-Elites. Indeed, both applications select behaviors from the descriptor space, which is composed of fewer than a dozen of dimensions (respectively, 36 to 6 dimensions [4] and 8 to 2 dimensions [32]), while the parameter space often consists of several dozen dimensions. MAP-Elites has been employed in several other applications, including the generation of different morphologies of soft robots [15], or the production of images that are able to fool deep neural networks [33]. It has also been used to create “innovation engines” that are able to autonomously synthesize pictures that resemble to actual objects (e.g., television, bagel, strawberry) [34].\nHowever, the obligation to discretize the descriptor space may be limiting for some applications, and the uniform random selection may not be suitable for particularly large collections, as it dilutes the selection pressure. Indeed, the uniform random selection of individuals among the collection makes the selection pressure inversely proportional to the number of solutions actually contained in the collection. A simple way to mitigate this limitation is to use a biased selection according to the solution performance or according to its novelty score (like introduced by Pugh et al. [16], [17]). Another direction consists in having a number of cells irrespective of the dimensionality descriptor space, for example by using computational geometry to uniformly partition the high-dimensional descriptor space into a pre-defined number of regions [35], or by using Hierarchical Spatial Partitioning [36]."

[16], [17], we can outline a common definition:\nDefinition II.1: Quality-Diversity optimization\nA Quality-Diversity optimization algorithm aims to produce a large collection of solutions that are both as diverse and high-performing as possible, which covers a particular domain, called the descriptor space.\nWhile this definition is shared with the existing literature, we also stress the importance of the coverage regularity of the produced collections. In the vast majority of the applications presented previously, not only is the coverage of importance but its uniformity is as well. For example, in the locomotion tasks, an even coverage of all possible turning abilities of the robot is required to allow the execution of arbitrary trajectories [29].\nBased on this definition, the overall performance of a QDalgorithm is defined by the quality of the produced collection of solutions according to three criteria:\n1) the coverage of the descriptor space; 2) the uniformity of the coverage; and 3) the performance of the solution found for each type."

      "heading" : "F. Understanding the Underlying Mechanisms",
      "text" : "In addition to direct applications, several other works focus on studying the properties of QD-algorithms. For example, Lehman et al. [37] revealed that extinction events (i.e., erasing a significant part of the collection) increases the evolvability of the solutions [38] and allow the process to find higherperforming solutions afterwards. For example, with MAP-Elites, erasing the entire collection except 10 solutions every 100 000 generations increases the number of filled cells by 20% and the average quality of the solutions by 50% in some experimental setups [37].\nIn other studies, Pugh et al. [16], [17] analyzed the impact of the alignment between the solution descriptor and the quality score on both Novelty-based approaches (including NSLC) and MAP-Elites. For example, if the descriptor space represents the location of the robot in a maze, and the quality score represents the distance between this position and the exit, then the descriptor space and the quality score are strongly aligned because the score can be computed according to the descriptor. The experimental results show that in the case of such alignments with the quality score, then novelty-based approaches are more effective than MAP-Elites, and vice-versa.\nAnother study also reveals that the choice of the encoding (the mapping between the genotype and the phenotype) critically impacts the quality of the produced collections [39]. The experimental results link these differences to the locality of the encoding (i.e., the propensity of the encoding to produce similar behaviors after a single mutation). In other words, the behavioral diversity provided by indirect encoding, which is known to empower traditional evolutionary algorithms [40], appears to be counterproductive with MAP-Elites, while the locality of direct encodings allows MAP-Elites to consistently fill the collection of behaviors.\nThese different works illustrate the interest of the community in QD-algorithms and that our understanding of the underlying dynamics is only in its early stages. However, very few works\n5 compare MAP-Elites and NSLC on the same applications (the few exceptions being [16], [17], [31], [36]), or investigate alternative approaches to produce collections of solutions. One of the goals of this paper is to introduce a new and common framework for these algorithms to exploit their synergies and to encourage comparisons and the creation of new algorithms. The next section introduces this framework."

      "heading" : "III. A UNITED AND MODULAR FRAMEWORK FOR QD-OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS",
      "text" : "As presented in the previous section, most works using or comparing QD-algorithms consider either MAP-Elites or NSLC-based algorithms, or direct comparisons of these two algorithms. These comparisons are relevant because of the distinct origins of these two algorithms. However, they only provide high-level knowledge and do not provide much insight of properties or particularities which make one algorithm better than the other.\nIn this section, we introduce a new and common framework for QD-algorithms, which can be instantiated with different operators, such as different selection or aggregation operators, similarly to most evolutionary algorithms. This framework demonstrates that MAP-Elites and NSLC can be formulated as the same algorithm using a different combination of operators. Indeed, specific configurations of this framework are equivalent to MAP-Elites or NSLC. However, this framework opens new perspectives as some other configurations lead to algorithms that share the advantages of both MAP-Elites and NSLC. For example, it can be used to design an algorithm that is as simple as MAP-Elites but working on an unstructured archive (rather than a grid), or to investigate different selection pressures like NSLC. Moreover, this decomposition of the algorithms allows us to draw conclusions on the key elements that make an algorithm better than the others (e.g., the selective pressure or the way to form the collection).\nThis new formulation is composed of two main operators: 1) a container, which gathers and orders the solutions into a collection, and 2) the selection operator, which selects the solutions that will be altered (via mutations and crossover) during the next batch (or generation). The selection operator is similar to the selection operators used in traditional evolutionary algorithms, except that it considers not only the current population, but all the solutions contained in the container as well. Other operators can be considered with this new formulation, like the traditional mutation or cross-over operators. However, in this paper we only consider the operators described above that are specific to QD-algorithms.\nAfter a random initialization, the execution of a QDalgorithm based on this framework follows four steps that are repeated:\n• The selection operator produces a new set of individuals (bparents) that will be altered in order to form the new batch of evaluations (boffspring). • The individuals of boffspring are evaluated and their performance and descriptor are recorded. • Each of these individuals is then potentially added to the container, according to the solutions already in the collection.\n• Finally, several scores, like the novelty, the local competition, or the curiosity (defined in section III-B3) score, are updated.\nThese four steps repeat until a stopping criterion is reached (typically, a maximum number of iterations) and the algorithm outputs the collection stored in the container. More details can be found in the pseudo-code of the algorithm, defined in Algorithm 1. In the following subsections, we will detail different variants of the container, as well as the selection operators."

      "heading" : "A. Containers",
      "text" : "The main purpose of a container is to gather all the solutions found so far into an ordered collection, in which only the best and most diverse solutions are kept. One of the main differences between MAP-Elites and NSLC is the way the collection of solutions is formed. While MAP-Elites relies on an N-dimensional grid, NSLC uses an unstructured archive based on the Euclidean distance between solution descriptors. These two different approaches constitute two different container types. In the following, we will detail their implementation and particularities.\n1) The Grid: MAP-Elites employs an N-dimensional grid to form the collection of solutions [15], [4]. The descriptor space is discretized and the different dimensions of the grid correspond to the dimensions of the solution descriptor. With this discretization, each cell of the grid represents one solution type. In the initial works introducing MAP-Elites, only one solution can be contained in each cell. However, one can imagine having more individuals per cell (like in [17] in which two individuals are kept). Similarly, in the case of multi-objective optimization, each cell can represent the Pareto front for each solution type. Nevertheless, these considerations are outside the scope of this paper. a) Procedure to add solutions into the container: The procedure to add an individual to the collection is relatively straight forward. If the cell corresponding to the descriptor of the individual is empty, then the individual is added to the grid. Otherwise, if the cell is already occupied, only the individual with the highest performance is kept in the grid. b) Computing the novelty/diversity of a solution: The inherent structure of the grid provides an efficient way to compute the novelty of each solution. Instead of considering the average distance of the k-nearest neighbors as a novelty score, like suggested in [18], here we can consider the number of filled cells around the considered individual. The density of filled cells of the sub-grid defined around the individual is a good indicator of the novelty of the solution. Similarly to the “k” parameter used in the k-nearest neighbors, the sub-grid is defined according to a parameter that governs its size, which is defined as ±k cells around the individual (in each direction). In this case, the score needs to be minimized.\n2) The Archive: The novelty archive introduced in the Novelty Search algorithm consists of an unstructured collection of solutions that are only organized according to their descriptor and their Euclidean distance. As introduced in the BR-Evolution algorithm [13], the novelty archive can be used to form the\n6 Algorithm 1 QD-Optimization algorithm ( I iterations) (A ← ∅) .

In contrast with the grid container presented previously, the descriptor space here is not discretized and the structure of the collection autonomously emerges from the encountered solutions.\na) Procedure to add solutions into the container: The management of the solutions is crucial with this container because it affects both the quality, and the final coverage of the collection. A first attempt was proposed in the BR-Evolution algorithm [13] by extending the archive management of the Novelty Search [18]: an individual is added to the archive if its novelty score exceeds a predefined threshold (which can be adjusted over time), or if it outperforms its nearest neighbor in the archive. In the second case, the nearest neighbor is removed from the archive and only the best of the two individuals is kept.\nWhile this archive management is relatively simple, further experiments reveal underlying limitations [29]. First, an individual with the same (or very close) descriptor as another individual can be added to the archive. Indeed, the novelty score, which is based on the average distance of the k-nearest neighbors, can still be relatively high even when two individuals are close if the rest of the collection is further. One of the consequences of using the novelty score as a criterion to add the solution in the container is that the collection is likely to show an uneven density of solutions [13], [29]. For example, experiments in these works show collections that contain a high density of solutions in certain regions (the inter-individuals distance being notably lower than the Novelty Score threshold used to add individual into the collection). While this property can be interesting for some applications, it mainly originates from a side effect. Second, the same experiments reveal that the replacement of individuals by better ones can erode the border of the collection, as discussed in the previous section. Indeed, in some cases, the individuals in the center of the collection show better performance than the ones in its border (because of the intrinsic structure of the performance function or because the center has been more intensively explored). This can lead to the replacement of individuals that are on the border of the collection by individuals that are closer to the center. This is an important limitation as it reduces the\nQuality\nNovelty\nI1\nI2\nZone dominating I1\nQ1\nN1\n\uD835\uDF00xQ1\n\uD835\uDF00xN1\nA\nB\nC l\nFig. 2: Management of collections of solutions based on an unstructured archive. A) A solution is directly added to the collection if its nearest neighbor from the collection is further than l. B) Conversely, if the distance is smaller than l (i.e., if the circles overlap), the new solution is not automatically added to the collection, but competes against its nearest neighbor. If the new solution dominates the one already in the collection, then the new solution replaces the previous one. C) In the strict -domination, a solution dominates another one if the progress in one objective is larger than the decrease in the other objective (up to a predefined value ).\ncoverage of the collection, as shown in [29]. In order to mitigate these limitations, we propose the following new way to manage solutions in the archive. A solution is added to the archive if the distance to its nearest neighbor exceeds a predefined threshold l (see Fig. 2.A). This parameter defines the maximal density of the collection. The threshold is similar to the novelty score threshold used in the original Novelty Search algorithm, except that in this case we only consider the distance of the nearest neighbor, and not the average distance of the k-nearest ones.\nIf the distance between the new individual and its nearest neighbor is lower than l, then this new individual can potentially replace its nearest neighbor in the collection. This is only the case if its distance from its second nearest neighbor exceeds the l parameter, such that the distance among the solutions is preserved (see Fig. 2.B) and if it improves the overall quality of the collection. A new individual can improve the overall collection in two ways: 1) if it has a better quality, which increases the total quality of the collection or 2) if it has a better novelty score, which means that it extends the coverage\n7 of the collection. This can be seen as two objectives that need to be maximized. From this perspective, we can use the definition of Pareto dominance to decide if an individual should replace another one already in the collection. Therefore, a simple criterion could be to replace an existing individual, only if it is dominated by the new one. However, this criterion is very difficult to reach, as the new individual should be both better and more diverse than the previous one. This prevents most new individuals from being added to the collection, which limits the quality of the produced collections.\nIn order to soften this criterion, we introduce a variant of the -dominance [41], that we name the exclusive -dominance. In this variant, we tolerate the dominating individual being worse than the other individual according to one of the objectives (up to a predefined percentage governed by ), only if it is better on the other objective by at least the same amount (see Fig. 2.C). This criterion is more strict than the original -dominance, which allows an individual to be dominated by another one that is worse on both objectives. From a mathematical point of view, an individual x1 dominates x2 if these three points are verified:\n1) N(x1) >= (1− ) ∗N(x2) 2) Q(x1) >= (1− ) ∗Q(x2) 3) (N(x1)−N(x2))∗Q(x2) > −(Q(x1)−Q(x2))∗N(x2)\nwith N corresponding to the Novelty Score and Q to the Quality (or performance) of an individual, which both need to be maximized1. This set of conditions makes the addition of new individuals in the container more flexible, but rejects individuals that do not improve the collection.\nThe experimental results presented in section IV demonstrate that this new archive management overcomes the limitation of the previous approaches by producing collections with similar coverage and quality compared with the grid-based container.\nb) Computing the novelty of a solution: With the archivebased container, the computation of the novelty score can be done with the traditional approach proposed by Lehman and Stanley [18], which consists of the average distance of the k-nearest neighbors.\n3) Partial Conclusion: These two different types of containers both present advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, the grid-based container provides a simple and effective way to manage the collection. However, it requires discretizing the descriptor space beforehand, which can be problematic for example if the discretization is not adequate, or needs to be changed over time. On the other hand, the archive-based container offers more flexibility, as it only requires the definition of a distance in the descriptor space. For example, specific distances can be used to compare complex descriptors, like images, without a strong knowledge of the structure of the descriptor space (e.g., number of dimensions or limits) [27]. However, this advantage is a disadvantage as well, because it implies that the algorithm needs to find the appropriate structure of the collection on its own, which represents an additional challenge compared to the grid-based container.\n1This definition could very likely be generalized to more than two objectives, but this question is beyond the scope of this paper.\nFor these reasons, the choice of the most suitable container depends more on the considered applications, rather than on their performance. Therefore, while we will consider both of the containers in the experimental section of this paper, we will not directly compare their results, as the comparison may not be fair and may be irrelevant with respect to the considered applications.\nThese two containers have been designed to provide uniform coverage of the descriptor space. However, experiments reveal that the accumulation of density on specific regions of the descriptor space is a key factor for the Novelty Search algorithm, as it allows the novelty score to constantly change over time. To avoid this issue, one can use an additional container in which the density accumulates and that drives the exploration, while the other container gathers the collection that will be return to the user. In this paper, we will only focus on variants using only one container, however we will consider extending the framework presented in this paper to multiple containers in future works."

      "text" : "The second main difference between MAP-Elites and NSLC is the way the next batch, or population2, of solutions is selected before being evaluated. On the one hand, MAP-Elites forms the next batch by randomly selecting solutions that are already in the collection. On the other hand, NSLC relies on the current population of solutions and selects the individuals that are both novel and locally high-performing (according to a Pareto front). This difference is of significant importance as MAP-Elites uses the entire collection of solutions, while NSLC only considers a smaller set of solutions.\nSimilarly to the concept of containers, different approaches for selecting the individuals of the next batch can be considered. In the following subsections, we will present several selection methods that can be employed with both container types.\n1) No Selection: A naive way to generate the next batch of evaluation is to generate random solutions. However, this approach is likely ineffective because it makes the QDalgorithm equivalent to a random sampling of the search space. In general, this approach provides an intuition about the difficulty of the task and can be used as a base-line when comparing alternative approaches.\n2) Uniform Random Selection: A second way to select solutions that will be used in the next batch is to select solutions with a uniform probability from those that are already in the collection. This approach is the one used in MAP-Elites and follows the idea that promising solutions are close to each other. In addition to being relatively simple, this approach has the advantage of being computationally effective. However, one of its main drawbacks is that the selection pressure decreases as the number of solutions in the collection increases (the chance for a solution to be selected being inversely proportional to\n2We use the word batch instead of generation because most of the approaches presented in this paper can be used in a “steady state”, selecting and evaluating only one individual at each iteration. However, considering the selection and evaluation in batches allows the algorithm to execute the evaluation in parallel, which increases the computational efficiency of the algorithm.\n8 the number of solutions in the collection), which is likely to be ineffective with large collections.\n3) Score Proportionate Selection: An intuitive way to mitigate the loss of selection pressure from the random selection is to bias the selection according to a particular score. Similarly to traditional evolutionary algorithms, the selection among the solutions of the collection can be biased according to their quality (fitness), following the roulette wheel or the tournamentbased selection principles [42].\nOther scores can also be considered to bias the selection. For example, the novelty score of each solution can substitute for the quality score for fostering the algorithm to focus on solutions that are different from the others.\nIn addition to these two scores, in this paper we introduce a new score, named the Curiosity Score, that can be used to bias the selection and which is defined as follows:\nDefinition III.1: Curiosity Score\nThe curiosity score represents the propensity of an individual to generate offspring that are added to the collection.\nA practical implementation (see Algorithm 1) consists of increasing the curiosity score of an individual (initially set to zero) each time one of its offspring is added to the collection. Conversely, when an offspring fails to be added to the archive (because it is not novel or high-performing enough), the Curiosity Score is decreased. In this paper, we use respectively 1 and −0.5 for the reward and the penalty values. With this implementation, individuals may gain momentum, but this means that such individual will be selected more often, making their score more likely to rapidly decrease.\nWe named this score “Curiosity” because it encourages the algorithm to focus on individuals that produce interesting solutions, until nothing new is produced. In other words, the algorithm focuses on regions of the search space as long as they produce interesting results, then, when the algorithm gets “bored”, it focuses its attention on different regions. This behavior is similar to the one of the “Intelligent Adaptive Curiosity” [43], while the implementation and the inspiration are strictly different.\nA similar approach has recently been introduced to bias the selection by using the same kind of successful offspring counter [44]. The difference is that, in this paper, the counter is initialized to a fixed value (i.e., 10 in [44]) instead of starting at 0 like with the curiosity score, and that when an offspring is added to the collection, the counter is not incremented (like with the curiosity score), but rather reset to its maximal value. This difference make the selection process more forgivable, as only one successful offspring is enough to make its parent very likely to be selected again. While it would be interesting to compare the effect of these two different, but related, methods, this comparison is out of the scope of this paper.\nAlthough there is no overall agreement on the definition of evolvability [45], we can note that our definition of the curiosity score shares similarities with some of the first definitions of evolvability, like the one given by Lee Altenberg who defines the evolvability as the ability of a population to produce variants\nfitter than any yet existing [46]. One important aspect shared by these two definitions is that the score or the evolvability may dynamically change over time according to the state of the population or the collection, which is rarely considered in evolvability’s definitions. For instance, the definition often used in Evolutionary Computation [38], [45], [30], which considers that the evolvability captures the propensity of random variations to generate phenotypic diversity, depends on the genome of the individual but not on the state of the population.\n4) Population-based Selection: All selection approaches described so far select the individuals from the solutions contained in the collection. This represents one of the main differences introduced by MAP-Elites compared to NSLC and traditional evolutionary algorithms, as the collection becomes the “population” of the algorithm and this population progressively grows during the evolutionary process. However, to handle the selection, we can consider employing populations in parallel to the collection. This is in line with the Novelty Search algorithm which computes the novelty score based on the Collection (the Novelty archive), but instead uses a traditional population to handle the selection.\nThis approach can be included in the framework proposed in this paper by initializing the population with the first batch and then, after each batch evaluation, a new population can be generated based on the individuals of the current population (boffspring) and their parents (bparents). Classic selection approaches, like tournament or score proportionate, can be employed to select the individuals that will be part of the next population. Like in the collection-based selection, the selection can be biased according to either the quality, novelty or curiosity scores.\n5) Pareto-based Selection: The population-based selection approach can be extended to multi-objective selection, via the Pareto ranking, by taking inspiration from the NSGA-II algorithm [26]. In this paper, we will particularly consider a Pareto-based selection operator that takes both the novelty score and the local quality score (number of neighbors that outperform the solution) of the individuals into account. This selection operator is similar to the selection procedure of NSLC.\n6) Partial Conclusion: These different selection operators can all be equally used with both of the containers presented in the previous section. While the choice of the container influences the type of the produced results (e.g., unstructured or discretized descriptor space, see section III-A3), the selection operators will only influence the quality of the results. Therefore, it is of importance to know which operators provide the best collection of solutions. In the following section, we provide a first answer to this question by comparing the collections produced by the different selection operators and by investigating their behaviors."

Like in [16], all individuals of the population are potentially added to a grid container (the same as the one used with the others variants) after each generation. We then used the produced grid container to compare NSLC with the other variants. For this experiment, we used the implementation of NSLC provided by the Sferesv2 framework [47].\nIn the experiments presented in this paper, we only consider direct encodings with genomes that are small and fixed in size. It would be interesting to see how the conclusion drawn from these experiments hold with large genomes, genomes of increasing complexity over generations, or indirect encodings. For instance, [39] highlights that indirect encodings may have a negative impact on QD-algorithms. However, these further considerations are out of the scope of this paper and will be considered in future works."

      "heading" : "A. Quality Metrics",
      "text" : "In order to compare the quality of the collections generated by each variant, we define four quality metrics that characterize both the coverage and the performance of the solutions:\n1) Collection Size: indicates the number of solutions contained in the collection and thus refers to the proportion of the descriptor space that is covered by the collection.\n2) Maximal Quality: corresponds to the quality of the best solution contained in the collection and indicates if the global extremum of the performance function has been found (if it is known).\n3) Total Quality: is the sum of the qualities over all the solutions contained in the collection. This metric provides information on the global quality of the collection as it can\nbe improved either by finding additional individuals or by improving those already in the collection. It corresponds to the metric named “Quality Diversity” used in [16].\n4) Total Novelty: This metric is similar to the previous one, except that the sum considers the novelty score and not the quality value. This metric indicates if the collection is well distributed over the description space or rather if the solutions are highly concentrated. This metric will not be considered for collections produced with the grid-based container because the distribution of the solutions is forced by the grid.\nOther metrics: In [15], [39], the authors presented other metrics to compare collections produced by MAP-Elites. However, the main idea of these metrics is to normalize the quality of each solution by the maximal quality that can be achieved by each type of solution (i.e., by each grid cell). To infer the highest possible quality for each cell, the authors selected the best solution found by all the algorithms over all the replicates. However, this approach is only feasible with the grid-based container because the continuous descriptor space used in the archive-based container makes it challenging to associate and compare each “solution type”. For this reason, in this paper we decided to only consider the four metrics presented previously."

      "text" : "1) Experimental Setup: In this first experimental comparison, we consider a redundant and planar robotic arm with 8 degrees of freedom that needs to discover how to reach every point in its vicinity. The quality function captures the idea that all joints of the arm should contribute equally to the movement, which allows quick transitions from one configuration to the next one. This constraint is defined by the variance of the angular position of the joints when the robot reaches its final configuration, and needs to be minimized by the algorithm. This experimental setup illustrates the need of quality-diversity algorithms because it needs to simultaneously find a solution for all the reachable positions and to optimize the quality function for each of them.\n10\nTo simulate the robotic arm, we consider its kinematic structure, which provides the location of its gripper according to the angular position of all joints. The solutions that are optimized by the algorithms consist of a set of angular positions that govern the final configuration of the different joints of the robot. Neither the trajectory of the robot between its initial and final positions, nor internal collisions are simulated in this experiment.\nThe solution descriptor is defined as the final position of the gripper, which is then normalized according to a square bounding box to have values between 0 and 1. The size of the bounding box is 2 ∗ 1.1 ∗ L, where L is the total length of the robot when totally deployed (the factor 1.1 is used to leave some room between the border of the descriptor space and the robot). The center of the box corresponds to the location of the robot’s base.\nAn extensive set of configurations from the QD-algorithm framework (see algorithm 1) has been tested on this experimental setup (see Table I), and the execution of each of those variants has been replicated 20 times. The parameter values used for this experiment can be found in Table II.\n2) Results: A typical collection of solutions produced by each of the tested variants is pictured in Figure 3. The collections using the archive-based container appear very similar to those using the other container type. This similarity, which holds in the other experiments as well, demonstrates that the archive management introduced in this paper successfully address the erosion issues described previously. Theoretically, the ideal result homogeneously covers a quasi-circular region and the performance (i.e., the color) should be arranged in concentric shapes resembling cardioids (inverted, heart-shaped curves)3. This type of collection is found using the random, the fitness or the curiosity-based selection operators (over the collection) regardless of the container type used, as well as with the NSLC algorithm. The novelty based selection with the archive-based container also produces such a collection, while this is not the case with the grid-based container. It is interesting to note that the no-selection approach, which can be considered as a motor babbling or random search, is unable to produce the desired result. While the coverage is decent, the quality of the gathered solutions is not satisfactory.\nNone of the population-based variants managed to produce a collection that both covers all the reachable space and contains high-performing solutions. This result could be explained by a convergence of the population toward specific regions of the collection. Typically, the population considering the fitness is likely to converge toward regions with high quality, whereas the population considering the novelty score converges to the\n3We can demonstrate that the points with the highest performance are located on a curve resembling a cardioid by computing the position of the end-effector for which all angular positions of the joints are set to the same angle (from −π/2 to +π/2).\n11\n0 1 2 3 4 5 0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\n6000\n× 104 4.9 5\n5300\n5310\n5320\n5330\n5340\n5350\n× 104 0 1 2 3 4 5\n-0.45 -0.4\n-0.35 -0.3\n-0.25 -0.2\n-0.15 -0.1\n-0.05 0\n× 104 4.9 5\n-0.018 -0.016 -0.014 -0.012\n-0.01 -0.008 -0.006 -0.004 -0.002\n0\n× 104 0 1 2 3 4 5\n0 500\n1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 4500\n× 104 4.9 5\n4300\n4310\n4320\n4330\n4340\n4350\n× 104 0 1 2 3 4 5\n20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\n100\n× 104 4.9 5\n91.7\n91.8\n91.9\n92\n92.1\n92.2\n92.3\n× 104\n× 104 0 1 2 3 4 5\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\n6000\n7000\n4.9 5 6120 6140 6160 6180 6200 6220 6240 6260 6280\n× 104\n-0.35\n-0.25\n-0.15\n-0.05\n× 104 0 1 2 3 4 5\n-0.4\n-0.3\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0\n4.9 5 -10\n-8\n-6\n-4\n-2\n0\n2\n× 104\n× 10-3\n× 104 0 1 2 3 4 5\n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\n6000\n4.9 5 4980\n5000\n5020\n5040\n5060\n5080\n5100\n5120\n× 104\nG ri\nd Collection size Total Quality Total Novelty\nNumber of Iterations\nno_selection random\npareto fitness novelty curiosity pop_fitness pop_novelty pop_curiosity\nNSLC Number of Iterations Number of Iterations\nNumber of Iterations\nMaximal Quality A rc h iv e\nFig. 4: Progression of the quality metrics in the redundant arm experiment. The first row depicts the results from variants using the archive-based container, while the second row considers variants with the grid-based container. Because of the difficulty to distinguish the different variants, a zoom on the best variants during the last 1000 batches is pictured on the right of each plot. The middle lines represent the median performance over the 20 replications, while the shaded areas extend to the first and third quartiles. In this experiment, the quality score is negative, thus in order to get a monotonic progression in the “Total Quality” metric, +1 is added to the Quality to have a positive score.\nborder of the collection. The results of the variant using a population with the curiosity score could be explained by the difficulty to keep track of all individuals with a relatively small population (200 individuals in the population compared to about 6.000 in the entire collection). The curiosity score is dynamic, and changes during the evolutionary process (an individual can have a high curiosity score at one moment, for example if it reaches a new region of the descriptor space, and can have a very low curiosity score later during the process, for instance when the region becomes filled with good solutions). Therefore, it is likely that the individuals with the highest curiosity score are not contained in the population.\nMoreover, we can observe different results between the gridbased and the archive-based container variants considering the novelty score. This difference is likely to originate from the fact that the novelty score is computed differently in these two container types. Indeed, while in the archivebased container the novelty score follows the formulation introduced by Lehman and Stanley [18], in the grid-based container, the novelty score is computed based on the number of individuals in the neighboring cells (see section III-A1b). Both of these expressions capture the density of solutions around the considered individuals. However, in the grid based container, the novelty score is discretized (because it is related to the number of neighboring solutions). This discretization is likely to have a strong impact on score-based selection variants using the novelty score because all individuals in the center of the collection will have the same and lowest novelty score (because of all neighboring cells being filled). In the score-based selection, individuals with the lowest score have nearly no chance of being selected, which makes the selection focus on the border of the collection. This behavior is not observed with the archive-based container because the novelty\nscore is continuous and the distribution of the solutions in the collection adds some variability in the novelty score, which makes it impossible to have several individuals with the lowest novelty score.\nWhile the Pareto-based selection is designed to be similar to the NSLC algorithm, by keeping in the population individuals that both have a high novelty and local-competition scores, we can see that the collection produced by NSLC is significantly better than the Pareto-based selection approach. We can explain this poor performance by the presence of a Pareto-optimal solution in this scenario. Indeed, the solution in which the robot has all his joint positions set to zero has the best fitness and is located on the border of the collection, which provides a high novelty score. It is worth noting that we can mitigate this issue by implementing a toroidal distance or container (like in [17]), when such a representation is compatible with the descriptor space. This is not the case in our experiments. A behavior that reaches one end of the reachable space of the robot is not meant to be considered similar to individuals that reach the opposite end of the reachable space. For these reasons, the population is then very likely to converge to this Pareto-optimal solution and thus, to neglect certain regions of the collection. The size of the population is probably a limiting factor as well. A large number of equivalent solutions in terms of Pareto-dominance exist (all those in the center of the collection with the highest fitness), which makes it difficult for the population to cover the entire descriptor space.\nNSLC is not impacted in the same way because the original archive management allows the density to constantly accumulate around over-explored regions (for instance by varying the novelty threshold, as described in [14]). Thanks to this feature, the novelty score constantly changes over time and makes pareto optimal solutions disappear quickly. Indeed,\n12\nthe regions that contain pareto optimal solutions will rapidly see their density increased making the novelty score of the corresponding individuals less competitive compared with the rest of the population.\nIt is important to note that the NSLC variant uses two containers and one population during the evolutionary process. The population and one of the containers (the novelty archive) are used to drive the exploration process, while the second container (a grid-based container) gathers the collection that will be delivered to the user.\nThe variations of the quality metrics (see Fig. 4) demonstrate that among all tested variants, the best collections are provided by variants which perform the selection based on the entire collection.\nThe coverage, maximal quality, total quality, and total novelty of the collections produced with selection operators considering the entire collections is higher than those using populationbased selection (all p-values < 7e− 8 from the Wilcoxon rank sum tests4, except for the “(grid/arch) pop fitness” approaches which are not significantly different in terms of maximal quality and for “grid novelty” which performs significantly worse than the other collection-based approaches). The only exception is the novelty-based selection with the grid-based container, which is unable to correctly fill the center of the collection, as it focuses on its borders.\nWe can note that the variant using the Pareto-based selection with the archive-based container produces collections that are better than those from variants using population-based selection, but worse than those produced by variants that consider the entire collection for the selection. However, the Pareto-based selection shows the best results according to the maximal quality metrics.\nWhile the difference among variants using the entire collection in the selection with the grid-based container is negligible, the curiosity-based selection appears to be significantly better (even if the difference is small) than the other selection approaches on all the metrics with the archive-based container (all p-values< 2e − 4 for all the metrics except for the total novelty in which p-values< 0.01). This observation demonstrates that relying on individuals with a high-propensity to generate individuals that are added to the collection is a promising selection heuristic.\nWe can observe that the NSLC variant performs significantly better than the pareto-based approach and that its performance is close to, but lower than, those of the variants that use selection operators considering the entire collections."

      "heading" : "C. The Robot Walking in Every Direction",
      "text" : "1) The Experimental Setup: In this second experimental setup, we consider a six-legged robot in a physical simulator. The objective of the QD-algorithms is to produce a collection of behaviors that allows the robot to walk in every direction and at different speeds.\n4The reported p-values should be compared to a threshold α (usually set to0.05) which is corrected to deal with the “Multiple Comparisons problem”. In this paper, all our conclusions about the significance of a difference is given by correcting α according to the Holm-Bonferroni method [48].\nThis experimental setup has first been introduced in [13]. Each potential solution consists of a set of 36 parameters (6 per leg) that define the way each of the robot’s joint is moving (the controller is the same as the one used in [4]). During the evaluation of a solution, the robot executes the behavior defined by the parameters for three seconds, and its final position and orientation are recorded. The descriptor space is defined by the final position of the robot (X and Y coordinates), while the quality of the solution corresponds to the orientation error with respect to a desired orientation, which encourages the robot to follow circular trajectories. These kinds of trajectories are interesting for planning purposes as any arbitrary trajectory can be decomposed as a succession of circular arcs. In order to be able to chain circular trajectories, the robot needs to be aligned with the tangent of these circles at the beginning and the end of each movement. We can note that only one circular trajectory goes through both the initial and final positions of the robot with its tangent aligned with the initial orientation of the robot. The difference between the final orientation of the robot and the direction of the tangent of this unique circular trajectory defines the orientation error, which is minimized by the QD algorithms (more details can be found in [13]).\nThe usage of the physical simulator makes the experiments significantly longer (between 4 and 5 hours are required to perform 10,000 batches with one variant). For this reason, the number of generations has been decreased to 10,000 and only 10 variants (those in bold in Table I) are considered for this experiment. This sub-set of variants includes variants that are related to MAP-Elites, NSLC, Motor Babbling, traditional population-based EA and the variant considering the curiosity score over the entire collection. The execution of each of those variants has been replicated 10 times. The value of the parameters used for this experiment can be found in Table II.\n2) Results: From a high-level point of view, the same conclusion as previously can be drawn based on the resulting collections (see Fig. 5): The variants “no selection” and “pop fitness” produce worse collections than the other variants, while the variants “random”, “curiosity” and NSLC generate the best collections. In this experiment, the “Pareto” variant performs better than in the previous one. This result can be explained by the absence of a unique Pareto-optimal solution.\nThe quality metrics indicate that the “curiosity” variants, on both the grid and the archive containers, significantly outperform the other algorithms (see Fig. 6, all p-values < 0.01, except when compared to arch random in terms of total novelty in which p-value = 0.05). These results also demonstrate that this second experimental scenario is more challenging for the algorithms, as the difference in the metrics is clear and the performance of the naive “no selection” is very low.\nIn this experiment, the NSLC variant shows similar results to the “random” variant (which corresponds to the MAP-Elites algorithm). In particular, the final size of the collection and the final total quality are not significantly different (p-values< 0.61). However, the performance of the “curiosity” approach remains significantly better on both aspects (p-values< 0.0047) compared to NSLC.\n13"

However, in this case the robot has to learn a large collection of gaits to walk in a straight line as fast as possible. This scenario is inspired by [4].\nIn this experiment, the quality score is the traveled distance after walking for 3 seconds, and the solution descriptor is the proportion of time that each leg is in contact with the ground. The descriptor space has thus 6 dimensions in this experiment.\nThe experiment has been replicated 10 times and the other parameters of the algorithm can be found in Table II.\n2) Results: From a general point of view, the same conclusion as in the previous experiments can be drawn from the progression of quality metrics (see Fig.7)5. Variants selecting individuals from the whole collection significantly outperform, in terms of coverage, total quality and diversity, those that consider populations (all the p-values< 2e− 4). In particular, the curiosity-based selection operator shows the best results both with the grid-based and the archive-based containers. For instance, one can note that the total quality achieved by the\n5Visualizations of the collections are not provided in this experiment because of the high-dimensionality of the descriptor-space. While the grid-based collections could have been depicted with the same approach as in [4], this approach cannot be applied with the archive-based container.\n14\nrandom selection (second best approach) after 20,000 batches, is achieved by the curiosity-based selection after only 11,000 batches with the archive-based container and 13,500 batches with the grid-based container.\nIn contrast with the previous experiment, the “no selection” variants manage to achieve good coverage (about half of the coverage produced by the variants using the collection-wise selection). However, they show the worst results according to the total quality and the maximal quality metrics.\nThe variants using the population-based selection with respect to the performance show the opposite results. While the coverage of this variant is the worst among all the evaluated variants with both of the container types, this selection approach, which is similar to a traditional EA, found the solutions with the best quality (the fastest way to walk). In particular, the performance achieved with this variant significantly outperforms the best solutions compared to every other variant, even those using the collection-wise selection (pvalues< 0.0017). This observation shows that the best variants tested so far are not always able to find the global extremum of the quality. The quality difference between the “pop fitness” variants and the others is smaller with the grid-based container than with the archive-based. This quality difference could be explained by the difference in the collection sizes, or the additional difficulty of finding the inherent structure of the collection for the archive-based container.\nThe Pareto-based variants are low-performing in this experiment. They show neither a good coverage (similar to the “no selection” or the “pop fitness” variants) nor a good maximal quality (lower than the variants with a collection-wise selection). It is difficult to understand the reasons for such a low performance in this experiment, as the behavioral space is 6 dimensional, making it hard to visualize. However, it is likely that it happens for the same reasons as in the previous experiments, like a premature convergence to the border of the collection (which show relatively bad performance), or the existence of a Pareto-optimal solution. In contrast with the Pareto-based variants, NSLC achieves good coverage of the behavioral space in this experiment, while smaller than the “random” and “curiosity” ones. However, the maximal quality found on the produced collection is lower than most of the considered variants (p-values< 0.03746 except with the “no selection” variant, p-value= 0.9696), and the global quality of the collections is equivalent to those of the Pareto-based variant."

First, we introduced a new framework that unifies QD-algorithms, showing for example that MAP-Elites and the Novelty Search with Local Competition are two different configurations of the same algorithm. Second, we suggested a new archive management procedure that copes with the erosion issues observed with the previous approaches using unstructured archives (like BR-evolution). This new procedure demonstrates good results\n6These p-values do not reject the null-hypothesis based on the HolmBonferroni method with a α = 0.05, but reject it with α = 0.1.\nas it allows the algorithms to produce unstructured collections with the same coverage as those with grid containers, which was not the case with the previous management procedure [31]. Finally, we proposed a new selective pressure specific for QDalgorithms, named “curiosity score” that shows very promising results by outperforming all the existing QD-algorithms on all the experiments presented in this paper.\nIn addition to these three contributions, we presented the results of an experimental comparison between a large number of QD-algorithms, including MAP-Elites and NSLC. One of the main results that can be outlined from these experiments is that selection operators considering the collection instead of a population showed better performance on all scenarios. We can hypothesize that this results from the inherent diversity of solutions contained in the collection. Indeed, several works suggest that maintaining the behavioral diversity in populations of evolutionary algorithms (via additional objective for example) is a key factor to avoid local extremum and to find promising stepping stones [40], [18].\nAnother fundamental lesson learned from the experiments presented in this paper is about the importance of allowing the density of solutions to increase in diverse regions of the archive to obtain the full effectiveness the NSLC. This can be achieved by varying the novelty-score threshold or via probabilistic addition to the archive[37]. While such mechanisms are often used in the literature, their importance is rarely highlighted by experimental comparisons like in this paper. In particular, we demonstrated that algorithms using the novelty score, but with archives in which the density does not increase, are unable to show similar results to NSLC, because they are severely impacted by certain aspects of the fitness landscape (e.g., presence of Pareto-optimal solutions).\nThis unified and modular framework for QD-algorithms is intended to encourage new research directions via novel container types, selection operators, or selective pressures that are specific to this domain. We expect that the emergence of new QD-algorithms will provide insights about the key factors for producing the best collection of solutions."

      "text" : "The source code of the QD-algorithm framework is available at https://github.com/sferes2/modular QD. It is based on the Sferesv2 framework [47] and implements both the grid-based and archive-based containers and several selection operators, including all those that have been evaluated in this paper. The source code of the experimental setups is available at the same location and can be used by interested readers to investigate and evaluate new QD-algorithms.\nThe implementation allows researchers to easily implement and evaluate new combinations of operators, while maintaining high execution speed. For this reason, we followed the policybased design in C++ [49], which allows developers to replace the behavior of the program simply by changing the template declarations of the algorithm. For example, changing from the grid-based container to the archive-based one only requires changing “container::Grid” to “container::Archive” in the template definition of the QD-algorithm object. Moreover, the\n15\nmodularity provided by this design pattern does not add any overhead, contrary to classic Object-Oriented Programming design. Interested readers are welcome to use and to contribute to the source code."

Recently, a new family of optimization algorithms, named Quality-Diversity optimization, has been introduced, and contrasts with classic algorithms. Instead of searching for a single solution, Quality-Diversity algorithms are searching for a large collection of both diverse and high-performing solutions. The role of this collection is to cover the range of possible solution types as much as possible, and to contain the best solution for each type. The contribution of this paper is threefold. Firstly, we present a unifying framework of Quality-Diversity optimization algorithms that covers the two main algorithms of this family (Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites and the Novelty Search with Local Competition), and that highlights the large variety of variants that can be investigated within this family. Secondly, we propose algorithms with a new selection mechanism for Quality-Diversity algorithms that outperforms all the algorithms tested in this paper. Lastly, we present a new collection management that overcomes the erosion issues observed when using unstructured collections. These three contributions are supported by extensive experimental comparisons of Quality-Diversity algorithms on three different experimental scenarios.",
