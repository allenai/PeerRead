A solution is not to satisfy any of them, rather, set criteria that the intuitions themselves approach, as by the definition of the criteria each follows from it instead of the reverse [2].\nIt can be argued that everything that has been thus far theorized as a means to a solution to the “problem of artificial intelligence” is derived from a priori knowledge whose theorems are posited by synthetical judgments. Why this is true can be stated simply: We, as humans, have never experienced nor have been provided judgments of artificial beings save by the process of having developed them, therefore it is impossible to describe them cogently without the specter of fallacious judgments we would never be aware of except for the passage of time. It is, then, for this reason that a new imperative needs to be discovered with which to guide our reason and logic.\nI propose the conundrum facing artificial intelligence researchers can be assayed using transcendental logic. In order to clarify the current state of the vexation why a logical imperative cannot be assigned universally because we, as humans, have no experience of how this concept is rooted and therefore its subsequent definition in software is elusive. Admitting this, we must look for philosophical advice and take the viewpoint as an exercise of pure reason to find trajectories with which to create universal judgments.\nThe use of ideological imperative\nIn searching for a unified framework with which to capture the possible entirety of desirable behaviors for an autonomous intelligent system a priori, a powerful model is presented by Immanuel Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason wherein he notes the universal problem of pure reason. “It is extremely advantageous to be able to bring a number of investigations under the formula of a single problem. For in this manner, we not only facilitate our own labor, inasmuch as we define it clearly to ourselves, but also render it easier for others to decide whether we have done justice in our\nsynthetical judgments a priori possible?’” [p.12].\nApproaching the answer requires the formation of another question regarding the type of knowledge that is desired, e.g., to comprehend the possibility of pure reason in the construction of this science which contains theoretical knowledge a priori: How is pure artificial intelligence possible?\nAnswering this requires an understanding between what we are given about the problem—what really exists—and the natural disposition of the human mind. Does artificial intelligence exist, has it always existed in an apodictic form, and how can the nature of universal human reason find a suitable answer? An answer is yet to be conceived, as the definitions that have been presented in the literature the past half century are inherently contradictory.\nA pathway to finding the answer lies in the Transcendental Doctrine of Elements, where the particular science, artificial intelligence, is divided under the name of a critique of pure reason. Therefore an “Organon of pure reason would be a compendium of those principles according to which alone all pure cognitions a priori can be obtained. The completely extended application of such an organon would afford us a system of pure reason. As this, however, is demanding a great deal, and it is yet doubtful whether any extension of our knowledge be here possible, or if so, in what cases; we can regard a science of the mere criticism of pure reason, its sources and limits, as the propaedeutic to a system of pure reason.” [p.15].\nThe transcendental aesthetic, the first criteria of the doctrine of elements denotes the following: “In whatsoever mode, or by whatsoever means, our knowledge may relate to objects, it is at least quite clear, that the only manner in which it immediately relates to them, is by means of an intuition. But an intuition can take place only in so far as the object is given to us. This, again, is only possible, to man at least, on condition that the object affect the mind in a certain manner.” [p.21]. This relates to the inherent sensibility that an object presents to the mind in terms of its representation. As in the case of artificial intelligence, this undetermined object following from an empirical intuition is a phenomenon as it corresponds more to sensation, and can be arranged under certain relations, which constitute its form.\nThe substance of the form then yields the array of conceptions that have been derived from understanding, to establish the cognition of the object and is properties both anticipated by designers and realized by engineers. “When we call into play a faculty of cognition, different conceptions manifest themselves according to the different circumstances, and make known this faculty, and assemble themselves into a more or less extensive collection, according to the time or penetration that has been applied to the consideration of them. Where this process, conducted as it is, mechanically, so to speak, will end, cannot be determined with certainty. Besides, the conceptions which we discover in the haphazard manner present themselves by no means in order and systematic unity, but are at last coupled together only according to resemblances to each other, and arranged in a series, according to the quantity of their content, from the simpler to the more complex—series which are anything but systematic, through no altogether without a certain kind of method in their construction.” [p.56].\nThis therefore arrives at the construction of an understanding in judgments. In pure intellectual form, they are presented as:"

Essentially, in the manner that a programming language is imperative, e.g., using statements that change the program’s state—as imperative mood in human languages express commands—thusly an imperative ideology comprised of synthetical judgments can be applied as an intellectual limit in the program’s behavior. In this way, a framework with a defined scope is established.\nIt seems poignantly relevant to introduce this concept now as we are formulating the most basic of laws and regulations for artificial intelligence and autonomous intelligent systems design and manufacture [3]. Rather than trying to sort out the loopholes, confusions, and contradictions, a more efficient approach is to reframe the discussion in terms of fundamental pillars of Western logic and philosophy. In order not to create more confusion or present arguments of a better or worse approach by one philosopher or the other, the work of Immanuel Kant in the Critique of Pure Reason is suitable on the foundation that, the solitary question of defining a universal framework whereby to judge artificial intelligence lies in the establishment of a criterion by which it is possible to securely distinguish a pure from an empirical cognition.\nThe relevance of Kant’s philosophy to outline substantive artificial intelligence by a critique of pure reason leaves room for interpretation of implementation but not of the essential framework itself. This is because judgments about what the program should do in terms of a system of regulatory axioms and readily traceable to the set of momenta and their empirical manifestation, rather than a random series of trial and error association scenarios. In this way, a list of cogent emotional responses to human interaction is possible given the categorical judgments reactive to a given situation or outcome. It will be for the future to decide whether our intuition can be structured in such a way as to present arguments of objects existing in similitude with our human cognition. Something must be addressed, as we are mired in contradictions about what constitutes the essence of artificial intelligence.\nReferences\n[1] P. Domingo.
