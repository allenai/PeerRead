Gene selection is a process to select genes which are more informative. It is one of the important steps in knowledge discovery. The problem is that all genes are not important in gene expression data. Some of the genes may be redundant, and others may be irrelevant and noisy. In this study, the entire dataset is divided in proper grouping of similar genes by applying Fuzzy C Means (FCM) algorithm. A high class discriminated genes has been selected based on their degree of dependenc e by applying Quick Reduct algorithm based on Rough Set Theory to all the resultant clusters. Average Correlation Value (ACV) is calculated f or the high class discriminated genes. The clusters which have the ACV value a s 1 is determined as significant clusters, whose classification accuracy will be equal or high when comparing to the accuracy of the entire dataset. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using WEKA classifiers and compared. Finally, experimental results related to the leukemia cancer data confirm that our approach is quite promising, though it surely requires further research.\nIndex Terms— Clustering, Feature Selection, Fuzzy C-Means, FCMQR, Gene Expression Data, Gene Selection, Rough Sets.\n——————————  ——————————"

      "text" : "HE DNA microarray technology provides enormous quantities of biological information about genetically conditioned susceptibility to diseases. The data sets acquired from microarrays refer to genes via their expression levels. Microarray production starts with preparing two samples of mRNA, as illustrated by Fig. 1. The sample of interest is paired with a healthy control sample. The fluorescent red/green labels are applied to both samples. The procedure of samples mixing is repeated for each of thousands of genes on the slide. Fluorescence of red/green colors indicates to what extent the genes are expressed. The gene expressions can be then stored in numeric attributes, coupled with, e.g., clinical information about the patients. Given thousands of genes-attributes against hundreds of objects, we face a ―few-objects-manyattributes‖ problem [19]. Dimensionality reduction in gene expression data can be critical for a number of reasons. First, for large number of genes or feature set, the processing of all available genes may be computationally infeasible. Second, many of the available features may be redundant and noisedominated or irrelevant to the classification task at hand. Third, high-dimensionality is also a problem if the number of variables is much larger than the number of data points available. In such a scenario, dimensionality reduction is crucial in order to overcome the curse of dimensionality [7],[11]and allow for meaningful data analysis. For the above reasons, feature selection is important for gene expression data analysis.\nA problem with gene expression analysis is often the selection of significant variables (feature selection) within the data set that would enable accurate classification of the data to some output classes. These variables may be potential diagnostic markers too. There are good reasons for reducing the large number of variables: First, an opportunity to scrutinize individual genes for further medical treatment and drug development. Second, dimension reduction to reduce the computational cost. Third, reducing the number of redundant and unnecessary variables can improve inference and classification. Fourth, more interpretable features or characteristics that can help identify and monitor the target diseases or functions types.\nIn this paper, gene or features will be selected from a group, such that the genes in a group will be similar. Gene clustering identifies groups of genes that exhibit similar expression profiles across samples. Clustering is a widely used technique for analysis of gene expression data.

Clustering is the process of finding groups of objects such that the objects in a group will be similar (or related) to one another and different from (or unrelated to) the objects in other groups. A good clustering method will produce high quality clusters with high intra-cluster similarity and low inter-cluster similarity. The quality of a clustering result depends on both the similarity measure used by the method and its implementation and also by its ability to discover some and all of the hidden patterns [16].\nFeature Selection algorithm aims at finding out a subset of the most representative features according to some objective function in discrete space. The algorithms of FS are always greedy. Our feature selection will be based on rough set; The Rough set approach to feature selection consists in selecting a subset of features which can predict the classes as well as the original set of features. The optimal criterion for Rough set feature selection is to find shortest or minimal reducts while obtaining high quality classifiers based on the selected features. In this paper, we introduce a novel method of using Fuzzy CMeans clustering along with rough set attribute reduction (Quick Reduct) for single gene selection. The attribute selection method is perform for all clusters which are obtained by the applying FCM algorithm.\nThis paper is organized as follows. The next section describes about various methods and in section 3 briefs the proposed gene selection algorithm. In section 4, experimental results are listed. The discussions of these results are given. Section 5 briefs about WEKA classification and its classification results. Finally, this paper is concluded in section 6."

Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) is a method of clustering which allows one piece of data to belong to two or more clusters[2],[14]. This method (developed by Dunn in 1973 and improved by Bezdek in 1981) is frequently used in pattern recognition.

Given that most of the experimental data are continuous, not discrete, the discretization of the continuous attributes is an important issue. The goal of discretization is to reduce the number of possible values a continuous attribute takes by partitioning them into a number of intervals. K-Means discretization method is used in this paper, in gene expression data set each gene attribute are clustered with K-Means, replaces the attribute values with the cluster membership labels. These labels will be act as discrete values for gene expression data set."

      "text" : "Rough set theory (Pawlak, 1991) is a formal mathematical tool that can be applied to reducing the dimensionality of dataset. The rough set attribute reduction method removes redundant input attributes from dataset of discrete values, all the while making sure that no information is lost. The reduction of attributes is achieved by comparing equivalence relations generated by sets of attributes. Attributes are removed so that the reduced set provides the same quality of classification as the original. A reduct is defined as a subset R of the conditional attribute set C such that γR \uD835\uDC37 = γC \uD835\uDC37 . A given dataset may have many attribute reduct sets, so the set R of all reducts is defined as:\nRall = {X |X ⊆C, γX \uD835\uDC37 = γC \uD835\uDC37 ;\nγX−{a} \uD835\uDC37 ≠ γX \uD835\uDC37 ) ,∀a ∈ X}. (1)\nThe intersection of all the sets in Rall is called the core, the elements of which are those attributes that cannot be eliminated without introducing more contradictions to the representation of the dataset. For many tasks (for example, feature selection), a reduct of minimal cardinality is ideally searched for a single element of the reduct set Rmin⊆Rall:\nRmin = {X |X ∈Rall, ∀ Y∈Rall,|X| ≤ |Y|}. (2) The Quick Reduct algorithm shown below, it searches for a minimal subset without exhaustively generating all possible subsets. The search begins with an empty subset; attributes which result in the greatest increase in the rough set dependency value that is added iteratively. This process continues until the search produces its maximum possible dependency value for that data set γC \uD835\uDC37 . Note that this type of search does\nnot guarantee a minimal subset and may only discover a local minimum. Such techniques may be found in [1],[7],[8],[14],[17]\nAlgorithm 2: Quick Reduct (C, D)\nC, the set of all conditional features; D, the set of decision features.

Fuzzy C-Means clustering is used to cluster the similar characteristics of genes GCi. Before clustering, need to specify the number of clusters. The optimal number of clusters is difficult to determine, because it may depend on different sets of genes under investigation. In this study, the number of clusters is chosen to be five and seven (k=5, 7), then leukemia data set will divide k number of groups using Fuzzy C-Means clustering techniques. After clustering, features or genes will be selected from a similar gene cluster GCi. Rough Quick Reduct has been used as feature selection method. The data studied by rough set are mainly organized in the form of decision tables. One decision table can be represented as S = (U, A=GCi U D), where U is the set of samples in cluster GCi (i=1 to k), GCi the condition attribute set and D the decision attribute set. We can represent every gene expression data with the decision table like Table 1.\nTABLE 1\nROUGH SET DATA DECISION TABLE\nSam ples\nCluster GCi (Condition attributes) Decision attributes\nGene1 Gene 2 … Gene n Class label\n1 g(1,1) g(1,2) … g(1,n) Class(1)\n2 g(2,1) g(2,2) … g(2,n) Class(2)\n… … … … … …\np g(m,1) g(m,2) … g(m,n) Class(m)\nIn the decision table, there are m samples and n genes in cluster GCi.

Here, a novel approach of clustering along with dimensionality reduction; Hybrid Fuzzy C Means-Quick Reduct (FCMQR) algorithm is proposed for single gene selection. Gene selection is a process to select genes which are more informative. It is one of the important steps in knowledge discovery. The problem is that all genes are not important in gene expression data. Some of the genes may be redundant, and others may be irrelevant and noisy. In this study, the entire dataset is divided in proper grouping of similar genes by applying Fuzzy C Means (FCM) algorithm. A high class discriminated genes has been selected based on their degree of dependenc e by applying Quick Reduct algorithm based on Rough Set Theory to all the resultant clusters. Average Correlation Value (ACV) is calculated f or the high class discriminated genes. The clusters which have the ACV value a s 1 is determined as significant clusters, whose classification accuracy will be equal or high when comparing to the accuracy of the entire dataset. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using WEKA classifiers and compared. Finally, experimental results related to the leukemia cancer data confirm that our approach is quite promising, though it surely requires further research.",
