      "text" : "Analysis of time series represents and important tool in many application areas, such as stock market analysis, process and quality control, observation of natural phenomena, medical treatments, etc. A vital component in many types of time-series analysis is the choice of an appropriate distance/similarity measure. Numerous measures have been proposed to date, with the most successful ones based on dynamic programming. Being of quadratic time complexity, however, global constraints are often employed to limit the search space in the matrix during the dynamic programming procedure, in order to speed up computation. Furthermore, it has been reported that such constrained measures can also achieve better accuracy. In this paper, we investigate two representative time-series distance/similarity measures based on dynamic programming, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), and the effects of global constraints on them. Through extensive experiments on a large number of time-series data sets, we demonstrate how global constrains can significantly reduce the computation time of DTW and LCS. We also show that, if the constraint parameter is tight enough (less than 10–15% of time-series length), the constrained measure becomes significantly different from its unconstrained counterpart, in the sense of producing qualitatively different 1-nearest neighbor graphs. This observation explains the potential for accuracy gains when using constrained measures, highlighting the need for careful tuning of constraint parameters in order to achieve a good trade-off between speed and accuracy.\nKeywords: Time series, Dynamic Time Warping, Longest Common Subsequence, Global Constraints"

      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "In many scientific fields, a time series consists of a sequence of values or events obtained over repeated measurements of time [2]. Time-series analysis is comprised of methods that attempt to understand time series, to explain the underlying context of the data points (where did they come from? what generated them?), or to make forecasts.\nTime-series databases are popular in many applications, such as stock market analysis, economic and sales forecasting, budgetary analysis, utility studies, inventory studies, yield projections, workload projections, process and quality control, observation of natural phenomena, scientific and engineering experiments, medical treatments, etc. As a consequence, in the last decade there has occurred an increasing amount of interest in\nquerying and mining such data, which resulted in a large amount of work introducing new methodologies for different task types including: indexing, classification, clustering, prediction, segmentation, anomaly detection, etc. [1, 2, 3, 4].\nOne of the most important aspects of time-series analysis is the choice of appropriate similarity/distance measure – the measure which tells in what extent two time series are similar. Similarity-based retrieval is explicitly or implicitly used in all above-mentioned task types of time-series analysis. However, unlike data types in traditional databases where the similarity/distance definition is straightforward, the distance between time series needs to be carefully defined in order to reflect the underlying (dis)similarity of these specific data, which is usually based on shapes and patterns. As expected, there exists a large number of measures for expressing (dis)similarity of time series data proposed in the literature, e.g., Euclidean distance (ED) [1], Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) [5], distance based on Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) [6], Edit Distance with Real Penalty (ERP) [7], Edit Distance on Real sequence (EDR) [8], Sequence Weighted Alignment model (Swale) [9].\nMany of these similarity measures are based on dynamic programming. It is well known that the computational complexity of dynamic programming algorithms is quadratic, which is often not suitable for larger real-world problems. However, the usage of global constraints such as the Sakoe-Chiba band [21] and the Itakura parallelogram [22] can significantly speed up the calculation of similarities. Furthermore, it is also reported [10] that the usage of global constraints can improve the accuracy of classification compared to unconstrained similarity measures. The accuracy of classification is commonly used as a qualitative assessment of a similarity measure [10].\nIn this paper we will investigate the influence of global constraints on two most representative similarity measures for time series based on dynamic programming: Dynamic Time Warping and Longest Common Subsequence measure. We will report the calculation times for different sizes of constraints in order to explore the speed-up gained from these constraints. Also, the change of the 1-nearest neighbor graph will be explored with respect to the change of the constraint size. The proposed research will provide a better understanding of global constraints and provide a deeper insight into their advantages and limitations.\nAll experiments presented in this paper are performed using the system FAP (Framework for Analysis and Prediction) [11]. The data for experiments is provided by the UCR Time Series Repository [12], which includes the majority of all publicly available, labeled time-series data sets in the world.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the necessary background knowledge about similarity measures and gives an overview of related work.\nSection 3 briefly describes the FAP system used for performing experiments. The methodology and results of extensive experiments are given in Section 4. Section 5 concludes the paper and presents the directions for further work."

      "text" : "The Euclidean metric is probably most intuitive metric for time series, and as a consequence very commonly used [1, 13, 14, 15, 16]. In addition, it is also very fast – its computation complexity is linear. The distance between two time series is calculated as a sum of distances between corresponding points of two time series. However, it became evident that this measure is very brittle and sensitive to small translations across the time axis [10, 17]. An example can be seen in Figure 1 (A) where two sequences have the similar overall shape but their peaks are shifted across the time axis. In this case the Euclidian metric will provide a pessimistic assessment of similarity.\nDynamic Time Warping (DTW) can be considered as a generalization of Euclidian distance where it is not necessary that the i-th point of one time series must be aligned to the i-th point of the other time series [10, 17, 18, 19]. This method allows elastic shifting of the time axis where in some points time “warps”. The main idea can be seen in Figure 1 (B). The DTW algorithm computes the distance by finding an optimal path in the matrix of distances of two time series D. If di,j element of matrix contains the distance between i-th point of the first time series and j-th point of the second time series, then the optimal path is defined by:\nwhere is the already accumulated distance. The Euclidian distance can be seen as special case of DTW where only the elements on the main diagonal of the matrix are taken into account.\nLongest Common Subsequence (LCS) applies a different methodology. According to LCS, the similarity between two time series is expressed as a length of the longest common subsequence of both time series [20]. For two time series and C the length of the longest common subsequence of subseries and is given by:\nThe condition is too limiting for time series, so it is often replaced with a parameterized condition where .\nBoth DTW and LCS are based on dynamic programming – the algorithms search for the optimal path in the search matrix. The types of matrices are different but the approach is the same. DTW examines the matrix of distances between points, while LCS examines the matrix of longest common subsequences of different length subseries. As a consequence, both algorithms are quadratic and have some limitations when dealing with large datasets. However, the introduction of global constraints can significantly improve the performance of these algorithms. Global constraints narrow the search path in the matrix which results in a significant decrease in the number of performed calculations. The most frequently used global constraints are the Sakoe-Chiba band [21] and the Itakura parallelogram [22]. The restriction of the search path can be seen in Figure 2. The range r of this restriction is constant in the Sakoe-Chiba band, while it is a function of i in the Itakura parallelogram. The global constraints are originally introduced to prevent some bad alignments, where a relatively small part of one time series maps onto a large section of another time series.\nThe quality of similarity measures is usually evaluated indirectly, by assessment of different classifier accuracy. It is reported that the simple 1-nearest classifier (1NN) gives among the best\nresults compared to many other sophisticated classifiers for time-series data [4, 17, 18, 23]. In addition, the accuracy of 1NN directly reflects the quality of a similarity measure. Therefore, in this paper we report the calculation times for unconstrained and constrained DTW and LCS, and we focus on the 1NN graph and its change with regard to the change of constraints."

      "heading" : "3. FAP System",
      "text" : "There are three important concepts which need to be considered when dealing with time series: pre-processing transformation, time-series representation and similarity/distance measure. The task of pre-processing transformations is to remove different kinds of distortions in raw time series. Some of the most common pre-processing tasks are: offset translation, amplitude scaling, removing linear trend, removing noise, etc. The task of time-series representation is to reduce the usually very high dimensionality of time series but preserving its important properties. Some of the most common time-series representations are: Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT), Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (PAA), Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation (APCA), etc. Finally, the task of a similarity/distance measure is to reflect the essential (dis)similarity of time series which is usually based on shapes and patterns. There is a number of distance measures for similarity of time-series data: Lp distance (Lp), Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), distance based on Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), Edit Distance with Real Penalty (ERP), Edit Distance on Real sequence (EDR), Sequence Weighted Alignment model (Swale), etc.\nAll these concepts, when introduced, are usually separately implemented and presented in different publications. Every newly-introduced representation method or distance measure has claimed a particular superiority [4]. However, this was usually based on comparison with only a few counterparts of the proposed concept. On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge there is no freely available system for time-series analysis and mining which supports all mentioned concepts, with the exception of the work proposed in [4].\nBeing motivated by these observations, we have designed a multipurpose, multifunctional system FAP - Framework for Analysis and Prediction [11]. FAP supports all mentioned concepts: representations, similarity measures and pre-processing tasks; with the possibility to easily change some existing or to add new concrete implementation of any concept.\nFAP is mainly intended for time-series researchers for testing and comparison of existing and newly introduced concepts. However, it can also be useful to non-professionals from different domains as an assistance tool for choosing appropriate methods for their own data sets.\nAt this stage of development, all main similarity measures are implemented and the modeling and implementation of representation techniques is in progress. Furthermore, several classifiers and statistical tests are also implemented. Currently, the following similarity measures are implemented and are fully functional: Lp, DTW, CDTW (Constrained DTW), LCS, CLCS (Constrained LCS), ERP, CERP (Constrained ERP), EDR, CEDR (Constrained EDR) and Swale. All constrained measures are implemented using Sakoe-Chiba band.\nIn this paper, the effectiveness and behavior of 1NN graph is examined for two most representative similarity measures: DTW (CDTW) and LCS (CLCS). The remaining similarity measures are left for future work."

      "text" : "In this section we will investigate the influence of global constraints on two most illustrative similarity measures based on dynamic programming: DTW and LCS. Furthermore, two aspects of applying global constraints are considered: efficiency and the behavior of the 1NN classifier for different values of constraints. For both similarity measures, the experiments are performed with the unconstrained measure and a measure with the following constraints: 75%, 50%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, 1% and 0% of the size of the time series. This distribution was chosen because it is expected that measures with larger constraints behave similarly to the unconstrained measure, while smaller constraints have more interesting behavior [10, 18].\nA comprehensive set of experiments was conducted on 38 datasets from [12], which includes the majority of all publicly available, labeled time series data sets in the world. The length of time series varies from 24 to 1882 depending of the data set. The number of time series per data set varies from 60 to 9236."

      "text" : "In the first phase of experimentation we wanted to investigate the influence of global constraints on the efficiency of calculating the distance matrix. The distance matrix for one data set is the matrix where element (i,j) contains the distance between i-th and j-th time series from data set. The calculation of the distance matrix is a time-consuming operation, which makes it suitable for measuring the efficiency of global constraints.\nIn Table 1, the calculation times of DTW in milliseconds are given for all datasets and for different values of constraints. Table 2 contains the same data for the LCS measure. All experiments are performed on AMD Phenom II X4 945 with 3GB RAM.\nIt is evident that the introduction of global constraints in both measures significantly speeds up the process of distance matrix computation, which is the direct consequence of a faster similarity measure. The difference of computation times between an unconstrained measure\nand a measure with a small constraint is two and somewhere three orders of magnitude. Furthermore, it is known for DTW that smaller values of constraints can give more accurate classification [10]. The authors also reported that the average constraint size, which gives the best accuracy, for all datasets is 4% of the time-series length. In addition, the usage of lower bounding (such as LB_Keogh [5]) for constrained DTW can further speed up the process of indexing time-series data. On the other hand, the influence of global constraints on the LCS measure is still not well investigated. However, it is evident that the usage of global constraints contributes to the efficiency of both measures, and, at least for DTW, improves classification accuracy."

      "text" : "In the next phase of experiments we wanted to investigate the influence of global constraints on the nearest neighbor graph of each dataset. This decision was mainly motivated by the fact that the 1NN classifier is among the best classifiers for time series [18].\nThe nearest neighbor graph is a directed graph where each time series is connected with its nearest neighbor. We calculated this graph for unconstrained measures (DTW and LCS) and for measures with the following constraints: 75%, 50%, 25%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, 1% and 0% of the length of time series. After that, we focused on the change of 1NN graphs for different constraints compared to the graph of the unconstrained measure. The change of nearest neighbor graphs is tracked as the percentage of time series (nodes in the graph) that changed their nearest neighbor compared to the nearest neighbor in the unconstrained measure.

On both figures there are 2 diagrams showing one half of the data sets.\nThe presented results clearly show that both measures behave in a similar manner when the constraint is narrowed. The 1NN graph of the DTW measure remains the same until the size of the constraint is narrowed to approximately 50%, and after that the graph starts to change significantly. The situation with LCS is even more drastic: the LCS 1NN graph remains the same to approximately 10-15%, while for smaller constraints it changes even more drastically.\nOnly one dataset does not follow this rule for LCS measure: Chlorineconcentration. For some values of the constraint (75%, 20%, 15% and 5%) the graph is the same as the unconstrained, while for other values of the constraint the difference of graphs is 34.87%. Additionally, we investigated the structure of this dataset and found that the time series are periodical, where all time series have approximately the same period. Since the LCS measure searches for the longest common subsequence, it turns out that for some constraint values the LCS algorithm finds the same sequence as unconstrained LCS. Other values of the constraint brake that sequence, which is then no more longest, and as a consequence some other time series is found as a nearest neighbor. This behavior is a consequence of the strict periodicity of this dataset.\nAll other datasets (for both measures) reach high percentages of difference (over 50%) for small constraint sizes (5-10%). This means that when the constraint size is narrowed to 10% of the length of time series, then more than 50% of time series in the data set change their first neighbor with regard to the unconstrained measure. This fact strongly suggests that constrained measures represent qualitatively different measures than the unconstrained ones. For DTW it was shown that the constrained measures are even more accurate, while for LCS this is still an open issue."

      "text" : "Although the Euclidian measure is simple and very intuitive for time-series data, it has a known weakness of sensitivity to distortion in the time axis. Many elastic measures (DTW, LCS, ERP, EDR, etc.) are proposed in order to overcome this weakness. All these measures have better classification accuracy than the Euclidian measure. However, they are all based on dynamic programming and have quadratic computation complexity. Global constraints are introduced in dynamic programming algorithms to narrow the search path in the matrix and to decrease the computation time.\nIn this paper, we examined the influence of global constraints on two most representative elastic measures for time series: DTW and LCS. Through an extensive set of experiments, we showed that the usage of global constraints can significantly reduce the computation time of these measures, which is their main weakness. In addition, we demonstrated that the constrained measures are qualitatively different than their unconstrained counterparts. For DTW it is known that the constrained measures are more accurate than the unconstrained, while for LCS this issue is still open.\nIn future work we plan to investigate the accuracy of the constrained LCS measure for different values of constraints. It would be also interesting to explore the influence of global constraints on the computation time and 1NN graphs of other elastic measures like ERP, EDR, Swale, etc. Finally, the constrained variants of these elastic measures should also be tested with respect to classification accuracy."

    "abstractText" : "A time series consists of a series of values or events obtained over repeated measurements in time. Analysis of time series represents and important tool in many application areas, such as stock market analysis, process and quality control, observation of natural phenomena, medical treatments, etc. A vital component in many types of time-series analysis is the choice of an appropriate distance/similarity measure. Numerous measures have been proposed to date, with the most successful ones based on dynamic programming. Being of quadratic time complexity, however, global constraints are often employed to limit the search space in the matrix during the dynamic programming procedure, in order to speed up computation. Furthermore, it has been reported that such constrained measures can also achieve better accuracy. In this paper, we investigate two representative time-series distance/similarity measures based on dynamic programming, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), and the effects of global constraints on them. Through extensive experiments on a large number of time-series data sets, we demonstrate how global constrains can significantly reduce the computation time of DTW and LCS. We also show that, if the constraint parameter is tight enough (less than 10–15% of time-series length), the constrained measure becomes significantly different from its unconstrained counterpart, in the sense of producing qualitatively different 1-nearest neighbor graphs. This observation explains the potential for accuracy gains when using constrained measures, highlighting the need for careful tuning of constraint parameters in order to achieve a good trade-off between speed and accuracy.",
