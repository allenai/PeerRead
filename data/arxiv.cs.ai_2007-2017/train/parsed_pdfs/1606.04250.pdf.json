      "text" : "Vast amounts of heterogeneous information is recorded and connected, e.g., in self-driving cars, smart homes with domestic robots or the “internet of things”. Intuitively, it makes sense to design intelligent agents in such a way that they automatically integrate all relevant and well-structured information on their environment that is available. Various aspects of the problem of designing such agents have been investigated previously. In this paper we approach the problem from two directions which, to our knowledge, have not been (exhaustively) examined yet: using compex simulated experiments, on a practical level, and causal models, on a more theoretical level. The complexity of the problem allows us only to take small steps though."

After experimentally evaluating the method, or illustrating it based on a toy example, we conclude both investigations with a discussion of the advantages and limitations of the respective methods. Additionally, we briefly discuss potential further experiments that could be carried out and preliminary ideas for a potential general theory for the problem in Section 7.\nA reoccurring theme in our investigations is that we try to treat as much information (including models) as possible explicitly as input to algorithms instead of implicitly encoding it into algorithms. Our hope is that this sheds a better, more explicit light on the problem."

      "text" : "Here we introduce the concepts, models and the experimentation platform we will use in the paper.\nAutonomous agents. By an (autonomous/automatic) agent we mean a mechanism which, at each time point t, takes some input from the environment, in particular its sensory data which we refer to as observation, and outputs some action that influences the environment. Moreover, by an intelligent (autonomous) agent we mean an autonomous agent which is successful in using its inputs and outputs for given tasks, i.e., specific goals w.r.t. the environment, often encoded by a reward or utility function.\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n04 25\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 4\nJu n\n20 16\nNote that in this paper we do not define a clear boundary between agent and environment. Usually, we consider the hardware platform of an agent (e.g., the car) as part of the agent. This particularly has to be kept in mind when we talk of several agents in the “same environment”: the hardware of the agents may still differ. (It is almost a philosophical problem to define what precisely the “same environment” means. Here we simply suggest to interpret this notion as if it were used in an everyday conversation. We pose a related question in Section 7.)\nWhen we consider some agent A w.r.t. which some task is given and for which we want to infer good actions, while information may come from (sensory data of) a collection C of other agents, then we refer to A as target agent and the agents in C as source agents.\nExperimentation platform “Malmo”. For the experiments in Section 5 we will use the software Malmo, a simulated environment for experimentation with intelligent agents, that was introduced recently [4]. Malmo is based on “Minecraft”, which is an open-ended computer game where players can explore, construct, collaborate, and invent their own “games within the game” or tasks. The Malmo platform provides an abstraction layer on top of the game through which one or more agents observe the current state of the world (observations are customizable) and interact with it through their specific action sets (or actuators). The advantage of Malmo is that it reflects important characteristics of the problem instances we will introduce in Section 3. To illustrate the platform, three sample observations of an agent in three different maps in Malmo will be depicted in Figure 1.\nCausal models. Mathematically, a causal model [8, 11] M over a set V of variables consists of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) G with V as node set, called causal diagram or causal DAG, and a conditional probability density pX|PAX=paX (for all paX in the domain of PAX ) for each X ∈ V , where PAX are the parents of X in G. Given a causal model M and a tuple of variables Z of M , the post-interventional causal model MdoZ=z is defined as follows: drop the variables in Z and all incoming arrows from the causal diagram, and fix the value of variables in Z to the corresponding entry of z in all remaining conditional densities. Based on this, we define the post-interventional density of Y after setting Z to z, denoted by pY |doZ=z or pY |do z , by the the density of Y in MdoZ=z .\nOn a non-mathematical level, we consider M to be a correct causal model of some part of reality, if it correctly predicts the outcomes of interventions in that part of reality (clearly there are other reasonable definitions of causation). Keep in mind that in this paper, in particular Section 6, will use causal models and causal reasoning in a more intuitive and sometimes less rigorous way, to not be limited by the expressive power of the current formal modeling language.\nNote that we will use expressions like p(x|y) as shorthand for pX|Y (x|y)."

This might be a more precise formulation, however, for the sake of an intuitive terminology, we stick to the definition based on A being an agent.5\nTo illustrate the general problem, in what follows, we give three concrete examples of desirable scenarios in which agents automatically integrate heterogeneous information. Ideally, agents would be able to simultaneously integrate information sources from all three examples."

By such information we mean up-to-date detailed street maps, traffic information, information on how to avoid accidents etc. For instance, assume that one self-driving car leaves the road at some difficult spot due to some inappropriate action, since, for instance, the spot has not been visited by self-driving cars before (or newly appeared due to say some oil spill or rockfall). If we only consider other self-driving cars of the same hardware, this experience could directly be transferred to them by enforcing them not to perform the very action at the very spot. (I.e., for all cars of the same hardware one could treat the experience as if it was their own and make them “learn” from it in the usual reinforcement learning (RL) way.) However, if we assume that there are self-driving cars of different types, then it is not possible to transfer the experience, and thus avoid further accidents, in this straightforward way.

We restrict to sources of information that are more or less well-structured - either quantitative measurements with a simple and clear relation to the physical world, or information in a language much more restrictive than natural language. Nonetheless, the formulated problem can be seen as one step from say RL into the direction of AI.\non the map. One could imagine that an autonomous agent could combine such a description with a model of the “local” (or “low-level”) dynamics that is shared by most environments (which is closely related to the laws of physics).

Instead of explicitly hard-coding each detail of an agent, for each environment and objective individually, the idea is to take an approach which is more modular and based on learning instead of hard-coding: the supervisor only determines the reward function and then the agent ideally uses exploration of the unknown environment and exploitation of the gained experience (sensory data) to achieve a high cumulative reward.\nRegarding the problem we consider in this paper, RL plays a key role for integration of information in the form of recordings of an agent’s own past, or of an agent with the same hardware. However, as mentioned in Section 3, in contrast to RL, here we consider the problem of integrating information beyond such recordings, such as sensory data from agents with different hardware, or higher level information such as maps."

Central notions that [1] uses to analyze and distinguish various types of LfD problems are the record mapping, i.e., what aspects of the teacher’s demonstration are measured and recorded, and the embodiment mapping, i.e., if the recorded actions can directly be implemented by the “learner” and lead to similar observations as the recoded ones, or if the recordings first have to be transformed “to make sense” for the learner.\nOur problem formulation can be seen as a generalization of LfD. Based on this, while a significant part of the problem we consider can be addressed by LfD methods, others are beyond the scope of these methods: Instead of hand-crafting, e.g., the embodiment mapping for each agent individually, we aim at (semi-)automating the inference of the mapping from recordings of “source” agents to actions of a “target” agent. In particular, we propose to do such a (semi-)automation based on additional information sources on the hardware specifications of the agents involved (Section 6).6\n6 Note that there is some work on learning from observations only (not actions) of a “teacher” [10]. However, this approach does not allow to inte-\nGenerally, we aim at integrating information from many different sources simultaneously (e.g., many other self-driving cars in Example 1 and many different forms of information as described in Example 1 through Example 3. In particular, we aim at learning from databases that contain desirable as well as undesirable trajectories (e.g., avoid similar accidents as in Example 1).\nClearly, we do not present methodology that fully tackles the above shortcomings of LfD methods in this paper. Rather, we make first steps towards such methodology in Sections 5 and 6."

A common approach is to model the collection of agents again as a single agent, by considering tuples of actions and observations as single actions and observations. Learning-based methods have been extensively studied [5].\nWhile multi-agent systems approaches often allow to share and transfer information between agents, regarding the problem we formulated in Section 3 they have certain limitations: Similar as LfD, they usually do not integrate higher-level information sources (as the map in Example 3) or explicit hardware specifications of the agents (which we do in Section 6). Furthermore, if the mapping from some source agents sensory data to a target agents action is learned via modeling all agents as a single one, then it seems difficult to add agents to an environment, while our preliminary investigation in Section 6 in principle allows for adding agents more easily. Also note that the task of collaboration between agents is external to the problem we consider."

This comes close to transferring experience between self-driving cars as we suggest in Example 1. However, the scope of methods reviewed in [14] is on transferring observationaction recordings or things such as policies, value functions etc. using an appropriate mapping, while the goal we pursue is to also integrate information which is usually not expressible in these terms (e.g., the map or natural language description in Example 3, or the observation of another agent in Example 2).

The task we study is closely related to LfD. However, note that usually in LfD, the target agent (“learner”) has access to the demonstrator’s actions, which is not necessary for our method. Furthermore, in our method, in some sense, the target agent can be seen as translating y∗1:L into its own “coordinate system” itself, while this mapping is usually hand-crafted in LfD.\nSome insights during the development of the method. An interesting insight during the development of Algorithm 5.2 was that while the low-pass filter only led to minor improvements, what really helped was to visit each position say three times and then optimize the averaged distance. Furthermore, it was was surprising how well the simple Euclidean distance we used worked.\nLimitations. Note that the method is limited to environments similar to landscapes where some stochasticity and variation may be contained, but not too much.

We consider the following concrete instances of the information sources listed in Section 6.1. (Note that, for the sake of simplicitly, we assume all mechanisms to be deterministic, such that we can model them by functions f... instead of conditional distributions p(. . . |pa...), although the latter would be more general, see Section 2.)\n• The specification for car k is given by its power (e.g., measured in horse powers), i.e., speck = hpk. • The experience of car k consist of all past position-action pairs of both cars, i.e., ekt = (uk(0), yk(0), . . . , uk(t), yk(t)). • The description D consists of three elements: – an engineer contributes the equation F (t) = fF (u(t), hp) for\nthe engine of the cars10, where F (t) is the force produced by the engine (incl. gears), and fF a known function,\n– a physicist contributes the equation ÿ(t) = 1 m (F (t)+G(t)) for the acceleration ÿ(t) of the cars, where G(t) are other forces that affect the cars, such as friction and drag, and m is the known mass (which we assume to be the same for both cars),\n– the same or another physicist produces a set of additional independence assertions, such that altogether the description D implies the causal diagram H depicted in Figure 3.11\nImplementation of our method. We suggest the following concrete implementation of the crucial part of our method, i.e., line 3 and 4 in Algorithm 3, based on the concrete instances of information available in this toy scenario. Keep in mind that fG, the function that maps a position y to the corresponding force G at that position and thus models the generating mechanism for G(t), is the only unknown part of M after initializing it by D.\n• Line 3: Use the experience (ek1:t)k∈C , to infer the function fG on all positions y visited by either of the cars, based on the equation\nmÿ − fF (u, hpk) = fG(y)\n10 In particular, the mechanism specification implies non-influence by all other relevant factors. 11 A better way to describe the physical forces causally might be to replace ÿ(t) in the equations and in D by v(t + ∆t), v(t), and ∆t, where v(t) denotes the velocity.\nfor all k ∈ C, and the fact that the l.h.s. of this equation as well as y are known for all positions (and accelerations) visited by either of the cars. • Line 4: calculate “p(ÿ|do(u), y, hpj )”, i.e., the effect of control action u of agent j at position y, for all positions that were visited before by either of the cars."

      "text" : "The toy example in Section 6.3 shows how in principle the integration of heterogeneous information could help some “target” selfdriving car for better decision making in situations not visited by it but by different “source” self-driving cars. It is important to note that all listed information sources were necessary for this: the hardware specifications are necessary to understand F (t), the experience is necessary to infer fG, and the independence knowledge (hp not affecting G(t)) is necessary to transfer the knowledge about the force G(t) on various positions y between the cars. Note that the above scenario cannot be tackled by standard RL approaches since we transfer knowledge between agents of different hardware. Furthermore, methods like LfD or transfer learning (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4) usually do not automatically harness information on hardware specifications of agents.\nBased on our preliminary investigation above, it seems that causal models are helpful in that they provide a language in which one can express relevant assumptions and reason about them. However, from the perspective of practical methods, it is not clear if the necessary calculations could not be genuinely done e.g. in classical probabilistic models.\nAn important question is whether the method sketched in Section 6.2 can be generalized to dependence statements in more natural - but still well-structured - language than equations and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)."

      "text" : "“Universal representation”. An interesting subject-matter of future research would be a “universal representation” of the real world, and in particular the semantics of such a representation, since data alone is nothing - it needs to be related to the world. By a universal representation we mean a rich representation to which each information source could be translated, and which each agent could understand, instead of hand-crafting mappings for each (new) pair of source and agent individually (as is usually done in e.g. LfD, see Section 4.2) Such a “universal representation” to and from which all data could be mapped would reduce the number of necessary mappings from n2 to n, when n is the number of agents among which information should be integrated. In some sense, for instance the global positioning system (GPS) could already be seen as a unified automatic representation of position. The important point here is that GPS data by default carries a clear semantics.\nInvestigation and classification of the “integration mapping”. Another important concept for integration of heterogeneous information could be the mapping that transforms a collection of pieces of well-structured heterogeneous information into a model of the\ncurrent situation or even directly into action recommendations. The study of such a mapping could build on the investigation of related mappings in LfD and transfer learning for agents (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4). Furthermore, parts of such a mapping could be learned (which would be related to Machine-learning based multi-agent systems, see Section 4.3. Generally, it would be interesting to examine the basic conditions under which the integration of heterogeneous information can be beneficial. Note that one way to classify and order various sources of information (and the mappings that are necessary to integrate them) would be from “closest to the agent A”, i.e., it’s own past observations and actions to “most distant”, e.g., agentindependent descriptions of the world in simple natural language, as exemplified in Section 3. It remains to be answered how a mathematical treatment of the integration mapping would look like. Potentially, it would be based on information spaces Gi, i = 1, . . . ,K and a function st : ×iGi → B, where B is either directly the space of possible actions, or some step in between, such as a space of models.\nFurther experiments. Further experiments, with a gradually increasing difficulty (e.g. along the ordering proposed in the previous paragraph), could be performed, e.g. using the platform Malmo (Section 2) to gain a better understanding of integration of information:\n1. Agents can observe other agents from a third-person perspective, enabling Example 2 in Section 3. 2. Higher level observations can be provided in the form of natural language (typed chat or external information in the form of natural language), or through artifacts such as maps, sign-posts, symbolic clues, etc."

      "heading" : "7.2 Open questions",
      "text" : "It would also be interesting to investigate how the following questions could be answered:\n• One of the main question which guided our investigation in Section 6 can be cast as follows. While the information relevant to an agent is usually in the form of effects of its actions in certain situations, a lot of knowledge is formulated in non-causal form: for instance street maps at various granularities for self-driving cars. How are these two forms of information related? Is there a standard way to translate between them? Stated differently, how can various forms of information be translated into a model of the dynamics of the agent in the world. • Where is the boundary between additional heterogeneous information and prior knowledge? • How can the need for information integration be balanced with privacy restrictions? For instance, one may imagine cases where the mapping from a source agent’s experience to a target agent’s action is rather simple in principle, but information collected by the source agent cannot or should not be transmitted to the other, at least not in full. • How can big databases of information be filtered for useful information, i.e., the information which is correct and relevant for the current environment and task? • To what extent is the problem of information transfer between two different agents in the “same” environment just a specical case of transfer between different environments? • How can we reason without having a “global” model such as Figure 3? What about interfaces to build global from “local” models, describing only say the engine?"
