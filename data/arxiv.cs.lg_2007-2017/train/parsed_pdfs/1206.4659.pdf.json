      "text" : "As the availability and scope of social networks and relational datasets increase, a considerable amount of attention has been devoted to the statistical analysis of such data, which is typically represented as a graph in which the vertices represent entities and edges represent links between entities. Link prediction is one fundamental problem in analyzing these social network or relational data, and its goal is to predict unseen links between entities given the observed links. Often there is extra information about links and entities such as attributes and timestamps (Liben-Nowell & Kleinberg, 2003; Backstrom & Leskovec, 2011; Miller et al., 2009) that can be used to help with prediction.\nRecently, various approaches based on probabilistic models have been developed for link prediction. One class of such models utilize a latent feature matrix and a link function (e.g., the commonly used sig-\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\nmoid function) (Hoff, 2007; Miller et al., 2009) to define the link formation probability distribution. These latent feature models were shown to generalize latent class (Nowicki & Snijders, 2001; Airoldi et al., 2008) and latent distance (Hoff et al., 2002) models and are thus able to represent both homophily and stochastic equivalence, which are important properties commonly observed in real-world social network and relational data. The parameters for these probabilistic models are typically estimated with MLE or their posterior distributions are inferred with Monte Carlo methods. Such techniques have demonstrated competitive results on various datasets. However, to determine the unknown dimensionality of the latent feature space (or latent social space), most of the existing approaches rely on a general model selection procedure, e.g., cross-validation, which could be expensive by comparing many different settings. The work (Miller et al., 2009) is an exception, which presents a nonparametric Bayesian method to automatically infer the unknown social dimension.\nThis paper presents an alternative way to develop nonparametric latent feature relational models. Instead of defining a normalized link likelihood model, we propose to directly minimize some objective function (e.g., hinge-loss) that measures the quality of link prediction, under the principle of maximum entropy discrimination (MED) (Jaakkola et al., 1999; Jebara, 2002), which was introduced as an elegant framework to integrate max-margin learning and Bayesian generative modeling. The present work extends MED in several novel ways to solve the challenging link prediction problem. First, like (Miller et al., 2009), we use nonparametric Bayesian techniques to automatically resolve the unknown dimension of a latent social space, and thus our work represents an attempt towards uniting Bayesian nonparametrics and max-margin learning, which have been largely treated as two isolated topics. Second, we present a fully-Bayesian method to avoid tuning regularization constants. By minimizing a hinge-loss, our model avoids dealing with a\nhighly nonlinear link likelihood (e.g., sigmoid) and can be efficiently solved using variational methods, where the sub-problems of max-margin learning are solved with existing high-performance solvers. Experimental results on three real datasets appear to demonstrate that 1) using max-margin learning can significantly improve the link prediction performance, and 2) using fully-Bayesian methods, we can avoid tuning regularization constants without sacrificing the performance, and dramatically decrease running time.\nThe paper is structured as follows. Sec 2 introduces existing latent feature models, as well as a new insight about the connections between these models. Sec 3 presents the max-margin latent feature relational model and a fully-Bayesian formulation. Sec 4 presents empirical results. Finally, Sec 5 concludes."

      "text" : "Assume we have an N × N relational link matrix Y , where N is the number of entities. We consider the binary case, where the entry Yij = +1 (or Yij = −1) indicates the presence (or absence) of a link between entity i and entity j. We emphasize that all the latent feature models introduced below can be extended to deal with real or categorical Y . Y is not fully observed. The goal of link prediction is to learn a model from observed links such that we can predict the values of unobserved entries of Y . In some cases, we may have observed attributes Xij ∈ RD that affect the link between i and j.\nIn a latent feature relational model, each entity is associated with a vector µi ∈ RK , a point in a latent feature space (or latent social space). Then, the link likelihood is generally defined as\np(Yij = 1|Xij , µi, µj) = Φ(µ+ β⊤Xij + ψ(µi, µj)), (1)\nwhere a common choice of Φ is the sigmoid function, i.e., Φ(t) = 11+e−t . For the latent distance model (Hoff et al., 2002), we have\nψ(µi, µj) = −d(µi, µj), where d is a distance function.\nFor the latent eigenmodel (Hoff, 2007), which generalizes the latent distance model and the latent class model for modeling symmetric relational data, we have\nψ(µi, µj) = µ ⊤ i Dµj , where D is a diagonal matrix.\nIn the above models, the dimension K is unknown a priori, and a model selection procedure (e.g., cross-validation) is needed. The nonparametric latent feature relational model (LFRM) (Miller et al., 2009) leverages the recent advances in Bayesian nonparametrics to automatically infer the latent\ndimension. Moreover, LFRM differs from the above models by inferring binary latent features and defining\nψ(µi, µj) = µ ⊤ i Wµj , where µi ∈ {0, 1}∞.\nWe will use Z to denote a binary feature matrix, where each row corresponds to the latent feature of an entity. For LFRM, we have Z = [µ⊤1 ; · · · ;µ⊤N ]. Fully-Bayesian inference with MCMC sampling is usually performed for these models by imposing appropriate priors on latent features and model parameters. In LFRM, Indian buffet process (IBP) (Griffiths & Ghahramani, 2006) was used as the prior of Z to induce a sparse latent feature vector for each entity.\nMiller et al. discussed the expressiveness of LFRM over latent class models. Here, we provide another support for the expressiveness. For modeling symmetric relational data, we usually constrain W to be symmetric (Miller et al., 2009). Since a symmetric real matrix is diagonalizable, i.e., there exists an orthogonal matrix Q satisfying that Q⊤WQ is a diagonal matrix, denoted again by D, we have W = QDQ⊤. Thus we can treat ZQ as the effective real-valued latent features and conclude that LFRM subsumes the latent egienmodel for modeling symmetric relational data."

      "text" : "Now, we present the max-margin latent feature model for link prediction. Based on the above discussions, we use the same formulations as the most general LFRM model. Specifically, we represent each entity using a set of binary features and let Z to denote the binary feature matrix, of which each row corresponds to an entity and each column corresponds to a feature. The entry Zik = 1 means that entity i has the feature k.\nIf the features Zi and Zj are given, we can naturally define the latent discriminant function as\nf(Zi, Zj ;Xij ,W, η) =ZiWZ ⊤ j + η ⊤Xij (4)\n= Tr(WZ⊤j Zi) + η ⊤Xij ,\nwhere W is a real-valued matrix and the entry Wkk′ is the weight that affects the link from entity i to entity j if entity i has feature k and entity j has feature k′. For finite sized matrices Z with K columns, we can define the prior as a Beta-Bernoulli process (Meeds et al., 2007). In the infinite case, where Z has an infinite number of columns, we adopt the Indian buffet process (IBP) prior over the unbounded binary matrices as described in (Griffiths & Ghahramani, 2006).\nLet Θ = {W,η} be all the parameters. To make this model Bayesian, we also treat Θ as random, with a prior p0(Θ). To make prediction, we need to get rid of the uncertainty of latent variables, and we define the effective discriminant function as an expectation\nf(Xij) = Ep(Z,Θ)[f(Zi, Zj ;Xij ,Θ)]. (5)\nThen, the prediction rule is Ŷij = signf(Xij). Let I be the set of pairs that have observed links. The hinge loss of the expected prediction rule is\nRℓ(p(Z,Θ)) = ∑\n(i,j)∈I hℓ(Yijf(Xij)), (6)\nLet p0(Z) be the prior on the latent feature matrix. We define the MED latent feature relational model\n(MedLFRM) as solving the problem\nmin p(Z,Θ)∈P\nKL(p(Z,Θ)∥p0(Z,Θ)) + CRℓ(p(Z,Θ)) (7)\nIn graphical models, it is well known that introducing auxiliary variables could simplify the inference by converting marginal dependence into conditional independence. Here, we follow this principle and introduce additional variables for the IBP prior p0(Z). One elegant way to do that is the stick-breaking representation of IBP (Teh et al., 2007). Specifically, let πk ∈ (0, 1) be a parameter associated with column k of Z. The parameters π are generated by a stick-breaking process, that is, π1 = ν1, and πk = νkπk−1 = ∏k i=1 νi, where νi ∼ Beta(α, 1). Given πk, each Znk in column k is sampled independently from Bernoulli(πk). This process results in a decreasing sequence of probabilities πk, and the probability of seeing feature k decreases exponentially with k on a finite dataset. With this representation, we have the augmented MedLFRM\nmin p(ν,Z,Θ)\nKL(p(ν, Z,Θ)∥p0(ν, Z,Θ)) + CRℓ(p(Z,Θ)) (8)\nwhere p0(ν, Z,Θ) = p0(ν)p(Z|ν)p0(Θ). We make two comments about the above definitions. First, we have adopted the similar method as in (Zhu et al., 2011a;b) to define the discriminant function using the expectation operator, instead of the traditional log-likelihood ratio of a Bayesian generative model with latent variables (Jebara, 2002; Lewis et al., 2006). The linearity of expectation makes our formulation simpler than the one that could be achieved by using a highly nonlinear log-likelihood ratio. Second, although a likelihood model can be defined as in (Zhu et al., 2011a;b) to perform hybrid learning, we have avoided doing that because the sigmoid link likelihood model in Eq. (1) is highly nonlinear and it could make the hybrid problem hard to solve."

      "text" : "MedLFRM has one regularization parameter C, which normally plays an important role in large-margin classifiers, especially on sparse and imbalanced datasets. To search a good value of C, cross-validation is a typical approach, but it could be computationally expensive by comparing many candidates. Under the probabilistic formulation, we could provide an alternative way to control model complexity automatically, at least in part. Below, we present a fully-Bayesian MedLFRM model by introducing appropriate priors for the hyper-parameters.\nNormal-Gamma Prior: For simplicity, we assume that the prior is an isotropic normal distribution1 with common mean µ and precision τ\np0(Θ|µ, τ) = ∏\nkk′ N (µ, τ−1)\n∏\nd\nN (µ, τ−1). (13)\nTo complete the model, we use a Normal-Gamma hyper-prior for µ and τ :\np0(µ|τ) = N (µ0, (n0τ)−1), p0(τ) = G(ν0 2 , 2 S0 ), (14)\nwhere G is the Gamma distribution, µ0 is the prior mean, ν0 is the prior degrees of freedom, n0 is the prior sample size, S0 is the prior sum of squared errors. We denote this Normal-Gamma distribution by NG(µ0, n0, ν02 , 2S0 ). We note that the normal-Gamma prior has been used in a marginalized form as a heavy-tailed prior for deriving sparse estimates (Griffin & Brown, 2010). Here, we use it for automatically inferring the regularization constants, which replace the role of C in problem (8). Also, our Bayesian approach is different from\n1A more flexible prior will be the one that uses different means and variances for different components of Θ. We leave this extension for future work.\nthe previous methods that were developed for estimating the hyper-parameters of SVM, by optimizing a logevidence (Gold et al., 2005) or an estimate of the generalization error (Chapelle et al., 2002).\nFormally, with the above hierarchical prior, we define Bayesian MedLFRM (BayesMedLFRM) as solving\nmin p(ν,Z,µ,τ,Θ)\n{ KL(p(ν, Z, µ, τ,Θ)∥p0(ν, Z, µ, τ,Θ))\n+Rℓ(p(Z,Θ))\n}\nwhere p0(ν, Z, µ, τ,Θ) = p0(ν, Z)p0(µ, τ)p0(Θ|µ, τ). For this problem, we can develop a similar iterative algorithm as for MedLFRM. Specifically, the sub-step of inferring p(ν, Z) does not change. For p(µ, τ,Θ), the sub-problem (in equivalent constrained form) is\nmin p(µ,τ,Θ),ξ\nKL(p(µ, τ,Θ)∥p0(µ, τ,Θ)) + ∑\n(i,j)∈I ξij\n∀(i, j) ∈ I, s.t. :Yij(Tr(E[W ]Z̄ij) + E[η]⊤Xij) ≥ ℓ− ξij ,\nwhich is convex but intractable to solve directly. Here, we make the mild mean-field assumption that p(µ, τ,Θ) = p(µ, τ)p(Θ). Then, we iteratively solve for p(Θ) and p(µ, τ), as summarized below. We defer the details to Appendix B.\nFor p(Θ), we have the mean-field update equation\np(Wkk′) = N (Λkk′ , λ−1), p(ηd) = N (κd, λ−1), (15)\nwhere Λkk′ = E[µ] + λ−1 ∑\n(i,j)∈I ωijYijE[ZikZjk′ ], κd = E[µ] + λ−1 ∑ (i,j)∈I ωijYijX d ij , and λ = E[τ ]. Similar as in MedLFRM, the mean of Θ can be obtained by solving the following problem\nmin Λ,κ,ξ\nλ 2 (∥Λ− E[µ]E∥22 + ∥κ− E[µ]e∥22) +\n∑\n(i,j)∈I ξij\ns.t. :Yij(Tr(ΛZ̄ij) + κ ⊤Xij) ≥ ℓ− ξij , ∀(i, j) ∈ I,\nwhere e is a K × 1 vector with all entries being the unit 1 and E = ee⊤ is a K × K matrix.

The problem can be solved using an existing binary SVM solver with slight changes to consider the sample-varying costs. Comparing with problem (11), we can see that BayesMedLFRM automatically infers the regularization constant λ (or equivalently C), by iteratively updating the posterior distribution p(τ), as explained below.\nThe mean-field update equation for p(µ, τ) is\np(µ, τ) = NG(µ̃, ñ, ν̃, S̃), (17)\nwhere µ̃= K 2Λ̄+Dκ̄+n0µ0 K2+D+n0 , ñ=n0+K 2+D, ν̃=ν0+K 2+D,\nS̃ = E[SW ] + E[Sη] + S0 + n0(K 2(Λ̄− µ)2 +D(κ̄− µ)2) K2 +D + n0 ,\nand SW = ∥W − W̄E∥22, Sη = ∥η − η̄e∥22.

One dataset contains 54 relations of 14 countries along with 90 given features of the countries, and the other one contains 26 kinship relationships of 104 people in the Alyawarra tribe in Central Australia. On average, there is a probability of about 0.21 that a link exists for each relation on the countries dataset, and the probability of a link is about 0.04 for the kinship dataset. So, the kinship dataset is extremely imbalanced (i.e., much more negative examples than positive examples). To deal with this imbalance in learning max-margin MedLFRM, we use different regularization constants for the positive (C+) and negative (C−) examples. We refer the readers to (Akbani et al., 2004) for other possible choices. In our experiments, we set C+ = 10C− = 10C for simplicity and tune the parameter C.

As in (Miller et al., 2009), we consider two settings – “global” and “single”. For the global setting, we infer a single set of latent features for all relations; and for the single setting, we infer independent latent features for each relation and the overall AUC is an average of the AUC scores of all relations.\nFor MedLFRM and BayesMedLFRM, we randomly initialize the posterior mean of W uniformly in the interval [0, 0.1]; initialize ψ to uniform (i.e., 0.5) corrupted by a random noise distributed uniformly at the interval [0, 0.001]; and initialize the mean of η to be zero. All the following results of MedLFRM and BayesMedLFRM are averages over 5 randomly initialized runs, again similar as in (Miller et al., 2009). For MedLFRM, the hyper-parameter C is selected via cross-validation during training. For BayesMedLFRM, we use a very weak hyper-prior by setting µ0 = 0, n0 = 1, ν0 = 2, and S0 = 1. We set the cost parameter ℓ = 9 in all experiments.\nTable 1 shows the results.

We can see that in general using input features can boost the performance.

Finally, it is sufficient to get good performance by setting the truncation level K to be larger than 40. We set K to be 50 in the experiments."

To see the effects of the\n2The average probability of forming a link on this data is about 0.02, again very imbalanced. We tried the same strategy as for the kinship dataset by using different regularization constants. The results are not significantly different from those by using a common C. K = 80 is sufficient for these experiments.\nsymmetry constraint, we also report the results of the asymmetric MedLFRM and asymmetric BayesMedLFRM, which do not impose the symmetry constraint on the posterior mean of W . As in (Miller et al., 2009), we train the model on 80% of the data and use the remaining data for test.\nTable 2 shows the results, where the results of LFRM, IRM and MMSB were reported in (Miller et al., 2009). Again, we can see that using the discriminative max-margin training, the symmetric MedLFRM and BayesMedLFRM outperform all other likelihoodbased methods, using either latent feature or latent class models; and the fully-Bayesian MedLFRM model performs comparably with MedLFRM while avoiding tuning the hyper-parameter C. Finally, the asymmetric MedLFRM and BayesMedLFRM models perform much worse than their symmetric counterpart models, but still better than the latent class models."

      "text" : "Figure 2 shows the change of the objective function as well as the change of the AUC scores on test data of the countries dataset during the iterations for both MedLFRM and BayesMedLFRM. For MedLFRM, we report the results with the best C selected via cross-validation. We can see that the variational inference algorithms for both models converge quickly to a particular region. Since we use sub-gradient descent to update the distribution of Z and the subproblems of solving for p(Θ) can in practice only be approximately solved, the objective function has some disturbance, but within a relatively very small interval. For the AUC scores, we have similar observations, namely, within several iterations, we could have very good link prediction performance. The disturbance is again maintained within a small region, which is reasonable for our approximate inference algorithms. Comparing the two models, we can see that BayesMedLFRM has similar behaviors as MedLFRM, which demonstrates the effectiveness of using fully-Bayesian techniques to automatically learn the hyper-parameter C. Figure 3 presents the results on the kinship dataset, from which we have the same observations. We omit the results on the NIPS dataset for saving space.\nFinally, Figure 4 shows the training time and test time of MedLFRM and Bayesian MedLFRM on each of the three datasets. For MedLFRM, we show the single run with the optimum parameter C, selected via inner cross-validation. We can see that using Bayesian infer-\nence, the running time does not increase much, being generally comparable with that of MedLFRM. But since MedLFRM needs to select the hyper-parameter C, it will need much more time than BayesMedLFRM to finish the entire training on a single dataset."

      "text" : "We have presented a discriminative max-margin latent feature relational model for link prediction. Under a Bayesian-style max-margin formulation, our work naturally integrates the ideas of Bayesian nonparametrics to automatically resolve the unknown dimensionality of a latent social space. Furthermore, we present a fully-Bayesian formulation, which can avoid tuning regularization constants. We developed efficient variational methods to perform posterior inference. Empirical results on several real datasets appear to demonstrate the benefits inherited from both max-margin learning and fully-Bayesian methods.\nOur current analysis is focusing on small static network snapshots. For future work, we are interested in learning more flexible latent feature relational models to deal with large dynamic networks and reveal more subtle network evolution patterns. We are also interested in developing Monte Carlo sampling methods, which have been widely used in previous latent feature relational models."
