      "text" : "Many organizations maintain their data in relational databases, which support complex structured data. Extending machine learning from traditional singletable methods to multi-relational data is an important direction for practical applications. The statistical and algorithmic challenges that arise from multirelational data have been addressed in a number of research communities, such as Statistical-Relational Learning, Multi-Relational Data Mining, and Inductive Logic Programming. Experience with the UCI Machine Learning Repository1 has shown that a shared repository of benchmark datasets facilitates research progress [1]. The UCI Machine Learning Repository contains mainly datasets\n1http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/\nstored in a single data table. Our goal is to provide a similar service for the relational learning community for relational datasets that contain multiple interrelated tables."
    }, {
      "heading" : "2 Design",
      "text" : "The repository is maintained in a public MySQL server hosted by Czech Technical University (CTU) in Prague. Each dataset is stored as a MySQL database on the server. Different formats have been introduced for storing multi-relational data. The advantages of using the SQL (SQL stands for “Structured Query Language”) format include the following.\n• The SQL format is a based on a standard widely used in industry. Using SQL databases in machine learning facilitates cross-community knowledge transfer and collaborations between machine learning and database researchers.\n• Because SQL is a common standard, many programming environments support accessing and processing SQL data. This includes machine learning and statistical platforms such as R, Clowdflows [4], RapidMiner, and Weka. All general application languages provide SQL database connectivity, including Python, Java, and C++.\n• The data description facilities of SQL provide a standard for defining metadata about the structure of the dataset. For example, information about the entities linked by a relationship is specified using primary and foreign keys. This metadata is recorded in the system catalog, and can be queried by machine learning applications.\nTo facilitate using tools developed for other relational data formats, we have provided scripts for converting MySQL data to other common data formats used in relational learning http://www2.cs.sfu.ca/~oschulte/jbn/DataConversion/MLN.html. This includes the Wisconsin Logic Learning format (WILL) and the .db format used in the Alchemy system. The ClowdFlows system also provides data format conversion, for example from MySQL to the Aleph Inductive Logic Programming Format2."

      "text" : "The repository currently contains 50 databases. This includes common benchmark datasets used in relational learning, like eastbound/westbound train dataset [5] or biodegradability dataset [2]. We have also aimed at providing a diversity of databases, for instance in terms of the number of records and in terms of the\n2http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/machlearn/Aleph/aleph.html\ncomplexity of the relational schema. Hence, also synthetic datasets from different database vendors are included, as they are designed to show off capabilities of their database software. An example of such a synthetic dataset is Adventure Works, which is interesting not only because of its complexity, but also because:\n• it uses both, simple and composite keys;\n• it contains a diverse set of data types, including datetime, blob (images) and geometry;\n• it contains missing values."

One possibility is to provide us with a MySQL dump of your database. Another option is to provide us with read access to your database on your server, so we can migrate the database to the public server.

The meaning of the columns is as follows.\n#Relations The number of tables in the database.\n#Instances Count of rows in the target table.\nSize Size in MB including indexes.\nType The dataset is either a measurement or synthetically generated.\nDomain The original domain.\nTask Classification or regression.\nThe name of the meta-database schema is meta. This schema contains a number of tables with information about the databases, as well as the performance of different learning algorithms on the databases. The name of the table that contains information about the databases is meta.information. Some of this metadata is automatically exported in HTML format for display on the web page relational.fit.cvut.cz. In the following, we list the names of the main column and their meaning. When we refer to “all columns” or “all rows”, we mean all columns/rows of all tables in a database. The metadata contain the following main groups of information: basic database statistics, information about columns or fields, foreign key structure, classification information."

(These are called “geographic” features in MySQL.)\ndate count The number of columns that represent temporal attributes (date, time, or year).\nlob count The number of columns that store large objects (e.g., images).\nstring count The number of columns that store string values.

Chen et al. propose visualizing the foreign key relationships in a semantic relationship graph [3]: The graph contains a directed edge from table T to table T ′ if table T references T ′ in a foreign key constraint. These columns represent information about the structure of the semantic relationship graph.\nprimary key count The number of primary keys.\ncomposite key count The number of primary keys that comprise more than one column.\nforeign key count The number of foreign keys.\nself referencing table count The number of tables such that the table contains a foreign key pointer to one of its own columns. This occurs for example when a relational schema represents a class hierarchy or taxonomy.\nhas loop Whether there exists a loop of foreign key pointers over several tables. An example of a loop is when between a person table and a university table exists two foreign keys - the first foreign key signifies that a person is studying at a university, while the second foreign key signifies that the person is teaching at the university."

The PRLR was designed with supervised learning in mind. To this end, the PRLR contains 49 ready to download datasets.
