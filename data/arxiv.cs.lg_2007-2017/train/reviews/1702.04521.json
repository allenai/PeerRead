Recently, various methods for augmenting neural language models with an attention mechanism over a differentiable memory have been proposed. For predicting the next token, these models query information from a memory of the recent history which can facilitate learning mid- and long-range dependencies. However, conventional attention mechanisms used in memory-augmented neural language models produce a single output vector per time step. This vector is used both for predicting the next token as well as for the key and value of a differentiable memory of a token history. In this paper, we propose a neural language model with a key-value attention mechanism that outputs separate representations for the key and value of a differentiable memory, as well as for encoding the next-word distribution. This model outperforms existing memory-augmented neural language models on two corpora. Yet, we found that our method mainly utilizes a memory of the five most recent output representations. This led to the unexpected main finding that a much simpler model based only on the concatenation of recent output representations from previous time steps is on par with more sophisticated memory-augmented neural language models.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Feb 2017 09:45:23 GMT  (260kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04521v1", "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["micha{\\l} daniluk", "tim rockt\\\"aschel", "johannes welbl", "sebastian riedel"], "accepted": true, "id": "1702.04521"}
