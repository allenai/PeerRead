      "text" : "Sentiment analysis is the automatic identification of the private state of a human mind with a focus on determining whether this state is positive, negative or neutral [16]. It has been extensively studied in the last few decades [18]. However, previous studies have been primarily based on textual data. With the recent proliferation of online avenues for expressing and sharing opinions, there is plenty of visual, textual and audio data of people expressing their opinions. This availability of data grants us the option of making use of all three modalities together. Multimodal sentiment analysis extends traditional textual sentiment analysis with speech and visual modalities and enables sentiment identification in videos [13,31]. Multimodal sentiment analysis has garnered considerable attention in both industry and academia. To foster the research in this area, a few datasets have been created with quality annotations for sentiment such as [23], [32] etc.\nA typical data collection procedure is as follows: researchers identify videos of individuals reviewing products from large scale corpora like YouTube. They select highquality videos while maintaining the diversity of data w.r.t. ethnicity, gender, subject\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n05 24\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n6 Se\nmatter etc. Then they split the videos into utterances (a contiguous block of speech between two pauses) to create an utterance-level multimodal sentiment analysis data set. In a typical YouTube product review, one usually consistently compliments or discredits the product. Therefore for each individual, the samples are largely positive or negative. An ideal data set collection procedure would be in a lab where individuals would be requested to contribute both positive and negative utterances.\nSentiment is correlated with individual style of expression. Different individuals can express the same sentiment very differently which is why sentiment can be dependent on identity. This dependence between sentiment and identity is statistically confirmed with χ2 independence test in one of our data sets [32]. The p-value obtained is 1.202×10−19, which strongly suggests its existence. In statistics, identity in this setting is known as a confounding factor [8, 27]. A lot of effort has to be put into annotating these datasets which is why they are usually small in size. This further exacerbates the problem of lack of generalizability of the trained models.\nNeural network approaches have achieved state of the art performance in sentiment detection over many datasets. The core idea of these approaches is to learn a representation that better encodes the information content of the data for sentiment classification. In some models, these representations serve as input to traditional classifiers (Figure 1b). Confounding factors can reduce the quality of the representations and consequently the classification accuracy. This idea is further explained in Figure 1. Figure1(a) visualizes utterance level datasets. Most individuals are primarily positive or primarily neg-\native in contrast to an ideal balanced data set. Figure 1(b) shows what happens when a Convolutional Neural Network is trained on these data. To simplify the illustration, we separate a typical CNN into two parts: 1) bottom part (convolutional layers, sampling layers, MLP) learns a representation of data. 2) upper part (Logistic Regression) uses the representation to make prediction. Figure 1(c) shows a possible representation learned from CNN on this data. As we can see, some (blue ones) are generalizable representation that are related to sentiment, while others (red ones) are user identity specific (denoted as identity-related confounding dimensions in this paper). Figure 1(d) shows that the rules learned from Logistic Regression layer. As we can see, one rule (in red) is confoundingly learned.\nInspired by how traditional statistics correct confounding factors [14], we propose a Select-Additive Learning (SAL) procedure that builds on a special architecture as an extension to any discriminative neural network to improve performance. SAL is a two-phased (Selection Phase and Addition Phase) procedure. In Selection Phase, SAL identifies the latent representation of features learned by neural networks from confounding factors. In Addition Phase, SAL forces the original model to discard the latent representation of confounding features by adding Gaussian noises to these representations. Figure 1(e) illustrates the how CNN will be like after SAL is applied to improve generalizability. We perform extensive experiments to test the performance of the stateof-art model enhanced by SAL. Our baseline is the performance of the state-of-the-art in a real-world setting, i.e. we ensure that there is no common individual in the test data set and training/validation data set. The experiment results indicate that the SAL procedure works significantly better than the original model for each of the modalities separately as well as in the case of their fusion.\nIn the next section, we first introduce works related to multimodal sentiment analysis. Then we describe the SAL procedure which overcomes the issue of confounding factors, followed by a discussion of our experimental results and conclusions."

      "text" : "For the text modality, sentiment analysis has been carried out at the word level [4, 29], phrase level [30], sentences level [22] and document level [17] extensively. Recently, deep neural networks have also been used [25, 28].\nMany works focus on the detection of certain emotional states such as anger or sadness [1, 5] for the audio modality. Sentiment level classification is still performed primarily based on text features and audio signals are converted to text using speech to text methods [10, 11]. The facial expression coding system [7] laid the groundwork for analyzing emotions and sentiments in the visual modality. [24, 26]\nStarting from [16], fusion of these modalities for sentiment analysis has drawn increasing attention. A variety of methods have been proposed and extensively discussed in recent years. [6, 19, 21] The latest state-of-art performance is achieved using a Convolutional Neural Network in [20].\nThe novel contributions we make in this paper are the Select-Additive Learning (SAL) procedure that can improve the generalizability of neural networks and improve the prediction accuracy upon state-of-the-art on three different data sets for every\nmodality (audio, video, text), as well as for multimodal fusion, in the real-world setting. Now, we introduce our proposed Select-Additive Learning procedure."

Refer to Figure 1(c), SAL aims to first identify the red dimensions (denoted as identity-related confounding dimensions, as previously mentioned) and then force the model to ignore them.\nWe use X to denote a matrix of size n × p that encodes features, for n utterances with p features each, use Z to denote a matrix of size n×m that encodesm individuals’ identities, and use y to denote a vector of size n× 1 representing annotated sentiments."

      "heading" : "2.1 Select-Additive Learning Architecture",
      "text" : "To successfully select the identity-related confounding dimensions and remove them, SAL needs a special network architecture to support its algorithm. This architecture can be extended from any discriminative neural network (e.g. CNN) that can be split into a\nrepresentation learner component and a classification component. To simplify the notation, we use g(·; θ) to denote representation learner component and θ stands for its parameters. Similarly, we use f(·;φ) to denote the classification component and φ denotes the parameters.\nTo select identity-related confounding dimensions, SAL introduces a simple neural network (denoted as h(·; δ), and δ stands for its parameters) to predict identity-related confounding dimensions from individual identities Z, so that by minimizing the different between h(Z; δ) and g(X; θ), h(Z; δ) will effectively pinpoint the identity-related confounding dimensions in g(X; δ).\nTo force the model to discard identity-related confounding dimensions, SAL introduces Gaussian noise to these dimensions while minimizing prediction error, so that f(·;φ) learns to neglect noised representation. The noises are added through a Gaussian Sampling Layer, which is fully introduced in [3, 12].\nFigure 2 shows how SAL assembles g(·; θ), f(·;φ) and h(·; δ) together via Gaussian Sampling Layer.\nIn Figure 2, the left architecture (purple one) stands for a deep learning model that is trained to make prediction ŷ based on input features X . Similarly to Figure 1(b), we split it into representation learner component g(X; θ) and classification component ŷ = f(g(X; θ);φ). This purple model could be any discriminative classifier like CNN, MLP, LSTM. In our experiment, we use a state-of-the-art CNN as described in [20]. h(·; δ) is attached to the classifier through a Gaussian Sampling Layer. The h(·; δ) could also be any representation learning network architecture as its goal is to predict identityrelated confounding dimensions from individual identities. In our experiment, we use a one layer traditional neural network."

      "text" : "Select-Additive Learning (SAL) consists of two phases: 1) In Selection Phase: it forces h(·; δ) to identify the identity-related confounding dimensions learned. 2) In Addition Phase: SAL adds Gaussian noises to these dimensions and forces the model to shift focus towards other dimensions that are associated with sentiment.\nBefore applying SAL, a model needs to be sufficiently trained to achieve:\nargmin φ,θ\n1 2 (y − f(g(X; θ);φ))2\nThis is the same as a standard deep learning training.\nSelection Phase This phase, as illustrated in Figure 3 (a), is used to tune δ by solving:\nargmin δ\n1 2 (g(X; θ)− h(Z; δ))2 + λ||δ||1 (1)\nwhere λ is a scalar that controls the weight of the sparsity regularizer. In this phase, both X and Z are available, but only δ is tuned.\nThe goal of this phase is to select identity-related confounding dimensions learned originally. To achieve this, we tune δ to minimize the difference between g(X; θ) and\nh(Z; δ). As Z only encodes identity information, the minimum of difference will be achieved when h(Z; δ) is matched to the identity-related confounding dimensions of g(X; θ). L1 regularization of δ is necessary to avoid overfitting as output dimension of h(·; δ) is typically significantly higher than input dimension.\nThe result of this selection phase is shown on the right-hand-side of Figure 3(a). All the weights of original model (purple circle) are active and connected to every dimension while only some weights of h(·, δ) (red circle) are active and connected to the identity-related confounding dimensions.\nAddition Phase Now h(·, δ) can precisely select identity-related confounding dimensions. What remains is to force the model to ignore these dimensions. We achieve this by confusing the model with Gaussian noises. We aim to solve the following equation:\nargmin φ\n1 2 (y − f(g(X; θ) + h(Z; δ) ◦ ;φ))2 (2)\nwhere ∼ N(0, σI) and ◦ stands for element-wise product. This phase is illustrated in Figure 3(b). Only Parameter φ is tuned. The input representation to f(·;φ) consists of representation learned from g(X; θ) and the h(Z; δ)selected identity-related confounding dimensions with Gaussian noises added. The noise ensures that identity-related confounding dimensions is no longer informative so that f(·;φ) can be trained to ignore them.\nAs illustrated on the right side of Figure 3(b), identity-related confounding dimensions are contaminated with addition of noises. Therefore, the model learns to discard these non-informative dimensions, and its weights get optimized to focus on the rest dimensions, which are sentiment associated dimensions.\nOne may suggest that in Addition Phase, we can simply discard the weights connecting to identity-related confounding dimensions, rather than tuning the network with noises. Compared to this suggestion, this phase of our algorithm has a distinct advantage as it tunes φ continuously because the selection previous phase performed is continuous. This advantage will be further illustrated in Discussion Section.\nSAL introduces one more set of parameters to train (δ) and two more hyper-parameters to select (λ in Equation 1 and σ in Equation 2 via ). Strategies to select λ and σ to tune δ will be discussed in the next section with the context of differently confounded data."

The text input of each utterance was formed by concatenating the word embeddings for all the words in the sentence and padding them with the appropriate zeros to have the same dimension. We set the maximum length as 60 and discard additional words (only around 0.5% utterances in our datasets have more than 60 words). For YouTube dataset, we extracted the transcripts using the IBM Bluemix’s speech2text API1. For MOUD dataset, we translated Spanish transcripts into English transcripts.\n1 https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/speech-to-text.html\nAudio Features We used the openSMILE [9] to extract the low-level audio descriptors of the utterances. These audio descriptors included the Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, pitch, voice quality etc (39 features). We split each utterance into 50 trunks and took the average of features within each trunk and resulted in a set of 1950 dimensional vectors for each utterance.\nVisual Features Each utterance video was split into still frames. We used the CLMZ library [2] for extracting facial characteristic points (415 features). We split each utterance into 5 trunks and took the average of features within each trunk and resulted in a set of 2075 dimensional vectors for each utterance."

We generate our training set and testing set as following:\n– Training/Validation Set: The first 62 individuals in the MOSI data set are selected as training/validation set. There are around 1250 utterances in total. These utterances are shuffled and then 80% are used for training and 20% used for validation. – Testing Set: We have three testing data set. ? MOSI: 775 utterances from the remaining 31 individuals in MOSI data set. ? YouTube: 195 utterances of 47 individuals from the YouTube data set, after\nremoving neutral utterance. ? MOUD: 450 utterances of 55 individuals from MOUD data set, after removing\nneutral utterance.\nWe first sufficiently trained the CNN model and saved the one with the maximum validation accuracy. Then we tested it on our three test datasets. Then we used SAL to improve the performance of the pre-trained CNN and saved the SAL-CNN with the minimum validation accuracy. We tested this saved SAL-CNN on the three test datasets. We trained classifiers for three different modalities, and then multimodal classifier is achieved by integrating the classifiers of single modality together."

      "heading" : "3.5 Experiment Results",
      "text" : "The results are shown in Table 1. First, it is noteworthy that in some cases the performance of the CNN is worse than mere chance. This inferior performance substantiates the existence of the problems we are targeting because these models are selected as the ones that achieve minimum error rate in validation sets and they can barely perform well when tested across data sets. The results also indicate that SAL could help to increase the generalizability of the trained model. On all these three data sets, SAL corrects for confounding factors and raises the test accuracies significantly higher than previous state-of-the-art CNN performance.\nAll the three datasets originate from the same web platform but they differ in recording quality and the processing done after curation. These differences show up in the\naccuracies for the YouTube and MOUD datasets which are much lower than those of MOSI. Text features again are obtained from different ASR tools for all the three datasets. Moreover, the text features in the MOUD dataset need one extra step of translation from Spanish to English. These differences are also reflected in accuracies for the text modality. Despite these obstacles and differences, Select-Additive Learning increases the robustness and performance of the previous models consistently (except only two cases: Video modality in MOUD and fusion of audio & video in MOSI).\nParameter Tuning and Hyperparameter Selection Strategy For brevity, we focus the discussion on the parameters that SAL introduces. A successful training of δ depends highly on a successful selection of λ. Fortunately, selection of λ can be guided by a prior understanding of the data. Stronger confounding factors indicate smaller λ. Extra inspections are recommended to check that λ is neither too small (δ is not sparse) nor too large (δ will be all zeros). Selection of σ can be done in the same way. The Larger confounding effect should lead to larger σ.\nAs SAL is designed to improve the generalizability of models that are suffering from confounding factors, we notice that for the modality that is heavily confounded (video modality), almost no extra effort of hyperparameter selection is required. SAL can easily increase the performance of CNN with a variety of choices of σ. However, for the modality that is less confounded (text modality), extra effort is needed.\nWe report the parameters we use in the Table 2 as an example to guide hyperparameter selection. lr· stands for learning rate. λφ is weight of L1 sparsity regularizer of φ."

Blue indicates lowest values and red indicates highest values and other colors are linearly interpolated in between.\nThe representation of utterances forms clear clusters and each cluster belongs to one individual. This figure suggests that confounding representation might be different across individuals, which fosters the argument in favor of Addition phase of SelectAdditive Learning as opposed to dropping weights.\nDespite each individual having their own pattern, there are dimensions that have generalized well across individuals, e.g. the blue vertical line at about index 100 or\ngreen vertical line at about index 20. Our model will learn to assign more weights to these dimensions after noise is introduced."

      "heading" : "5 Conclusion",
      "text" : "In this paper, we first presented the existence of a problem for multimodal sentiment analysis. The sentiment is not independent of individuals and a model could be confounded by individual-sensitive features such as appearance. Therefore, a model trained on a group of individuals does not generalize well to other individuals.\nAfter verifying the existence of the problem, we proposed a Select-Additive Learning procedure to solve it. SAL is a two-phase learning method. In Selection phase, it selects the identity-related confounding dimensions. In Addition phase, it forces the classifier to discard these dimensions by adding Gaussian noise. In our experiments, we showed how SAL improves the generalizability of state-of-the-art models. We increased prediction accuracy significantly in all three modalities (text, audio, video), as well as in their fusion. We also showed that SAL could achieve good prediction accuracy even when tested across data sets."

    "abstractText" : "Multimodal sentiment analysis is drawing an increasing amount of attention these days. It enables mining of opinions in video reviews and surveys which are now available aplenty on online platforms like YouTube. However, the limited number of high-quality multimodal sentiment data samples may introduce the problem of the sentiment being dependent on the individual specific features in the dataset. This results in a lack of generalizability of the trained models for classification on larger online platforms. In this paper, we first examine the data and verify the existence of this dependence problem. Then we propose a SelectAdditive Learning (SAL) procedure that improves the generalizability of trained discriminative neural networks. SAL is a two-phase learning method. In Selection phase, it selects the confounding learned representation. In Addition phase, it forces the classifier to discard confounded representations by adding Gaussian noise. In our experiments, we show how SAL improves the generalizability of state-of-the-art models. We increase prediction accuracy significantly in all three modalities (text, audio, video), as well as in their fusion. We show how SAL, even when trained on one dataset, achieves good accuracy across test datasets. Sentiment analysis is the automatic identification of the private state of a human mind with a focus on determining whether this state is positive, negative or neutral [16]. It has been extensively studied in the last few decades [18]. However, previous studies have been primarily based on textual data. With the recent proliferation of online avenues for expressing and sharing opinions, there is plenty of visual, textual and audio data of people expressing their opinions. This availability of data grants us the option of making use of all three modalities together. Multimodal sentiment analysis extends traditional textual sentiment analysis with speech and visual modalities and enables sentiment identification in videos [13,31]. Multimodal sentiment analysis has garnered considerable attention in both industry and academia. To foster the research in this area, a few datasets have been created with quality annotations for sentiment such as [23], [32] etc. A typical data collection procedure is as follows: researchers identify videos of individuals reviewing products from large scale corpora like YouTube. They select highquality videos while maintaining the diversity of data w.r.t. ethnicity, gender, subject ar X iv :1 60 9. 05 24 4v 1 [ cs .C L ] 1 6 Se p 20 16",
