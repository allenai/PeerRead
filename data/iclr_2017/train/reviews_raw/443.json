{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "The Neural Noisy Channel", "abstract": "We formulate sequence to sequence transduction as a noisy channel decoding problem and use recurrent neural networks to parameterise the source and channel models. Unlike direct models which can suffer from explaining-away effects during training, noisy channel models must produce outputs that explain their inputs, and their component models can be trained with not only paired training samples but also unpaired samples from the marginal output distribution. Using a latent variable to control how much of the conditioning sequence the channel model needs to read in order to generate a subsequent symbol, we obtain a tractable and effective beam search decoder. Experimental results on abstractive sentence summarisation, morphological inflection, and machine translation show that noisy channel models outperform direct models, and that they significantly benefit from increased amounts of unpaired output data that direct models cannot easily use.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "This paper proposes the neural noisy channel model, P(x|y), where (x, y) is a input-to-out sequence pair,  based on the authors' previous work on segment to segment neural transduction (SSNT) model. For the noisy channel model, the key difference from sequence-to-sequence is that the complete sequence y is not observed beforehand. SSNT handles this problem elegantly by performing incremental alignment and prediction. However, this paper does not present anything that is particular novel on top of the SSNT. The SSNT model is still applicable by reverting the input and output sequences. The authors said that an unidirectional LSTM has to be used as an encoder instead of the bidirectional LSTM, but I think the difference is minor. The decoding algorithm presented in the appendix is relatively new. \n\nThe experimental study is very comprehensive and strong, however, there is one important baseline number that is missing for all the experiments. Can you give the number that uses direct + LM + bias, and if you can give direct + bias number would be even better.

Falling back to traditional concepts machine translation while using powerful neural models is essential to understanding the leap achieved by neural machine translation over conventional methods.\n\nIn terms of related work, there is a close relation to the paper Alignment-Based Neural Machine Translation (Alkhouli et al. 2016)*, whether in the decomposition of the model into neural alignment and  lexical/word probabilities, or using a weighted log-linear combination to combine the models which are eventually used in a standalone decoder. A notable difference is that the paper uses direct translation models (as opposed to the inverted ones proposed by the authors here), and the fact that the models are trained on word-aligned data which speeds up training. As for the alignment model, the former choses to model non-monotone source jumps whereas the current paper choses two classes (emit and shift) to model monotone alignments. In (Alkhouli et al. 2016), decoding is done using a beam search decoder that hypothesizes alignments and word translations\n\nAs for the MT experiments, did you try the model combination using larger data (i.e. >=100M tokens). How long did the current models take to train on the 184K sentence pairs you are using? It would also be interesting to see how much you gain/lose if the models were to be trained using given word alignments (e.g. obtained using GIZA++). Training then should be faster.\n\n* ", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "24 Jan 2017", "is_meta_review": false}, {"TITLE": "Authors: Reviews now in, chance for rebuttal", "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference", "comments": "Hi authors,\n\nWe apologize for the delay.

The authors also propose an approximate search strategy for decoding, and do an extensive empirical evaluation.\n\nPROs: This paper is generally well written, and the SSNT model is quite interesting and its application here well motivated. Furthermore, the empirical evaluation is very well done, and the authors obtain good results.\n\nCONs: One might be concerned about whether the additional training and decoding complexity is warranted. For instance, one might plausibly obtain the benefits of the proposed approach by reranking (full) outputs from a standard seq2seq model with a score combining p(y|x), p(x|y), and p(y). (It's worth noting that Li et al. (NAACL 2016) do something similar for conversation modeling). At the same time, being able to rerank during search may be helpful, and so it might be nice to see some experiments addressing this.\n\nOther Comments: \n - Given that the main thrust of the paper is to provide a model for p(x|y), the paper might be slightly clearer if Section 2 were presented from the perspective of modeling p(x|y) instead of switching back to p(y|x) as in the original Yu et al. paper. \n\n - It initially seems strange to suggest a noisy-channel model as a way of addressing the \"explaining away\" problem, since now you have an explicit, uncalibrated p(y) term. However, since seq2seq models appear to naturally do a lot of target-side language modeling, incorporating an explicit p(x|y) term seems quite clever.\n", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 7, "DATE": "04 Jan 2017", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer3", "TITLE": "hideously late review", "is_meta_review": false, "comments": "The paper proposes an online variant of segment to segment transducers, which allows to circumvent the necessity of observing whole sentence, before making target predictions.
