      "text" : "Online product reviews have become an increasingly valuable and influential source of information for consumers. The ability to explore a range of opinions allows consumers to both form a general opinion of a product and gather information about its positive and negative aspects (e.g., packaging or battery life). However, as more reviews are added over time, the problem of information overload gets progressively worse. For example, out of hundreds of reviews for a restaurant, most consumers will read only a handful before making a decision. In this work, our goal is to summarize a large number of reviews by discovering the most informational product aspects and their associated user sentiment.\nTo address this need, online retailers often use simple aggregation mechanisms to represent the spectrum of user sentiment. Many sites, such as Amazon, simply present a distribution over user-assigned star ratings, but this approach lacks any reasoning about why the products are given that rating. Some retailers use further breakdowns by specific predefined domain-specific aspects, such as food, service, and atmosphere for a restaurant. These breakdowns continue to assist in effective aggregation; however, because the aspects are predefined, they are generic to the particular domain and there is no further explanation of why one aspect was rated well or poorly. Instead, for truly informative aggregation,\nc©2013 AI Access Foundation.

Specifically, we represent each data set as a collection of entities; for instance, these can represent products in the domain of online reviews. We are interested in discovering fine-grained aspects of each entity (e.g., sandwiches or dessert for a restaurant). Additionally, we would like to recover a value associated with the aspect (e.g., sentiment for product reviews). A summary of the input and output can be found in Figure 1. Our input consists of short text snippets from multiple reviews for each of several products. In the restaurant domain, as in Figure 1, these are restaurants. We assume that each snippet is opinion-bearing and discusses one of the aspects which are relevant for that particular product. Our output consists of a set of dynamic (i.e., not pre-specified) aspects for each product, snippets labeled with the aspect which they discuss, and sentiment values for each snippet individually and each aspect as a whole. In Figure 1, the aspects identified for Tasca Spanish Tapas include chicken, dessert, and drinks, and the snippets are labeled with the aspects they describe and the correct polarity.\nOne way to approach this problem is to treat it as a multi-class classification problem. Given a set of predefined domain-specific aspects, it would be fairly straightforward for humans to identify which aspect a particular snippet describes. However, for our task of discovering fine-grained entity-specific aspects, there is no way to know a priori which aspects may be present across the entire data set or to provide training data for each; instead, we must select the aspects dynamically. Intuitively, one potential solution is to cluster the input snippets, grouping those which are lexically similar without prior knowledge of the aspects they represent. However, without some knowledge of which words represent the aspect for a given snippet, the clusters may not align to ones useful for cross-review analysis. Consider, for example, the two clusters of restaurant review snippets shown in Figure 2. While both clusters share many words among their members, only the first describes a coherent aspect cluster, namely the drinks aspect. The snippets of the second cluster do not discuss a single product aspect, but instead share expressions of sentiment.\nTo successfully navigate this challenge, we must distinguish between words which indicate aspect, words which indicate sentiment, and extraneous words which do neither. For both aspect identification and sentiment analysis, it is crucial to know which words within a snippet are relevant for the task. Distinguishing them is not straightforward, however. Some work in sentiment analysis relies on a predefined lexicon or WordNet to provide some hints, but there is no way to anticipate every possible expression of aspect or sentiment, especially in user-generated data (e.g., use of slang such as “deeeeeee-lish” for “delicious”). In lieu of an explicit lexicon, we can attempt to use other information as a proxy, such as part of speech; for example, aspect words are likely to be nouns, while value words are more likely to be adjectives. However, as we show later in this paper, this additional information is again not sufficient for the tasks at hand.\nInstead, we propose an approach to analyze a collection of product review snippets and jointly induce a set of learned aspects, each with a respective value (e.g., sentiment). We capture this idea using a generative Bayesian topic model where the set of aspects and any corresponding values are represented as hidden variables. The model takes a collection\nof snippets as input and explains how the observed text arises from the latent variables, thereby connecting text fragments with the corresponding aspects and values.\nSpecifically, we begin by defining sets of sentiment word distributions and aspect word distributions. Because we expect the types of sentiment words to be consistent across all products (e.g., any product may be labeled as “great” or “terrible”), we allow the positive and negative sentiment word distributions to be shared across all products. On the other hand, in the case of restaurant reviews and similar domains, aspect words are expected to be quite distinct between products. Therefore, we assign each product its own set of aspect word distributions. In addition to these word distributions, our model takes into account several other factors. First, we model the idea that each particular aspect of a product has some underlying quality; that is, if there are already 19 snippets praising a particular aspect, it’s likely that the 20th snippet will be positive as well. Second, we account for common patterns in language using a transition distribution between types of words. For example, it is very common to see the pattern “Value Aspect,” such as in phrases like “great pasta.” Third, we model the distributions over parts of speech for each type of distribution. This\ncovers the intuition that aspect words are frequently nouns, whereas value words are often adjectives. We describe each of these factors and our model as a whole in detail in Section 4.\nThis formulation provides several advantages: First, the model does not require a set of predefined aspects. Instead, it is capable of assigning latent variables to discover the appropriate aspects based on the data. Second, the joint analysis of aspect and value allows us to leverage several pieces of information to determine which words are relevant for aspect identification and which should be used for sentiment analysis, including part of speech and global or entity-specific distributions of words. Third, the Bayesian model admits an efficient mean-field variational inference procedure which can be parallelized and run quickly on even large numbers of entities and snippets.\nWe evaluate our approach on the domain of restaurant reviews. Specifically, we use a set of snippets automatically extracted from restaurant reviews on Yelp. This collection consists of an average of 42 snippets for each of 328 restaurants in the Boston area, representing a wide spectrum of opinions about several aspects of each restaurant. We demonstrate that our model can accurately identify clusters of review fragments that describe the same aspect, yielding 32.5% relative error reduction (9.9 absolute F1) over a standalone clustering baseline. We also show that the model can effectively identify snippet sentiment, with a 19.7% relative error reduction (4.3% absolute accuracy) over applicable baselines. Finally, we test the model’s ability to correctly label aspect and sentiment words, discovering that the aspect identification has high-precision, while the sentiment identification has highrecall.\nAdditionally, we apply a slimmed-down version of our model which focuses exclusively on aspect identification to a set of lab- and exam-related snippets from medical summaries provided by the Pediatric Environmental Health Clinic (PEHC) at Children’s Hospital Boston. These summaries represent concise overviews of the patient information at a par-\nticular visit, as relayed from the PEHC doctor to the child’s referring physician. Our model achieves 7.4% (0.7 absolute F1) over the standalone clustering baseline.\nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 compares our work with previous work on both aspect identification and sentiment analysis. Section 3 describes our specific problem formulation and task setup more concretely. Section 4 presents the details of our full model and various model extensions, and Section 5 describes the inference procedure and the necessary adjustments for each extension. The details of both data sets, the experimental formulation, and results are presented in Section 6. We summarize our findings and consider directions for future work in Section 7.

      "text" : "Early sentiment analysis focused primarily on identification of coarse document-level sentiment (Pang, Lee, & Vaithyanathan, 2002; Turney, 2002; Pang & Lee, 2008). Specifically, these approaches attempted to determine the overall polarity of documents. These approaches included both rule-based and machine learning approaches: Turney (2002) used a rule-based method to extract potentially sentiment-bearing phrases and then compared them to the sentiment of known-polarity words, while Pang et al. (2002) used discriminative methods with features such as unigrams, bigrams, part-of-speech tags, and word position information.\nWhile document-level sentiment analysis can give us the overall view of an opinion, looking at individual sentences within the document yields a more fine-grained analysis. The work in sentence-level sentiment analysis focuses on first identifying sentiment-bearing sentences and then determining their polarity (Yu & Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Dave, Lawrence, & Pennock, 2003; Kim & Hovy, 2005, 2006; Pang & Lee, 2008). Both identification of sentiment-bearing sentences and polarity analysis can be performed through supervised classifiers (Yu & Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Dave et al., 2003) or similarity to known text (Yu & Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Kim & Hovy, 2005), through measures based on distributional similarity or by using WordNet relationships.\nBy recognizing connections between parts of a document, sentiment analysis can be further improved (Pang & Lee, 2004; McDonald, Hannan, Neylon, Wells, & Reynar, 2007; Pang & Lee, 2008). Pang and Lee (2004) leverage the relationship between sentences to improve document-level sentiment analysis. Specifically, they utilize both the subjectivity of individual sentences and information about the strength of connection between sentences in a min cut formulation to provide better sentiment-focused summaries of text. McDonald\net al. (2007) examine a different connection, instead constructing a hierarchical model of sentiment between sentences and documents. Their model uses complete labeling on a subset of data to learn a generalized set of parameters which improve classification accuracy at both document-level and sentence-level.\nWhile none of the above approaches attempt to identify aspects or analyze sentiment in an aspect-based fashion, the intuitions provide key insight into the approaches we take in our work. For example, the importance of distinguishing opinion sentences follows our own intuition about the necessity of identifying sentiment-bearing words within a snippet."

      "text" : "Following the work in single-aspect document-level and sentence-level sentiment analysis came the intuition of modeling aspect-based (also called “feature-based”) sentiment for review analysis. We can divide these approaches roughly into three types of systems based on their techniques: systems which use fixed-aspect approaches or data-mining techniques for aspect selection or sentiment analysis, systems which adapt techniques from multi-document summarization, and systems which jointly model aspect and sentiment with probabilistic topic models. Here, we examine each avenue of work with relevant examples and contrast them with our own work."

      "heading" : "2.2.1 Data-Mining and Fixed-Aspect Techniques for Sentiment Analysis",
      "text" : "One set of approaches toward aspect-based sentiment analysis follow the traditional techniques of data mining (Hu & Liu, 2004; Liu, Hu, & Cheng, 2005; Popescu, Nguyen, & Etzioni, 2005). These systems may operate on full documents or on snippets, and they generally require rule-based templates or additional resources such as WordNet both to identify aspects and to determine sentiment polarity. Another approach is to fix a predetermined relevant set of aspects, then focus on learning the optimal opinion assignment for these aspects (Snyder & Barzilay, 2007). Below, we summarize each approach and compare and contrast them to our work.\nOne set of work relies on a combination of association mining and rule-based extraction of nouns and noun phrases for aspect identification. Hu and Liu (2004) and Liu et al. (2005) developed a three-step system: First, initial aspects are selected by an association miner and pruned by a series of rules. Second, related opinions for each aspect are identified in a rule-based fashion using word positions, and their polarity is determined by WordNet search based on a set of seed words. Third, additional aspects are identified in a similar fashion based on position of the selected polarity words. In each of these steps, part-ofspeech information provides a key role in the extraction rules. In the later work, there is an additional component to identify implicit aspects in a deterministic fashion; e.g., heavy maps deterministically to <weight> (Liu et al., 2005). While their task is similar to ours and we utilize part-of-speech information as an important feature as well, we additionally leverage other distributional information to identify aspects and sentiment. Furthermore, we avoid the reliance on WordNet and predefined rule mappings in order to preserve the generality of the system. Instead, our joint modeling allows us to recover these relationships without the need for additional information.\nOther approaches also rely on WordNet relationships to identify not only sentiment polarity, but also aspects, using the parts and properties of a particular product class. Popescu et al. (2005) first use these relations to generate the set of aspects for a given product class (e.g., camera). Following that, they apply relaxation labeling for sentiment analysis. This procedure gradually expands sentiment from individual words to aspects to sentences, similar to the Cascade pattern mentioned in the work of McDonald et al. (2007). Like the system of Liu et al. (2005), their system requires a set of manual rules and several outside resources. While our model does require a few seed words, it does not require any manual rules or additional resources due to its joint formulation.\nA separate direction of work relies on predefined aspects while focusing on improvement of sentiment analysis prediction. Snyder and Barzilay (2007) define a set of aspects specific to the restaurant domain. Specifically they define an individual rating model for each aspect, plus an overall agreement model which attempts to determine whether the resulting ratings should all agree or disagree. These models are jointly trained in a supervised fashion using an extension of the PRanking algorithm (Crammer & Singer, 2001) to find the best overall star rating for each aspect. Our problem formulation differs significantly from their work in several dimensions: First, we desire a more refined analysis using fine-grained aspects instead of coarse predefined features. Second, we would like to use as little supervised training data as possible, rather than the supervised training required for the PRanking algorithm.\nIn our work, we attempt to capture the intuitions of these approaches while reducing the need for outside resources and rule-based components. For example, rather than supplying rule-based patterns for extraction of aspect and sentiment, we instead leverage distributional patterns across the corpus to infer the relationships between words of different types. Likewise, rather than relying on WordNet relationships such as synonymy, antonymy, hyponymy, or hypernymy (Hu & Liu, 2004; Liu et al., 2005; Popescu et al., 2005), we bootstrap our model from a small set of seed words."

      "heading" : "2.2.2 Multi-Document Summarization and its Application to Sentiment Analysis",
      "text" : "Multi-document summarization techniques generally look for repetition across documents to signal important information (Radev & McKeown, 1998; Barzilay, McKeown, & Elhadad, 1999; Radev, Jing, & Budzikowska, 2000; Mani, 2001). For aspect-based sentiment analysis, work has focused on augmenting these techniques with additional components for sentiment analysis (Seki, Eguchi, Kanodo, & Aono, 2005, 2006; Carenini, Ng, & Pauls, 2006; Kim & Zhai, 2009). In general, the end goal of these approaches is the task of forming coherent text summaries using either text extraction or natural language generation. Unlike our work, many of these approaches do not explicitly identify aspects; instead, they are extracted through repeated information. Additionally, our model explicitly looks at the connection between content and sentiment, rather than treating it as a secondary computation after information has been selected.\nOne technique for incorporating sentiment analysis follows previous work on identification of opinion-bearing sentences. Seki et al. (2005, 2006) present DUC summarization\nsystems designed to create opinion-focused summaries of task topics.1 In their system, they employ a subjectivity component using a supervised SVM with lexical features, similar to those in the work of Yu and Hatzivassiloglou (2003) and Dave et al. (2003). This component is used to identify subjective sentences and, in the work of Seki et al. (2006), their polarity, both in the task and in the sentences selected for the response summary. However, like previous work and unlike our task, there is no aspect-based analysis in their summarization task. It is also fully supervised, relying on a hand-annotated set of about 10,000 sentences to train the SVM.\nAnother line of work focuses on augmenting the summarization system with aspect selection similar to the data-mining approaches of Hu and Liu (2004), rather than using single-aspect analysis. Carenini, Ng, and Zwart (2005) and Carenini et al. (2006) augment the previous aspect selection with a user-defined hierarchical organization over aspects; e.g., digital zoom is part of the lens. Polarity of each aspect is assumed to be given by previous work. These aspects are then incorporated into existing summarization systems – MEAD* sentence extraction (Radev et al., 2000) or SEA natural language generation (Carenini & Moore, 2006) – to form final summaries. Like the work of Seki et al. (2005, 2006), this work does not create new techniques for aspect identification or sentiment analysis; instead, they focus on the process of integrating these sources of information with summarization systems. While the aspects produced are comparable across reviews for a particular product, the highly-supervised nature means that this approach is not feasible for a large set of products such as our corpus of reviews from many types of restaurants. Instead, we must be able to dynamically identify relevant aspects.\nA final line of related work relies on the traditional summarization technique of identifying contrastive or contradictory sentences. Kim and Zhai (2009) focus on generating contrastive summaries by identifying pairs of sentences which express differing opinions on a particular product feature. To do this, they define metrics of representativeness (coverage of opinions) and contrastiveness (alignment quality) using both semantic similarity with WordNet matches and word overlap. In comparison to our work, this approach follows an orthogonal goal, as we try to find the most defining aspects instead of the most contradictory ones. Additionally, while the selected pairs hint at disagreements in rating, there is no identification of how many people agree with each side or the overall rating of a particular aspect. In our work, we aim to produce both a concrete set of aspects and the user sentiment for each, whether it is unanimous or shows disagreement.\nOverall, while these methods are designed to produce output summaries which focus on subjective information, they are not specifically targeted for aspect-based analysis. Instead, aspects are identified in a supervised fashion (Carenini et al., 2005, 2006) or are not defined at all (Seki et al., 2005, 2006; Kim & Zhai, 2009). In our work, it is crucial that we have dynamically-selected aspects because it is not feasible to preselect aspects in a supervised fashion."

These may be aggre-\n1. For task examples, see the work of Dang (2005, 2006).\ngated without specific sentiment polarity (Lu & Zhai, 2008) or combined with additional sentiment modeling either jointly (Mei, Ling, Wondra, Su, & Zhai, 2007; Blei & McAuliffe, 2008; Titov & McDonald, 2008a) or as a separate post-processing step (Titov & McDonald, 2008b). Like our work, these approaches share the intuition that aspects may be represented as topics.\nSeveral approaches focus on extraction of topics and sentiment from blog articles. In one approach, they are used as expert articles for aspect extraction in combination with a larger corpus of user reviews. Lu and Zhai (2008) introduce a model with semi-supervised probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) which identifies sentiment-bearing aspects through segmentation of an expert review. Then, the model extracts compatible supporting and supplementary text for each aspect from the set of user reviews. Aspect selection is constrained as in the rule-based approaches; specifically, aspect words are required to be nouns. Our work differs from their work significantly. While we share a common goal of identifying and aggregating opinion-bearing aspects, we additionally desire to identify the polarity of opinions, a task not addressed in their work. In addition, obtaining aspects from an expert review is unnecessarily constraining; in practice, while expert reviewers may mention some key aspects, they will not mention every aspect. It is crucial to discover aspects based on the entire set of articles.\nThere is work in the direction of aspect identification from blog posts. For example, Mei et al. (2007) use a variation on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) similar to our own to explicitly model both topics and sentiment, then use a hidden Markov model to discover sentiment dynamics across topic life cycles. A general sentiment polarity distribution is computed by combining distributions from several separate labeled data sets (e.g., movies, cities, etc.). However, in their work, sentiment is measured at the document-level, rather than topic-level. Additionally, the topics discovered by their model are very broad; for example, when processing the query “The Da Vinci Code”, returned topics may be labeled as book, movie, and religion, rather than the fine-grained aspects we desire in our model, such as those representing major characters or events. Our model expands on their work by discovering very fine-grained aspects and associating particular sentiment with each individual aspect. In addition, by tying sentiment to aspects, we are able to identify sentiment-bearing words and their associated polarities without the additional annotation required to train an external sentiment model.\nSentiment may also be combined with LDA using additional latent variables for each document in order to predict document-level sentiment. Blei and McAuliffe (2008) propose a form of supervised LDA (sLDA) which incorporates an additional response variable, which can be used to represent sentiment such as the star rating of a movie. They can then jointly model the documents and responses in order to find the latent topics which best predict the response variables for future unlabeled documents. This work is significantly different from our work, as it is supervised and does not predict in a multi-aspect framework.\nBuilding on these approaches comes work in fine-grained aspect identification with sentiment analysis. Titov and McDonald (2008a, 2008b) introduce a multi-grain unsupervised topic model, specifically built as an extension to LDA. This technique yields a mixture of global and local topics. Word distributions for all topics (both global and local) are drawn at the global level, however; unlike our model. The consequence of this is that topics are very easy to compare across all products in the corpus; however, the topics are more gen-\neral and less dynamic than we hope to achieve because they must be shared among every product. One consequence of defining global topics is difficulty in finding relevant topics for every product when there is little overlap. For example, in the case of restaurant reviews, Italian restaurants should have a completely different set of aspects than Indian restaurants. Of course, if these factors were known, it would be possible to run the algorithm separately on each subset of restaurants, but these distinctions are not immediately clear a priori. Increasing the number of topics could assist in recovering additional aspects; however because the aspects are still global, it will still be difficult to identify restaurant-specific aspects.\nFor sentiment analysis, the PRanking algorithm of Snyder and Barzilay (2007) is incorporated in two ways: First, the PRanking algorithm is trained in a pipeline fashion after all topics are generated (Titov & McDonald, 2008b); later, it is incorporated into the model during inference in a joint formulation (Titov & McDonald, 2008a). However, in both cases, as in the original algorithm, the set of aspects is fixed – each of the aspects corresponds to a fixed set of of topics found by the model. Additionally, the learning problem is supervised. Because of the fixed aspects, necessary additional supervision, and global topic distribution, this model formulation is not sufficient for our problem domain, which requires very fine-grained aspects.\nAll of these approaches have structural similarity to the work we present, as they are variations on LDA. None, however, has the same intent as our model. Mei et al. (2007) model aspect and sentiment jointly; however their aspects are very vague, and they treat sentiment at the document level rather than the aspect level. Likewise, Titov and McDonald (2008b, 2008a) model “fine-grained” aspects, but they are still coarser than the aspects we require, even if we were to increase the number of aspects, as their distributions are shared globally. Finally, Lu and Zhai (2008), Blei and McAuliffe (2008), and Titov and McDonald (2008b, 2008a) require supervised annotation or a supervised expert review that we do not have. We attempt to solve each of these issues with our joint formulation in order to proceed with minimal supervision and discover truly fine-grained aspects."

We assume that each snippet contains at most one single aspect (e.g., pizza) and one single value type (e.g., positive).

For example, an Italian restaurant may have a dessert aspect which pertains to information about a variety of cakes, pies, and gelato. However, most of a bakery’s menu would fall under that same dessert aspect. Instead, to present a useful aspect-based summary, it would require separate aspects for each of cakes, pies, and so on. Because aspects are entity-specific rather than shared, there are no ties between restaurants which have aspects in common (e.g., most sushi restaurants will have a sashimi aspect); we consider this a point for potential future work.

This distribution is drawn from a symmetric Dirichlet with concentration parameter λB; in our experiments, this is set to 0.2.\nValue Distributions A value word distribution θvV is drawn for each value type v.

For example, a mobile device popular for long battery life will likely have more snippets describing the battery than a device which is known for its large screen. Some domains may have enormous variation in aspect vocabulary; for example, in restaurant reviews, two restaurants may not serve any of the same food items to compare. To account\nfor these variations, we define a set of entity-specific distributions which generate both aspect vocabulary and popularity, as well as a distribution over value types for each aspect.\nAspect Distributions An aspect word distribution θi,aA is drawn for each aspect a. Each of these represents the distribution over unigrams for a particular aspect. For example, in the domain of restaurant reviews, aspects may correspond to menu items such as pizza, while in reviews for cell phones, they may correspond to details such as battery life. Each\naspect word distribution is drawn from a symmetric Dirichlet prior with hyperparameter λA; in our experiments, this is set to 0.075.\nAspect-Value Multinomials Aspect-value multinomials φi,a determine the likelihood of each value type v for the corresponding aspect a. For example, if value types represent positive and negative sentiment, this corresponds to agreement of sentiment across snippets. Likewise, if value types represent formatting such as integers, decimals, and text, each aspect generally prefers the same type of value. These multinomials are drawn from a symmetric Dirichlet prior using hyperparameter λAV ; in our experiments, this is set to 1.0.\nAspect Multinomial The aspect multinomial ψi controls the likelihood of each aspect being discussed in a given snippet. This encodes the intuition that certain aspects are more likely to be discussed than others for a given entity. For example, if a particular Italian restaurant is famous for their pizza, it is likely that the pizza aspect will be frequently discussed in reviews, while the drinks aspect may be mentioned only occasionally. The aspect multinomial will encode this as a higher likelihood for choosing pizza as a snippet aspect than drinks. This multinomial is drawn from a symmetric Dirichlet distribution with hyperparameter λM ; in our experiments, this is set to 1.0."

By defining aspects separately for each restaurant as mentioned in Section 4, we can achieve the proper granularity of aspects for each individual restaurant without an overwhelming or overlapping selection of choices. For example, the model is able to distinguish that an Italian restaurant may need only a single dessert aspect, while a bakery requires separate pie, cake, and cookie aspects.\nSecond, while there are usually a fairly cohesive set of words which refer to any particular aspect (e.g., the pizza aspect might be commonly be seen with the words slice, pepperoni, and cheese), there are a near-unlimited set of potential sentiment words. This is especially pronounced in the social media domain where there are many novel words used to express sentiment (e.g., deeeeeeeelish as a substitute for delicious). As mentioned in Section 4, the part-of-speech and transition components of the model helps to identify which unknown words are likely to be sentiment words; however, we additionally need to identify the polarity of their sentiment.

For example, a snippet will be assigned the aspect pizza if and only if that snippet mentions some aspect of pizza, such as its crust, cheese, or toppings.\nAnnotation For this experiment, we use a set of gold clusters on the complete sets of snippets from 20 restaurants, 1026 snippets in total (an average of 51.3 snippets per restaurant). Cluster annotations were provided by graduate students fluent in English. Each annotator was provided with a complete set of snippets for a particular restaurant, then asked to cluster them naturally. There were 199 clusters in total, which yields an average\nof 10.0 clusters per restaurant. These annotations are high-quality; the average annotator agreement is 81.9 by the MUC evaluation metric (described in detail below). While we could define a different number of clusters for each restaurant by varying the number of aspect distributions, for simplicity we ask both baseline systems and our full model to produce 10 aspect clusters per restaurant, matching the average annotated number. Varying the number of clusters will simply cause existing clusters to merge or split; there are no large or surprising changes in clustering.\nBaseline We use two baselines for this task, both using a clustering algorithm weighted by TF*IDF as implemented by the publicly available CLUTO package (Karypis, 2002),5 using agglomerative clustering with the cosine similarity distance metric (Chen, Branavan, Barzilay, & Karger, 2009; Chen, Benson, Naseem, & Barzilay, 2011).\nThe first baseline, Cluster-All, clusters over entire snippets in the data set. This baseline will put a strong connection between things which are lexically similar. Because our model only uses aspect words to tie together clusters, this baseline may capture correlations between words which our model does not correctly identify as aspect words.\n5. Available at http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/cluto/cluto/overview.\nThe second baseline, Cluster-Noun, works over only the nouns from the snippets. Each snippet is POS-tagged using MXPOST (Ratnaparkhi, 1996),6 and any non-noun (i.e., not NN, NNS, NNP, or NNPS) words are removed. Because we expect that most aspects contain at least one noun, this acts as a proxy for the aspect identification in our model.\nMetric We use the MUC cluster evaluation metric for this task (Vilain, Burger, Aberdeen, Connolly, & Hirschman, 1995). This metric measures the number of cluster merges and splits required to recreate the gold clusters given the model’s output. Therefore, it can concisely show how accurate our clusters are as a whole. While it would be possible to artificially inflate the score by putting everything into a single cluster, the parameters on our model and the likelihood objective are such that the model prefers to use all available clusters, the same number as the baseline system.\nResults Results for our cluster prediction task are in Table 3. Our model shows strong performance over each baseline, for a total error reduction of 32% over the Cluster-Noun baseline and 50% over the Cluster-All baseline. The most common cause of poor cluster choices in the baseline systems is their inability to distinguish which words are relevant aspect words. For example, in the Cluster-All baseline, if many snippets use the word delicious, there may end up being a cluster based on that alone. The Cluster-Noun baseline is able to avoid some of these pitfalls thanks to its built-in filter. It is able to avoid common value words such as adjectives and also focus on what seems to be the most concrete portion of the aspect (e.g., blackened chicken); however, it still cannot make the correct distinctions where these assumptions are broken.

Note that as before, our model has access to the full corpus of unlabeled data plus the seed words, but no labeled examples.\nBaseline We use two baselines for this task, one based on a standard discriminative classifier and one based on the seed words from our model.\nThe Discriminative baseline for this task is a standard maximum entropy discriminative binary classifier7 over unigrams. Given enough snippets from enough unrelated aspects, the classifier should be able to identify that words like great indicate positive sentiment and those like bad indicate negative sentiment, while words like chicken are neutral and have no effect. To illustrate the effect of training size, we include results for DiscriminativeSmall, which uses 100 training examples, and Discriminative-Large, which uses 550 training examples.\nThe Seed baseline simply counts the number of words from the same positive and negative seed lists used by the model, Vseed+ and Vseed− , as listed in Table 2. If there are more words from Vseed+ , the snippet is labeled positive, and if there are more words from Vseed− , the snippet is labeled negative. If there is a tie or there are no seed words, we split the prediction. Because the seed word lists are manually selected specifically for restaurant reviews (i.e., they contain food-related sentiment words such as delicious), this baseline should perform well.\nResults The overall sentiment classification accuracy of each system are shown in Table 4). Our model outperforms both baselines. The obvious flaw in the Seed baseline is\n7. Available at https://github.com/lzhang10/maxent.\nthe inability to pre-specify every possible sentiment word. It does perform highly, due to its tailoring for the restaurant domain and good coverage of the most frequent words (e.g., delicious, good, great), but the performance of our model indicates that it can generalize beyond these seed words.\nThe Discriminative-Large outperforms the Seed baseline on this test set; however, given the smaller training set of Discriminative-Small, it performs worse. The training curve of the Discriminative baseline is shown in Figure 10. While the Discriminative baseline system can correctly identify the polarity of statements containing information it has seen in the past, it has two main weaknesses. First, every sentiment word must have been present in training data. For example, in our test data, rancid appears in a negative sentence; however, it does not appear in the training data, so the model labels the example incorrectly. This is problematic, as there is no way to find training data for every possible sentiment word, especially in social media data where novel words and typos are a frequent occurrence. Our model’s ability to generalize about the polarity of snippets describing a particular aspect allows it to predict sentiment values for words of unknown polarity. For example, if there are already several positive snippets describing a particular aspect, the system can guess that a snippet with unknown polarity will likely also be positive."

The per-word labeling task seems difficult for some Turk annotators, so we implement a filtering procedure to ensure that only high-quality annotators are allowed to submit results.

For the main baseline, Tags-Full, we assign each noun (NN*) an aspect label, and each numeral, adjective, adverb, or verb participle (CD, RB*, JJ*, VBG, VBN) a value label. For comparison, we also present results for a smaller tagset, Small-Tags, labeling only nouns (NN*) as aspect and adjectives (JJ*) as values. Note that each of the tags added in the Tags-Full baseline are beneficial to the baseline’s score.\nTree expansion Because our full model and the baselines are all designed to pick out relevant individual words rather than phrases, they may not correspond well to the phrases which humans have selected as relevant. Therefore, we also evaluate on a set of expanded labels identified with parse trees from the Stanford Parser (Klein & Manning, 2003).8 Specifically, for each non-background word, we identify the largest containing noun phrase (for both aspects and values) or adjective or adverb phrase (for values only) which does not also contain oppositely-labeled words. For example, in the noun phrase blackened chicken, if chicken was labeled as an aspect word and blackened was labeled as a background word, both will now be labeled as aspect words. However, in the noun phrase tasty chicken where “tasty” is already labeled as a value, the label will not be changed and no further expansion will be attempted. As a final heuristic step, any punctuation, determiners, and conjunctions\n8. Available at http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml.\nwhich would be newly labeled as aspect or value words are ignored and kept as background words. The steps of this procedure with an illustrative example are shown in Figure 11.\nResults We evaluate all systems on precision and recall for aspect and value separately. Results for all systems are shown in Table 6. Our model without the tree expansion is highly precise at the expense of recall; however when the expansion is performed, its recall improves tremendously, especially on value words.\nWhile this result is initially disappointing, it is possible to adjust model parameters to increase performance at this task; for example, for aspect words we could put additional\nmass on the prior for Zi,j,wW = A or increase the Dirichlet hyperparameter λA. However, while this increases performance on the word labeling task, it also decreases performance correspondingly on the clustering task. By examination of the data, this correlation is perfectly reasonable. In order to succeed at the clustering task, the model selects only the most relevant portions of the snippet as aspect words. When the entire aspect and value are identified, clustering becomes noisy. Table 7 shows some examples of the high-precision labeling which achieves high clustering performance, and Table 8 shows an example of the learned transition distribution which creates this labeling."

In this domain, each summary is expected to contain similar relevant information; therefore, the set of aspects is shared corpus-wide. To evaluate our model in this formulation, we examine the predicted clusters of snippets, as in the full model."

      "text" : "Our data set for this task consists of phrases selected from dictated patient summaries at the Pediatric Environmental Health Clinic (PEHC) at Children’s Hospital Boston, specializing in treatment of children with lead poisoning. Specifically, after a patient’s office visit and lab results are completed, a PEHC doctor dictates a letter to the referring physician containing\ninformation about previous visits, current developmental and family status, in-office exam results, lab results, current diagnosis, and plan for the future.\nFor this experiment, we select phrases from the in-office exam and lab results sections of the summaries. Phrases are separated heuristically on commas and semicolons. In a domain which contains a significant amount of extraneous information, such as the restaurant domain, we must extract phrases which we believe bear some relevance to the task at hand. However, because the medical text is dense and nearly all relevant, a heuristic separation is sufficient to extract relevant phrases. There are 6198 snippets in total, taken from 271 summaries. The average snippet length is 4.5 words, and there are an average of 23 snippets per summary. As in the Yelp domain, we use the MXPOST tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996) to gain POS tags. Figure 12 shows some example snippets. For this domain, there are no values; we simply concentrate on the aspect-identification task. Unlike the restaurant domain, we use no seed words."
    }, {
      "heading" : "6.2.2 Domain Challenges and Modeling Techniques",
      "text" : "In contrast to the restaurant domain, the medical domain uses a single global set of aspects. These represent either individual lab tests (e.g., lead level, white blood cell count) or particular body systems (e.g., lungs or cardiovascular). Some aspects are far more common than others, and it is very uncommon for a summary to include more than one or two snippets about any given aspect. Therefore, as mentioned in Section 4.2, we model the aspect word distributions and the aspect multinomial as shared between all entities in the corpus.\nAlso in contrast to the restaurant domain, aspects are defined by words taken from the entire snippet. Rather than having aspects only associated with names of measurements (e.g., ‘weight’), units and other descriptions of measurement (e.g., ‘kilograms’) are also relevant for aspect definition. This property extends to both numeric and written measurements; for example, the aspect ‘lungs’ is commonly described as ‘clear to auscultation bilaterally’. In order to achieve high performance, our model must leverage all of these clues to provide proper aspect identification when the name of the measurement is missing (e.g., “patient is 100 cm”). While part of speech will still be an important factor to model, we predict that there will be greater importance on additional parts of speech other than nouns.\nFinally, our data set is noisy and contains some irrelevant snippets, such as section headings (e.g., “Physical examination and review of systems”) or extraneous information. As described in Section 4.2, we modify our model so that it can ignore partial or complete snippets."

      "heading" : "6.2.3 Cluster Prediction",
      "text" : "As for joint aspect and sentiment prediction, the goal of this task is to evaluate the quality of aspect identification. Because the aspects are shared across all documents, clusters are generally much larger, and the set of annotated snippets represents only a fraction of each cluster.\nAnnotation For this experiment, we use a set of gold clusters gathered over 1,200 snippets, annotated by a doctor who is an expert in the domain from the Pediatric Environmental Health Clinic at Children’s Hospital Boston. Note that as mentioned before, clusters\nhere are global to the domain (e.g., many patients have snippets representing blood lead level, and these are all grouped into one cluster). The doctor was asked to cluster 100 snippets at a time (spanning several patients), as clustering the entire set would have been infeasible for a human annotator. After all 12 sets of snippets were clustered, the resulting clusters were manually combined to match up similar clusters from each set. For example, the blood lead level cluster from the first set of 100 snippets was combined with the corresponding blood lead level clusters from each other set of snippets. Any cluster from this final set with fewer than 5 members was removed. In total, this yields a gold set of 30 clusters. There are 1,053 snippets total, for an average of 35.1 snippets per cluster. To match this, baseline systems and our full model are asked to produce 30 clusters across the full data set.\nBaselines & Metric To keep these results consistent with those on the previous task, we use the same baselines and evaluation metric. Both baselines rely on a TF*IDFweighted clustering algorithm, specifically implemented with CLUTO package (Karypis, 2002) using agglomerative clustering with the cosine similarity distance metric. As before, Cluster-All represents a baseline using unigrams of snippets from the entire data set, while Cluster-Noun works over only the nouns from the snippets. We again use the MUC cluster evaluation metric for this task. For more details on both baselines and the evaluation metric, please see Section 6.1.3.\nResults For this experiment, our system demonstrates an improvement of 7% over the Cluster-All baseline. Absolute performance is relatively high for all systems in the medical domain, indicating that the lexical clustering task is less misleading than in the restaurant domain. It is interesting to note that unlike in the restaurant domain, the Cluster-All baseline outperforms the Cluster-Noun baseline. As mentioned in Section 6.2.2, the medical data is notable for the relevance of the entire snippet for clustering (e.g., both ‘weight’ and ‘kilograms’ are useful to identify the weight aspect). Because of this property, using only nouns to cluster in the Cluster-Noun baseline hurts performance significantly."

      "heading" : "7. Conclusions and Future Work",
      "text" : "In this paper, we have presented an approach for fine-grained content aggregation using probabilistic topic modeling techniques to discover the structure of individual text snippets. Our model is able to successfully identify clusters of snippets in a data set which discuss the same aspect of an entity as well as the associated values (e.g., sentiment). It requires no annotation, other than a small list of seed vocabulary to bias the positive and negative distributions in the proper direction.\nOur results demonstrate that delving into the structure of the snippet can assist in identifying key words which are important and unique to the domain at hand. When there are values to be learned, the joint identification of aspect and value can help to improve the quality of the results. The word labeling analysis reveals that the model learns a different type of labeling for each task; specifically, a strict, high-precision labeling for the clustering task and a high-recall labeling for sentiment. This follows the intuition that it is important to identify specific main points for clustering, while in the sentiment analysis task, there may often be several descriptions or conflicting opinions presented which all need to be weighed together to determine the overall sentiment.\nThis model admits a fast, parallelized inference procedure. Specifically, the entire inference procedure takes roughly 15 minutes to run on the restaurant corpus and less than 5 minutes on the medical corpus. Additionally, the model is neatly extensible and adjustable to fit the particular characteristics of a given domain.\nThere are a few limitations of this model which can be improved with future work: First, our model makes no attempt to explicitly model negation or other word interactions, increasing the difficulty of both aspect and sentiment analysis for our model. By performing error analysis, we find that negation is a common source of error for the sentiment analysis task. Likewise, on the aspect side, the model can make errors when attempting to differentiate aspects such as ice cream and cream cheese which share the common aspect word cream, despite these phrases occurring as bigrams. By using these connections in a stronger way, such as with an indicator variable for negation or a higher-order HMM, the model could make more informed decisions.\nSecond, while defining aspects per-entity as in the restaurant domain has advantages in that it is possible to get a very fine-grained set of applicable aspects, it also fails to leverage some potential information in the data set. Specifically, we know that restaurants sharing the same type (e.g., Italian, Indian, Bakery, etc.) should share some common aspects; however, there are no ties between them in the current model. Likewise, even at a global\nlevel, there may be some aspects which tie in across all restaurants. A hierarchical version of this model would be able to tie these together and identify different types of aspects: global (e.g., presentation), type-level (e.g., pasta for the Italian type), and restaurant-level (e.g., the restaurant’s special dish).\nBibliographic Note\nPortions of this paper have been published previously in a conference publication (Sauper, Haghighi, & Barzilay, 2011); however this paper significantly extends that work. We describe several model generalizations and extensions (Section 4.2) and their effects on our inference procedure (Section 5.2). We present new experimental results, including additional baseline comparisons and an additional experiment (Section 6.1). We also introduce a new domain, medical summary text, which is quite different than the domain of restaurant reviews and therefore requires several fundamental changes to the model (Section 6.2)."

While the aspects produced are comparable across reviews for a particular product, the highly-supervised nature means that this approach is not feasible for a large set of products such as our corpus of reviews from many types of restaurants. Instead, we must be able to dynamically identify relevant aspects.

While we share a common goal of identifying and aggregating opinion-bearing aspects, we additionally desire to identify the polarity of opinions, a task not addressed in their work. In addition, obtaining aspects from an expert review is unnecessarily constraining; in practice, while expert reviewers may mention some key aspects, they will not mention every aspect. It is crucial to discover aspects based on the entire set of articles. There is work in the direction of aspect identification from blog posts. For example, Mei et al.

It is also easily extensible, and we describe several modifications and their effects on model structure and inference. We test our model on two tasks, joint aspect identification and sentiment analysis on a set of Yelp reviews and aspect identification alone on a set of medical summaries. We evaluate the performance of the model on aspect identification, sentiment analysis, and per-word labeling accuracy.
