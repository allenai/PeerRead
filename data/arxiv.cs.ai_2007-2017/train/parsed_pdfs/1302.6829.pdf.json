It is based on fuzzy constraints represented as fuzzy geometric relations that can be hierarchically structured. The concept of spatial template is introduced to capture the idea of interrelated objects in two­ dimensional space. The representation model is used to specify imprecise or vague information consisting in relative locations and orientations of template objects. It is shown in this paper how a template represented by this model can be matched against a crisp situation to recognize a particular instance of this template. Furthermore, the proximity measure (fuzzy measure) between the instance and the template is worked out this measure can be interpreted as a degree of similarity. In this context, template recognition can be viewed as a case of fuzzy pattern recognition. The results of this work have been implemented and applied to a complex military problem from which this work originated.",
