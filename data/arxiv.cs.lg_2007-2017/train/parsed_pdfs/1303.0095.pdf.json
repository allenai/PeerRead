      "text" : "Classification is one of most important concepts in Machine Learning. It is usually based on the data that represents relationships between a fixed set of attributes and one target class. These relations describe each object independently that means no direct correlations between objects in the classification phase are taken into account. An exception may be additional input features, which aggregate information about the entire group a given object belongs to. However, it requires any clustering process be launched before. There are some applications and research methods, especially related to social networks, which are able to produce data with dependencies between labels of interconnected objects, referred as relational autocorrelation [16]. Based on these connections additional input information should be added to the classification process. If the considered objects are humans and the classification is utilized on their profiles then the social network can be extracted from complementary data (different from people’s profiles) about common activities and mutual communication [9, 10, 15]. Overall, a social network is a set of nodes (human entities, objects) and node-node relationship between pairs of nodes [18]. According to [17], all network objects may be described by three distinct types of information that can be easily used in label classification: correlation between the object’s label (class) and its attributes, correlation between the object’s label and the observed (known) labels of other objects in its neighborhood and, consequently, correlation between the object’s label and unobserved (unknown) labels of other objects in its neighborhood.\nBasic task of within-network classification [1, 12] is to assign the correct labels to the unlabeled nodes from a set of the possible class labels. For example, based on the network of communication interactions, it could be determined whether a given company’s employee is either an executive or a performer. Willing to obtain the best possible results of classification, all three types of information should be evaluated: nodes attributes (profiles), node-node network relations to the known labels in the neighborhood (labeled neighbors) and relations to the neighboring objects with unknown labels. Main difficulty here is to extract the set of most discriminative features from the network nodes and their connections to achieve the best classification model.\nA new approach for network feature extraction is proposed in further sections. Some of these structural features have discriminative distribution, which may directly influence classification performance.\nSection 2 covers related work while in Section 3 appears main part of the paper, where a new method for network feature extraction is presented. Sections 4 and 5, contain descriptions of the experimental setup and the obtained results, respectively. The paper is concluded in Section 6."

      "text" : "In recent years, there has appeared a great number of works describing models and techniques for classification in network data. Analogously to classical machine learning problems, classification in network data requires specialized solutions for feature extraction, high performance supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, sparse data handling, etc.\nIn general, network classification problems, may be solved using two main approaches: by within-network and across-network inference. Within-network classification, for which training entities are connected directly to entities, whose labels are to be classified, stays in contrast to across-network classification, where models learnt from one network are applied to another similar network [11]. Overall, the networked data have several unique characteristics that simultaneously complicate and provide leverage to learning and classification. More generally, network data allow the use of the features of the node’s neighbors to label them, although it must be performed with care to avoid increase of variance estimation [7].\nThere have been developed many algorithms and models for classification in the network. Among others, statistical relational learning (SRL) techniques were introduced, including probabilistic relational models, relational Markov networks, and probabilistic entity-relationship models [2, 6, 13, 16]. Two distinct types of classification in networks may be distinguished: based on collection of local conditional classifiers and based on the classification stated as one global objective function. The most known implementations of the first approach are iterative classification (ICA) and Gibbs sampling algorithm (GS), whereas example of the latter are loopy belief propagation (LBP) and mean-field relaxation labeling (MF) [17]. Generally speaking, there exist many pretty effective algorithms of collective classification as well as graph-based semi-supervised learning methods. It refers,\nespecially logForest, a logistic model based on links, wvRN, a relational neighbor model, SSL Gaussian random field model, ghostEdge, combination of statistical relational learning and semi-supervised learning for sparse networks and theirs collective classification supplements [5].\nOne of the most crucial problems in the network classification is feature extraction. According to [4] the derived features are divided into two categories: label-dependent (LD) and label-independent (LI). Features LD use both structure of the network as well as information about labels of the neighboring nodes labels, e.g. number of neighbors with given class label. Features LI, in turn, are calculated using the network structure only, e.g. betweenness of a node. The LI like features, therefore, are independent from the distribution of labels in the network and might not be informative. However, they can be perfectly calculated regardless of the availability of labels. What is worth mentioning, most of the proposed network classification methods were usually applied to the data sets with very limited access to labels. Their authors assumed that their applications need to deal even with only 1% labeled nodes. This problem is known as classification in sparsely labeled networks [4, 5].\nIt appears that the majority of network-based structural measures used as features in network classification may be useful and may potentially improve classification performance.\nSocial networks, being a network representation of interactions between people is a subject of research in terms of classification in networks as well [4]."

A single vector corresponding to node vi contains all information from xi as well as some additional information (new attributes) derived by feature extraction methods based on the network profile. Next, the obtained set of vectors is used in classical, supervised classification."

As mentioned in Section 1, the generated features may be label-independent or label-dependent. For clarity, while describing labeldependent features, it is made a basic assumption in the paper that feature extraction is based only on correlation between the object’s label and the observed labels of other objects in its neighborhood see Fig. 1.\nThree examples of basic label-independent and three label-dependent features are presented in the following sub-sections, as well as generalization for label-dependent features extraction."

      "heading" : "3.2.2 Label-dependent Features",
      "text" : "While introducing label-dependent features two manners of their formation are proposed. Both of them relay on the idea of selective definition of sub-networks based on the labels assigned to each node. It means that a sub-network for a given label l consists of only those nodes that share label (class) l together with all edges connecting these selected nodes. For that purpose, a new selection operator O(G,l) for graph G and label l is defined. It returns a sub-network Gl labeled with l: Gl=(Vl, El, Xl, {l}, Yl, Wl) such that Vl={vi: <vi,l>Yl}, Yl={<vi,yl>: viVyl=l}, El={eij: vi,vjVleijE}, Xl={xl: vlVlxlX}.\nAfterwards, for each sub-network Gl (each label l), new features are computed. First group of label-dependent features composition is based on new custom measures derived from the interaction between a given node and its neighboring nodes only. The measures take into consideration either the number of connections or their strengths.\nNormalized Number of Connections to the Labeled neighbors The measure for the normalized number of connections to the labeled neighbors NCN(G,l,vi) represents the proportion of the number of connections to the neighboring nodes in the sub-network with label l (Gl) by the number of connections to the labeled neighbors in the whole primary graph G (with all labels). The measure NCN(G,l,vi) is defined as follows:\n   ),( )),,((),,( iL i i vGncard vlGOncardvlGNCN  , (4)\nwhere: n(O(G,l),vi) - a set of the neighboring nodes for node vi in sub-network O(G,l), nL(G,vi) - a set of vi‘s labeled neighbors in graph G, each neighbor must be labeled with any label lL.\nNote that the value of card(n(O(G,l),vi)) is the same as the number of connections between vi and vi’s neighbors (each vi’s neighbor has one connection with vi). Similarly, the value of card(nL(G,vi)) equals the number of connections between vi and all vi’s labeled (and only labeled) neighbors.\nThe measure NCN(G,l,vi) is computed separately for each label l and in general, for two labels lk and lm, the value of NCN(G,lk,vi) may differ from NCN(G,lm,vi). For the example network from Fig. 2, and the measure NCN(G,’red’,v1) calculated for node 1 in the sub-network with nodes labeled with the ‘red’ class, the value of NCN(G,’red’,v1) is 4 divided by 8 (total number of nodes in graph G).\nNormalized Sum of Connection Strengths to the Labeled Neighbors The value of the normalized sum of connection strengths to the labeled neighbors NCS(G,l,vi) is the proportion of node vi’s activity towards vi’s neighbors (measured by the aggregated connection strengths) in the sub-network with label l (Gl) normalized by the equivalent value of strengths to the neighbors with any label in the whole graph G. The value of NCS(G,l,vi) for graph G and label l is expressed in the following way:\n \n\n \n),(\n)),,(( ),,(\niLj\nij\nvGnv ij\nvlGOnv ij\ni w\nw\nvlGNCS , (5)\nSimilarly to NCN(G,l,vi), the measure NCS(G,l,vi) is evaluated separately for each label l and differs for different labels l. For the network from Fig. 2, the measure NCS(G,’red’,v1) is computed for node 1 and label (class) ‘red’, as the sum of w13, w14, w17, and w18 normalized by sum of all eight connection strengths."

Majority of them is labelindependent and it is possible to define many methods that will extract labeldependent features based on them. A general concept of creation of any labeldependent feature Ml(G,l,vi) for label l and node vi in the social network G applies label-independent feature M to the appropriate labeled sub-network Gl=O(G,l), as follows: Ml(G,l,vi)=M(Gl,vi), (6) where: Ml(Gl,vi) - denotes any structural network measure for node vi applied to sub-network Gl=O(G,l), e.g degree, betweennes or clustering coefficient; Obviously, Ml(G,l,vi) is computed separately for each label l using the appropriate sub-network Gl=O(G,l).

The AMD data set was an output of a project, which used RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology to help connect conference participants at “The Last HOPE” Conference held in July 18-20, 2008, New York City, USA. All attendees received an RFID badges that uniquely identified and tracked them across the conference space. The data set contains descriptions of\ninterests of participants, their interactions via instant messages, as well as their location over the course of the conference. Conference attendees were asked to \"tag\" themselves based on a diverse set of interests. Thanks to location tracking, a list of attendances was extracted for each conference talk. Additionally, participants could email or send a text message to \"ping\" the people who had similar interests.\nIn general, the data set contains information about conference participants, conference talks and presence on talks. Initial import contained 767 different persons, 99 talks, 10,110 presences reported during talks. In the cleaning process, these contributors who did not give any information about their interests were excluded from further studies. As a result, 334 persons with 99 lectures and 3,141 presences have left after cleaning.\nAfterwards, the social network was build. Ties in the network were constructed based on the fact that participants were present on the same talks. Moreover, strengths of the connections between each pair of contributors were calculated as the proportion of number of talks attended by both participants by the total number of talk presences of the first participant. It provided 68,770 directed, weighted connections, with histogram presented in the Fig. 3.\nThe raw data contained 4 attributes: 3 nominal (sex, cell phone provider, country) and 1 numerical (age). Additionally, each participant was described by unordered set of interests that in our experiments was chosen as the classification target. Since each network node (participant) could have multiple interests assigned, it was decided to construct 20 separate experimental data sets that formed a binary assignment of each interest. Example networks are presented in Fig. 4 and 5. For the clarity of the experiment, the binary classification problem was established as it did not contrive a loss of generality of the proposed feature extraction approach."

In particular, standard deviation of accuracy for 20 data sets in first case equals 1% and in the second 12%.\nAdditionally, experiments have revealed that classification based on feature set 4 returns in average worse accuracy than classification based on feature set 3 (see Table 3). Let remind that feature set 4 contains all features from sets 1, 2 and 3. Worse classification performance might be an effect of too many relative poor input features, from which some weaken classification and have contrary discriminative distributions. It refers features from set 1 and 2 that degrade high correlation between output and label-dependent features from set 3. It means that the features extracted from the social network are so good that regular profiles of the tested cases only decrease classification performance and should not be even taken into account.\nOwing to the carried out experiments, it is visible that the proposed labeldependent features used in classification undoubtedly provide the best results."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusions and Future Work",
      "text" : "A new method for label-dependent feature extraction from the social network was proposed in the paper. The main principle behind the method is based the selective definitions of sub-graphs for which new features are defined and computed. These new features provide additional quantitative information about the network context of the case being classified.\nAccording to collected experimental evidences, the proposed label-dependent feature extraction appears to be significantly more effective and improves classification performance in high extent. Obtained, so good, results were even surprising to authors. These results have shown that the new approach to classification extended with features derived from the social network may return very satisfactory and promising outcomes.\nIt may even happen that the regular features only decrease classification indicators and should be removed from the input feature set. This phenomenon comes probably from the general background of both feature sources. Human profiles are, in fact, the voluntarily collected data whereas social networks are created upon real people activities. There is a crucial difference between a statement “I am interested in mountains” and real information about the mountain climbing. The second is more reliable.\nFeature work will focus on further experimentations on the method, especially in terms of its validity for variety of local network measures. Additionally, the proposed feature extraction method will also be examined against the usage of global objective functions for classification. Yet another direction of future studies will be\ndevelopment of new ensemble algorithms, which would have network measures already incorporated, especially based on boosting concept [8].
