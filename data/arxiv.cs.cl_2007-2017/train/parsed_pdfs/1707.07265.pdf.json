      "text" : "Knowledge about entities and their relations (relation instances) are crucial for a wide spectrum of NLP applications, e.g., information retrieval, question answering, and recognizing textual entailment. Learning distributed representations for relation instances is a central technique in downstream applications as a number of recent studies demonstrated the usefulness of distributed representations for words (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014) and sentences (Sutskever et al., 2014; Cho et al., 2014; Kiros et al., 2015).\nIn particular, semantic modeling of relations and their textual realizations (relational patterns hereafter) is extremely important because a rela-\ntion (e.g., causality) can be mentioned by various expressions (e.g., “X cause Y”, “X lead to Y”, “Y is associated with X”). To make matters worse, relational patterns are highly productive: we can produce a emphasized causality pattern “X increase the severe risk of Y” from “X increase the risk of Y” by inserting severe to the pattern.\nTo model the meanings of relational patterns, the previous studies built a co-occurrence matrix between relational patterns (e.g., “X increase the risk of Y”) and entity pairs (e.g., “X: smoking, Y: cancer”) (Lin and Pantel, 2001; Nakashole et al., 2012). Based on the distributional hypothesis (Harris, 1954), we can compute a semantic vector of a relational pattern from the co-occurrence matrix, and measure the similarity of two relational patterns as the cosine similarity of the vectors. Nowadays, several studies adopt distributed representations computed by neural networks for semantic modeling of relational patterns (Yih et al., 2014; Takase et al., 2016).\nNotwithstanding, the previous studies paid little attention to explicitly evaluate semantic modeling of relational patterns. In this paper, we construct a new dataset that contains a pair of relational patterns with five similarity ratings judged by human annotators. The new dataset shows a\nar X\niv :1\n70 7.\n07 26\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 2\n3 Ju\nl 2 01\n7\nhigh inter-annotator agreement, following the annotation guideline of Mitchell and Lapata (2010). The dataset is publicly available on the Web site1.\nIn addition, we conduct a comparative study of different encoders for composing distributed representations of relational patterns. During the comparative study, we present Gated Additive Composition, which is an enhancement of additive composition with the gating mechanism. We utilize the Skip-gram objective for training the parameters of the encoders on a large unlabeled corpus. Experiments show that the new dataset does not only enable detailed analyses of the different encoders, but also provides a gauge to predict successes of distributed representations of relational patterns in another task (relation classification). Figure 1 illustrates the overview of this study."

The dataset includes 5,555 pairs2 extracted by Reverb (Fader et al., 2011), 2,447 pairs with inference relation and 3,108 pairs (the rest) without one.\nInitially, we considered using this high-quality dataset as it is for semantic modeling of relational patterns. However, we found that inference relations exhibit quite different properties from those of semantic similarity. Take a relational pattern pair “X be the part of Y” and “X be an essential part of Y” filled with “X = the small intestine, Y = the digestive system” as an instance. The pattern “X be the part of Y” does not entail “X be an essential part of Y” because the meaning of the former does not include ‘essential’. Nevertheless, both statements are similar, representing the same relation (PART-OF). Another uncomfortable pair is “X fall down Y” and “X go up Y” filled with “X = the dude, Y = the stairs”. The dataset indicates that the former entails the latter probably because falling down from the stairs requires going up there, but they present the opposite meaning. For this reason, we decided to re-annotate semantic similarity\n1http://github.com/takase/relPatSim 2More precisely, the dataset includes 1,012 meaningless pairs in addition to 5,555 pairs.

In instancebased judgment, an annotator judges a pair of relational patterns whose variable slots are filled with the same entity pair. In other words, he or she does not make a judgment for a pair of relational patterns with variables, “X prevent Y” and “X reduce the risk of Y”, but two instantiated statements “Cephalexin prevent the bacteria” and “Cephalexin reduce the risk of the bacteria” (“X = Cephalexin, Y = the bacteria”). We use the entity pairs provided in Zeichner et al. (2012).\nWe asked annotators to make a judgment for a pair of relation instances by choosing a rating from 1 (dissimilar) to 7 (very similar). We provided the following instructions for judgment, which is compatible with Mitchell and Lapata (2010): (1) rate 6 or 7 if the meanings of two statements are the same or mostly the same (e.g., “Palmer team with Jack Nicklaus” and “Palmer join with Jack Nicklaus”); (2) rate 1 or 2 if two statements are dissimilar or unrelated (e.g., “the kids grow up with him” and “the kids forget about him”); (3) rate 3, 4, or 5 if two statements have some relationships (e.g., “Many of you know about the site” and “Many of you get more information about the site”, where the two statements differ but also reasonably resemble to some extent)."

Additionally, we force every pair to have at least five judgments from the workers. Consequently, 60 workers participated in this job. In the final version of this dataset, each pair has five similarity ratings judged by the five most reliable workers who were involved in the pair.\nFigure 2 presents the number of judgments for each similarity rating. Workers seldom rated 7 for a pair of relational patterns, probably because most pairs have at least one difference in content words. The mean of the standard deviations of similarity ratings of all pairs is 1.16. Moreover, we computed Spearman’s ρ between similarity judgments from each worker and the mean of five judgments in the dataset. The mean of Spearman’s ρ of workers involved in the dataset is 0.728.

However, this approach might be affected by data sparseness, which lowers the quality of distributed representations.\nAnother simple but effective approach is additive composition (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010), where the distributed representation of a relational pattern is computed by the mean of embeddings of constituent words. Presuming that a relational pattern consists of a sequence of T words w1, ..., wT , then we let xt ∈ Rd the embedding of the word wt.

Although some researchers reported that GRU is superior to LSTM (Chung et al., 2014), we have no consensus about the superiority. Besides, we are not sure whether LSTM or GRU is really necessary for relational patterns, which ususlly consist of a few words.

Consider the relational pattern “X have access to Y”, whose meaning is mostly identical to that of “X access Y”. Because ‘have’ in the pattern is a light verb, it may be harmful to incorporate the semantic vector of ‘have’ into the distributed representation of the pattern. The same may be true for the functional word ‘to’ in the pattern. However, the additive composition nor RNN does not have a mechanism to ignore the semantic vectors of these words. It is interesting to explore a method somewhere between additive composition and LSTM/GRU: additive composition with the gating mechanism.\nFor this reason, we present an another variant of RNN in this study.

Equation 4 is interpreted as a weighted additive composition between the vector of the current word xt and the vector of the previous hidden state ht−1. The elementwise weights are controlled by the input gate it and forget gate ft; we expect that input gates are closed (close to zero) and forget gates are opened (close to one) when the current word is a control verb or function word.

We define δ words appearing before and after pattern p as the context words, and let Cp = (s − δ, ..., s − 1, s + L, ..., s + L + δ) denote the indices of the context words.

At every occurrence of a relational pattern in the corpus, we use Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and backpropagation through time (BPTT) for training the parameters (matrices) in encoders. More specifically, we initialize the word vectors xt and context vectors x̃t with pre-trained values, and compute gradients for Equation 5 to update the parameters in encoders. In this way, each encoder is trained to compose a vector of a relational pattern so that it can predict the surrounding context words. An advantage of this parameter estimation is that the distributed representations of words and relational patterns stay in the same vector space. Figure 3 visualizes the training process for GAC."

In this approach,\n11http://reverb.cs.washington.edu/ 12http://chainer.org/\nwe allocated a vector hp for each relational pattern p in Equation 5 instead of the vector composition, and trained the vectors of relational patterns using the Skip-gram model. The performance was poor for two reasons: we were unable to compute similarity values for 1,744 pairs because relational patterns in these pairs do not appear in ukWaC; and relational patterns could not obtain sufficient statistics because of data sparseness.\nTable 1 reports Spearman’s rank correlations computed for each pattern length. Here, the length of a relational-pattern pair is defined by the maximum of the lengths of two patterns in the pair. In length of 1, all methods achieve the same correlation score because they use the same word vector xt. The table shows that additive composition (Add) performs well for shorter relational patterns (lengths of 2 and 3) but poorly for longer ones (lengths of 4 and 5+). GAC also exhibits the similar tendency to Add, but it outperforms Add for shorter patterns (lengths of 2 and 3) probably because of the adaptive control of input and forget gates. In contrast, RNN and its variants (RNN, GRU, and LSTM) enjoy the advantage on longer patterns (lengths of 4 and 5+).\nTo examine the roles of input and forget gates of GAC, we visualize the moments when input/forget gates are wide open or closed. More precisely, we extract the input word and scanned words when |it|2 or |ft|2 is small (close to zero) or large (close to one) on the relational-pattern dataset. We restate that we compose a pattern vector in backward order (from the last to the first): GAC scans ‘of’, ‘author’, and ‘be’ in this order for composing the vector of the relational pattern ‘be author of’.\nTable 2 displays the top three examples identified using the procedure. The table shows two groups of tendencies. Input gates open and forget gates close when scanned words are only a preposition and the current word is a content word. In these situations, GAC tries to read the semantic\nvector of the content word and to ignore the semantic vector of the preposition. In contrast, input gates close and forget gates open when the current word is ‘be’ or ‘a’ and scanned words form a noun phrase (e.g., “charter member of”), a complement (e.g., “eligible to participate in”), or a passive voice (e.g., “require(d) to submit”).

(2015) annotated a part of PPDB (Ganitkevitch et al., 2013) to evaluate semantic modeling of paraphrases. Although the target unit of semantic modeling is different from that for these previous studies, we follow the annotation guideline and instruction of Mitchell and Lapata (2010) to build the new dataset.\nThe task addressed in this paper is also related to the Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) task (Agirre et al., 2012). STS is the task to measure the degree of semantic similarity between two sentences. Even though a relational pattern appears as a part of a sentence, it may be difficult to transfer findings from one to another: for example, the encoders of RNN and its variants explored in this study may exhibit different characteristics,\n14In fact, we made substantial efforts to introduce the negative sampling technique. However, Xu et al. (2015) omits the detail of the technique probably because of the severe page limit of short papers. For this reason, we could not reproduce their method in this study.\ninfluenced by the length and complexity of input text expressions.\nIn addition to data construction, this paper addresses semantic modeling of relational patterns. Nakashole et al. (2012) approached the similar task by constructing a taxonomy of relational patterns. They represented a vector of a relational pattern as the distribution of entity pairs co-occurring with the relational pattern. Grycner et al. (2015) extended Nakashole et al. (2012) to generalize dimensions of the vector space (entity pairs) by incorporating hyponymy relation between entities. They also used external resources to recognize the transitivity of pattern pairs and applied transitivities to find patterns in entailment relation. These studies did not consider semantic composition of relational patterns. Thus, they might suffer from the data sparseness problem, as shown by NoComp in Figure 4.\nNumerous studies have been aimed at encoding distributed representations of phrases and sentences from word embeddings by using: Recursive Neural Network (Socher et al., 2011), Matrix Vector Recursive Neural Network (Socher et al., 2012), Recursive Neural Network with different weight matrices corresponding to syntactic categories (Socher et al., 2013) or word types (Takase et al., 2016), RNN (Sutskever et al., 2011), LSTM (Sutskever et al., 2014), GRU (Cho et al., 2014), PAS-CLBLM (Hashimoto et al., 2014), etc. As described in Section 3, we applied RNN, GRU, and LSTM to compute distributed representations of relational patterns because recent papers have demonstrated their superiority in semantic composition (Sutskever et al., 2014; Tang et al., 2015). In this paper, we presented a comparative study of different encoders for semantic modeling of relational patterns.\nTo investigate usefulness of the distributed representations and the new dataset, we adopted the relation classification task (SemEval 2010 Task 8) as a real application. On the SemEval 2010 Task 8, several studies considered semantic composition. Gormley et al. (2015) proposed Feature-rich Compositional Embedding Model (FCM) that can combine binary features (e.g., positional indicators) with word embeddings via outer products. dos Santos et al. (2015) addressed the task using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Xu et al. (2015) achieved a higher performance than dos Santos et al. (2015) by application of CNN on de-\npendency paths. In addition to the relation classification task, we briefly describe other applications. To populate a knowledge base, Riedel et al. (2013) jointly learned latent feature vectors of entities, relational patterns, and relation types in the knowledge base. Toutanova et al. (2015) adapted CNN to capture the compositional structure of a relational pattern during the joint learning. For open domain question answering, Yih et al. (2014) proposed the method to map an interrogative sentence on an entity and a relation type contained in a knowledge base by using CNN.\nAlthough these reports described good performance on the respective tasks, we are unsure of the generality of distributed representations trained for a specific task such as the relation classification. In contrast, this paper demonstrated the contribution of distributed representations trained in a generic manner (with the Skip-gram objective) to the task of relation classification."

In order to address semantic modeling of relational patterns, this paper constructs a new dataset that provides multiple similarity ratings for every pair of relational patterns on the existing dataset (Zeichner et al., 2012). In addition, we conduct a comparative study of different encoders including additive composition, RNN, LSTM, and GRU for composing distributed representations of relational patterns. We also present Gated Additive Composition, which is an enhancement of additive composition with the gating mechanism. Experiments show that the new dataset does not only enable detailed analyses of the different encoders, but also provides a gauge to predict successes of distributed representations of relational patterns in the relation classification task.",
