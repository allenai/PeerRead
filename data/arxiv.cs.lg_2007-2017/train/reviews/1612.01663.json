Previously, oblivious random projection based approaches that project high dimensional features onto a random subspace have been used in practice for tackling high-dimensionality challenge in machine learning. Recently, various non-oblivious randomized reduction methods have been developed and deployed for solving many numerical problems such as matrix product approximation, low-rank matrix approximation, etc. However, they are less explored for the machine learning tasks, e.g., classification. More seriously, the theoretical analysis of excess risk bounds for risk minimization, an important measure of generalization performance, has not been established for non-oblivious randomized reduction methods. It therefore remains an open problem what is the benefit of using them over previous oblivious random projection based approaches. To tackle these challenges, we propose an algorithmic framework for employing non-oblivious randomized reduction method for general empirical risk minimizing in machine learning tasks, where the original high-dimensional features are projected onto a random subspace that is derived from the data with a small matrix approximation error. We then derive the first excess risk bound for the proposed non-oblivious randomized reduction approach without requiring strong assumptions on the training data. The established excess risk bound exhibits that the proposed approach provides much better generalization performance and it also sheds more insights about different randomized reduction approaches. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, whose dimension scales to $O(10^7)$, to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 Dec 2016 04:58:45 GMT  (44kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01663v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yi xu", "haiqin yang", "lijun zhang 0005", "tianbao yang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1612.01663"}
