      "text" : "Dependency parsing has become a key research topic in NLP in the last decade, boosted by the success of the CoNLL 2006 and 2007 shared tasks on multilingual dependency parsing (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007a). McDonald and Nivre (2011) identify two types of data-driven methodologies for dependency parsing: graph-based approaches (Eisner, 1996; McDonald et al., 2005; Koo and Collins, 2010) and transition-based approaches (Yamada and Matsumoto, 2003; Nivre, 2003). Most traditional graph- or transition-based parsing approaches manually define a set of core and combined features associated with one-hot representations (McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Nivre et al., 2007b; Bohnet, 2010; Zhang and Nivre, 2011; Martins et al., 2013; Choi and McCallum, 2013). Recent work shows that using deep learning in dependency parsing has obtained state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) performances. Several authors represent the core features with dense vector embeddings and then feed them as inputs to neural networkbased classifiers (Chen and Manning, 2014; Weiss et al., 2015; Pei et al., 2015; Andor et al., 2016). In addition, others propose novel neural architectures for parsing to handle feature-engineering (Dyer et al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016; Wang and Chang, 2016; Kiperwasser and Goldberg, 2016a,b; Dozat and Manning, 2017; Ma and Hovy, 2017; Peng et al., 2017).\nPart-of-speech (POS) tags are essential features used in most dependency parsers. In real-world parsing, those parsers rely heavily on the use of automatically predicted POS tags, thus encountering error propagation problems. For example, Li et al. (2011), Straka et al. (2016) and Nguyen et al. (2016) show that parsing accuracies drop by 5+% when utilizing automatic POS tags instead of gold ones. Some attempts have been conducted to avoid using POS tags during dependency parsing (Dyer et al., 2015; Ballesteros et al., 2015), however, these approaches still additionally use the automatic POS tags to achieve the best accuracy. Alternatively, joint learning both POS tagging and dependency parsing has gained more attention because: i) more accurate POS tags could lead to improved parsing performance and ii) the the syntactic context of a parse tree could help resolve POS ambiguities (Hatori et al., 2011; Li et al., 2011; Bohnet and Nivre, 2012; Qian and Liu, 2012; Wang and Xue, 2014; Zhang et al., 2015; Alberti et al., 2015; Johannsen et al., 2016; Zhang and Weiss, 2016).\nIn this paper, we propose a novel neural architecture for joint POS tagging and graphbased dependency parsing. Our model learns latent feature representations shared for both POS tagging and dependency parsing tasks by using BiLSTM—the bidirectional LSTM (Schuster\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n05 95\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n6 M\nay 2\n01 7\nand Paliwal, 1997; Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). Not using any external resources such as pre-trained word embeddings, experimental results on 19 languages from the Universal Dependencies project show that: our joint model performs better than SOTA dependency parsers and especially outperforms the neural network-based Stack-propagation model for joint POS tagging and transition-based dependency parsing (Zhang and Weiss, 2016), achieving a new state of the art."

      "heading" : "2 Our joint model",
      "text" : "In this section, we describe our new model for joint POS tagging and dependency parsing, which we call jPTDP. Figure 1 illustrates the architecture of our new model. We learn shared latent feature vectors representing word tokens in an input sentence by using BiLSTMs. Then these shared feature vectors are further used to make the prediction of POS tags as well as fed into a multi-layer perceptron with one hidden layer (MLP) to decode dependency arcs and another MLP to predict relation types for labeling the predicted arcs.\nBiLSTM-based latent feature representations: Given an input sentence s consisting of n word tokens w1, w2, ..., wn, we represent each word wi in s by an embedding e(•)wi . Plank et al. (2016) and Ballesteros et al. (2015) show that character-based representations of words help improve POS tagging and dependency parsing performances. So,\nwe also use a sequence BiLSTM (BiLSTMseq) to compute a character-based vector representation for each word wi in s. For a word type w consisting of k characters w = c1c2...ck, the input to the sequence BiLSTM consists of k character embeddings c1:k in which each embedding vector cj represents the jth character cj in w; and the output is the character-based embedding e(∗)w of the word type w, computed as:\ne(∗)w = BiLSTMseq(c1:k)\nFor the ith word wi in the input sentence s, we create an input vector ei which is a concatenation (◦) of the corresponding word embedding and character-based embedding vectors:\nei = e (•) wi ◦ e (∗) wi\nThen, we feed the sequence of input vectors e1:n with an addition index i corresponding to a context position into another BiLSTM (BiLSTMctx), resulting in shared feature vectors vi representing the ith words wi in the sentence s:\nvi = BiLSTMctx(e1:n, i)\nPOS tagging: Using shared BiLSTM-based feature vectors, then we follow a common approach to compute the cross-entropy objective loss LPOS(t̂, t), in which t̂ and t are the sequence of predicted POS tags and sequence of gold POS tags of words in the input sentence s, respectively (Goldberg, 2016; Plank et al., 2016).\nArc-factored graph-based parsing: Dependency trees can be formalized as directed graphs. An arc-factored parsing approach learns the scores of the arcs in a graph (Kübler et al., 2009). Then, using an efficient decoding algorithm such as Eisner (1996)’s algorithm, we can find a maximum spanning tree—the highest scoring parse tree—of the graph from those arc scores:\nscore(s) = argmax ŷ∈Y(s) ∑ (h,m)∈ŷ scorearc(h,m)\nwhere Y(s) is the set of all possible dependency trees for the input sentence s while scorearc(h,m) measures the score of the arc between the head hth word and the modifier mth word in s. Following Kiperwasser and Goldberg (2016b), we score an arc by using a MLP with one-node output layer (MLParc) on top of the BiLSTMctx:\nscorearc(h,m) = MLParc(vh ◦ vm) where vh and vm are the shared BiLSTM-based feature vectors representing the hth and mth words in s, respectively. We now compute a marginbased hinge loss Larc with loss-augmented inference to maximize the margin between the gold unlabeled parse tree and the highest scoring incorrect tree (Kiperwasser and Goldberg, 2016b).\nDependency relation types are predicted in a similar manner. We use another MLP on top of the BiLSTMctx for predicting relation type of an head-modifier arc. Here, the number of the nodes in the output layer of this MLP (MLPrel) is the number of relation types. Given an arc (h,m), we compute a corresponding output vector as:\nv(h,m) = MLPrel(vh ◦ vm) Then, based on MLP output vectors v(h,m), we also compute another margin-based hinge loss Lrel for relation type prediction, using only the gold labeled parse tree.\nJoint model training: The final training objective function of our joint model is the sum of the POS tagging loss LPOS, the structure loss Larc and the relation labeling loss Lrel. The model parameters, including word embeddings, character embeddings, two BiLSTMs and two MLPs, are learned to minimize the sum of the losses.\nDiscussion: Prior neural network-based joint models for POS tagging and dependency parsing are feed-forward network- and transition-based approaches (Alberti et al., 2015; Zhang and Weiss,\n2016), while our model is BiLSTM- and graphbased method. Our model can be considered as a two-component mixture of a tagging component and a parsing component. Here, the tagging component can be viewed as a simplified version without the additional auxiliary loss for rare words of the BiLSTM-based POS tagging model proposed by Plank et al. (2016). The parsing component can be viewed as an extension of the graph-based dependency model proposed by Kiperwasser and Goldberg (2016b), where we replace the input POS tag embeddings by the character-based representations of words."

(2016), we apply a word dropout rate of 0.25 and Gaussian noise with σ = 0.2. For training, we run for 30 epochs, and evaluate the mixed accuracy of correctly assigning POS tag together with dependency arc and relation type on the development set after each training epoch. We perform a minimal grid search of hyper-parameters on English. We find that the highest mixed accuracy on the English development set is when using 64-dimensional character embeddings, 128-dimensional word embeddings,\n1http://universaldependencies.org/ 2 Zhang and Weiss (2016) and Plank et al.

      "text" : "Table 1 compares the POS tagging and dependency parsing results of our model jPTDP with results reported in prior work, using the same experimental setup.\nRegarding POS tagging, our joint model jPTDP generally obtains similar POS tagging accuracies to the SOTA BiLSTM-aux model (Plank et al., 2016). Our model also achieves higher averaged POS tagging accuracy than the SOTA joint model Stack-propagation (Zhang and Weiss, 2016). Note that there are slightly higher tagging results ob-\n4On English, it took 6 hours for training with these hyperparameters, and then obtaining a speed at 700 words/second, evaluated on a computer with 2.2 GHz Core i7 processor.\ntained by BiLSTM-aux when utilizing pre-trained word embeddings for initialization, as presented in Plank et al. (2016). However, for a fair comparison to both Stack-propagation and our jPTDP, we only compare to the results reported without using the pre-trained word embeddings.\nIn terms of dependency parsing, in most cases, our model jPTDP outperforms Stack-propagation. It is somewhat unexpected that our model produces about 7% absolute lower LAS score than Stack-propagation on Dutch (nl). A possible reason is that the hyper-parameters we selected on English are not optimal for Dutch. Another reason is due to a large number of non-projective trees in Dutch test set (106/386 ≈ 27.5%), while we use the Eisner’s decoding algorithm, producing only projective trees (Eisner, 1996). Without taking “nl” into account, our averaged LAS score over all remaining languages is 1.1% absolute higher than Stack-propagation’s.\nOne reason for our better LAS is probably because jPTDP uses character-based representations of words, while Stack-propagation uses latent feature representations for suffixes and prefixes which might not be as useful as character-based representations for capturing unknown words. The last row in Table 1 shows an absolute LAS improvement of 4.4% on average when comparing our jPTDP with its simplified version of not using character-based representations: specifically, morphologically rich languages get an averaged improvement of 9.3 %, vice versa 2.6% for others. So, our jPDTP is particularly good for morphologically rich languages, with 1.7% higher averaged LAS than Stack-propagation over these languages."
