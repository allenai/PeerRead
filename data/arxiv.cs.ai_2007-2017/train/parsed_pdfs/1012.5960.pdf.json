      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "A qualitative representation provides mechanisms which characterize central essential properties of objects or configurations. A quantitative representation establishes a measure in relation to a unit of measurement which has to be generally available. Qualitative spatial calculi usually deal with elementary objects (e.g., positions, directions, regions) and qualitative relations between them (e.g., ”adjacent”, ”on the left of”, ”included in”).\nThe constant general availability of common measures is now self evident. However, one needs only remember the example of the history of technologies of measurement of length to see that the more local relative measures, which are qualitatively represented, (for example, ”one piece of material is longer than another” versus ”this thing is two meters long”) can be managed by biological/epigenetic cognitive systems much more easily as absolute quantitative representations. Typically, in Qualitative Spatial Reasoning relatively coarse distinctions between configurations are made only. The two main trends in Qualitative Spatial Reasoning are topological reasoning about regions [11, 13, 2] and positional reasoning about point configurations [4, 3, 6, 7, 12].\nApplications exist in which finer qualitative acceptance areas are helpful. The possibility to use finer qualitative distinctions can be viewed as a stepwise transition to quantitative knowledge. The idea of using context dependant direction and distance intervals for the representation of spatial knowledge can be traced back to Clementini, di Felice, and Hernandez [1]. However, only special cases of reasoning were considered in their work. Here, we will propose calculi that make direct use of general purpose constraint propagation.\nIn this paper we introduce a method for extending binary qualitative direction calculi with adjustable granularity like OPRAm[7] or the star calculus [12] with a granular distance concept. This method is similar to the concept of extending points with an internal reference direction to get oriented points which are the basic entities in the OPRAmcalculus [7]. Even if the spatial objects are from a geometrical point of view infinitesimal small points locally available reference measures are attached. In the case of OPRAm, a reference direction is attached. The same principle works also with local reference distances which are called elevations. The principle of attaching references features to a point is called hidden feature attachment.\nThe newly proposed calculi are an extension of the OPRAmcalculus called EOPRAmand an extension of the star calculus. The key principle to derive these new calculi is presented in the next section."

      "text" : "There is a motivation about the use of oriented points in qualitative calculi. This motivation is neccessary since qualitative calculi characterize central essential properties of objects or configurations (see section ??). A simple featureless point naturally would not have an internal reference direction. The conception which makes the internal reference direction plausible is a transition from a calculus which is based on straight line segments (dipoles) [9] with concrete length to line segments with infinitely small length. In this conceptualization the length of the objects no longer has any importance. Thus, only the direction of the objects is modeled. O-points, our term for oriented points, are specified as pair of a point and a direction on the 2D-plane [7].\nThis method attaches a feature which is used as a local reference to an object on the 2D-plane which is geometrically still a featureless point. We call this principle hidden feature attachment. This principle can be extended to other modalities than directions."

      "heading" : "2.1 Qualitative o-point relations",
      "text" : "In a coarse representation a single o-point induces the sectors depicted in Fig. ??. “front,” “back,” “left,” and “right” are linear sectors; “left-front,” “right-front,” “leftback,” and “right-back” are quadrants. The position of the point itself is denoted as “same.” This qualitative granularity corresponds to Freksa’s single and double cross calculi [4, 14].\nIn OPRA2, for the general case where the two points have different positions, we use the following relation symbols (the abbreviations lf , lb, rb, rf stand for “left-front,” “left-back,” “right-back, ” and “right-front,”, respectively):\nfront front, lf front, left front, lb front, back front, rb front, right front, rf front, front lf , lf lf, ... , rf rf.\nHere, a qualitative spatial relative direction relation between two o-points is represented by two pieces of information:\n• the sector (seen from the first o-point) in which the second o-point lies (this determines the lower part of the relation symbol), and\n• the sector (seen from the second o-point) in which the first o-point lies (this determines the upper part of the relation symbol).\nAltogether we obtain 8× 8 base relations for the two points having different positions. Then the configuration shown in Fig. 1 is expressed by the relation A lfrf B. If both points share the same position, the lower relation symbol part is the word “same” and the upper part denotes the direction of the second o-point with respect to the first one, as shown in Fig. 2.\nAltogether we obtain 72 different atomic relations (eight times eight general relations plus eight with the o-points at the same position). These relations are jointly exhaustive and pairwise disjoint (JEPD). The relation frontsame is the identity relation."

      "heading" : "2.2 Elevated o-point relations",
      "text" : "An extension of binary direction calculi with a local reference direction can also be motivated with the following conception. In this conception local basic perceptions of cognitive agent are the basis for the agent’s ability to distinguish relative distances. In this conception the point which represents the location is ”elevated” above the 2D-plane (see Fig 3). From this observer perspective Gibson’s insights about natural perspective [5] motivate the availability of depth clues which let the observer distinguish local distances based on it’s height as reference distance. In the case of the OPRAmcalculus in which the entities are oriented points called o-points, the elevated entities are called elevated o-points, or eo-points.\nThe granularity depicted in Fig. 3 corresponds to a granularity of m = 2 (for the concept of scalable granularity compare [10]). In this granularity we have the following binary distance relations for points which have different locations:\ndistant distant , equal distant , close distant , distant equal , equal equal , close equal , distant close , equal close , close close\nThe distance relations can be combined with the binary relative direction relations of theOPRAmcalculus. The relation depicted in Fig. 3 has then the following symbol:\nA rf distantrf close B\nTo formally specify the eo-point relations we use two-dimensional continuous space, in particular R2. Every eo-point S on the plane is an ordered triple of a point pS represented by its Cartesian coordinates x and y, with x, y ∈ R, and a direction φS , and an internal reference distance δS . The internal reference distance δS is the property which corresponds to the elevation height in the cognitive motivation.\nS = (pS , φS , δS) , pS = ((pS)x, (pS)y)\nThe metrical distance between eo-points A and B is their euclidean distance:\n|A−B| =\n√\n((pA)x − (pB)x) 2 + ((pA)y − (pB)y) 2\nThen the nine base relations of the binary distance relation in configurations with pA 6= pB are defined in the following way:\nδA < |A−B| > δB ⇐⇒ A distant distant B δA < |A−B| = δB ⇐⇒ A equal distant B δA < |A−B| < δB ⇐⇒ A close distant B δA = |A−B| > δB ⇐⇒ A distant equal B\nδA = |A−B| = δB ⇐⇒ A equal equal B\nδA = |A−B| < δB ⇐⇒ A close equal B\nδA > |A−B| > δB ⇐⇒ A distant close B δA > |A−B| = δB ⇐⇒ A equal close B δA > |A−B| < δB ⇐⇒ A close close B\nIn OPRAm we have adjustable granularity with granularity parameterm [10]. Also the distance modality can have an adjustable granularity. The corresponding schema is demonstrated with granularity m = 4 on Fig. 4.\nWe distinguish the relative distances and relative directions of the two eo-points A and B expressed by a calculus EOPRAm according to the following scheme. The distance relation symbols k, l are attached to the corresponding direction relation symbols i, j:\nAm∠ j|l i|k B\nThere is also a schema for relative distances established by eo-point pairs. AB is an eo-point with δA = |A−B|. The composition of relations follows the standard schema. As future work the EOPRAm composition is will be computed with condensed semantics, an enumeration of a small fragment of the domain (this is a broader concept than the one used in [8]). In the case of EOPRAm, a list of qualitative triangles is generated. This is a similar apporach like the approach for OPRAmcomposition described in [7].\nThe star calculus can also be augmented with local distances. Then the same binary distance relations are combined with the absolute direction relations of the star calculus."
