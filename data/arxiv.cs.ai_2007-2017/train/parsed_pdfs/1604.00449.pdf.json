      "text" : "Rapid and automatic 3D object prototyping has become a game-changing innovation in many applications related to e-commerce, visualization, and architecture, to name a few. This trend has been boosted now that 3D printing is a democratized technology and 3D acquisition methods are accurate and efficient [2]. Moreover, the trend is also coupled with the diffusion of large scale repositories of 3D object models such as ShapeNet [1].\nMost of the state-of-the-art methods for 3D object reconstruction, however, are subject to a number of restrictions. Some restrictions are that: i) objects must be observed from a dense number of views; or equivalently, views must have a relatively small baseline. This is an issue when users wish to reconstruct the object from just a handful of views or ideally just one view (see Fig. 1(a)); ii) objects’ appearances (or their reflectance functions) are expected to be Lambertian (i.e. non-reflective) and the albedos are supposed be non-uniform (i.e., rich of non-homogeneous textures).\n? indicates equal contribution.\nar X\niv :1\n60 4.\n00 44\n9v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\nThese restrictions stem from a number of key technical assumptions. One typical assumption is that features can be matched across views [3,4,5,6] as hypothesized by the majority of the methods based on SFM or SLAM [7,8]. It has been demonstrated (for instance see [9]) that if the viewpoints are separated by a large baseline, establishing (traditional) feature correspondences is extremely problematic due to local appearance changes or self-occlusions. Moreover, lack of texture on objects and specular reflections also make the feature matching problem very difficult [10,11].\nIn order to circumvent issues related to large baselines or non-Lambertian surfaces, 3D volumetric reconstruction methods such as space carving [12,13,14,15] and their probabilistic extensions [16] have become popular. These methods, however, assume that the objects are accurately segmented from the background or that the cameras are calibrated, which is not the case in many applications.\nA different philosophy is to assume that prior knowledge about the object appearance and shape is available. The benefit of using priors is that the ensuing reconstruction method is less reliant on finding accurate feature correspondences across views. Thus, shape prior-based methods can work with fewer images and with fewer assumptions on the object reflectance function as shown in [17,18]. The shape priors are typically encoded in the form of simple 3D primitives as demonstrated by early pioneering works [19,20] or learned from rich repositories of 3D CAD models [21,22,23], whereby the concept of fitting 3D models to images of faces was explored to a much larger extent [24,25,26]. Sophisticated mathematical formulations have also been introduced to adapt 3D shape models to observations with different degrees of supervision [27] and different regularization strategies [28].\nThis paper is in the same spirit as the methods discussed above, but with a key difference. Instead of trying to match a suitable 3D shape prior to the observation of the object and possibly adapt to it, we use deep convolutional neural networks to learn a mapping from observations to their underlying 3D shapes of objects from a large collection of training data. Inspired by early works that used machine learning to learn a 2D-to-3D mapping for scene understanding [29,30], data driven approaches have been recently proposed to solve the daunting problem of recovering the shape of an object from just a single image [31,32] for a given number of object categories. In our approach, however, we leverage for the first time the ability of deep neural networks to automatically learn, in a mere end-to-end fashion, the appropriate intermediate representations from data to recover approximated 3D object reconstructions from as few as a single image with minimal supervision.\nInspired by the success of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [33] networks [34,35] as well as recent progress in single-view 3D reconstruction using Convolutional Neural Networks [36,37], we propose a novel architecture that we call the 3D Recurrent Reconstruction Neural Network (3D-R2N2). The network takes in one or more images of an object instance from different viewpoints and outputs a reconstruction of the object in the form of a 3D occupancy grid, as illustrated in Fig. 1(b). Note that in both training and testing, our network does not require\nany object class labels or image annotations (i.e., no segmentations, keypoints, viewpoint labels, or class labels are needed).\nOne of the key attributes of the 3D-R2N2 is that it can selectively update hidden representations by controlling input gates and forget gates. In training, this mechanism allows the network to adaptively and consistently learn a suitable 3D representation of an object as (potentially conflicting) information from different viewpoints becomes available (see Fig. 1).\nThe main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n– We propose an extension of the standard LSTM framework that we call the 3D Recurrent Reconstruction Neural Network which is suitable for accommodating multi-view image feeds in a principled manner. – We unify single- and multi-view 3D reconstruction in a single framework. – Our approach requires minimal supervision in training and testing (just\nbounding boxes, but no segmentation, keypoints, viewpoint labels, camera calibration, or class labels are needed). – Our extensive experimental analysis shows that our reconstruction framework outperforms the state-of-the-art method for single-view reconstruction [32]. – Our network enables the 3D reconstruction of objects in situations when traditional SFM/SLAM methods fail (because of lack of texture or wide baselines).\nAn overview of our reconstruction network is shown in Fig. 1(b). The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we give a brief overview of LSTM and GRU networks. In Section 3, we introduce the 3D Recurrent Reconstruction Neural Network architecture. In Section 4, we discuss how we generate training data and give details of the training process. Finally, we present test results of our approach on various datasets including PASCAL 3D and ShapeNet in Section 5."

      "text" : "In this section we provide a brief overview of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and a variation of the LSTM called Gated Recurrent Units (GRU).\nLong Short-Term Memory Unit. One of the most successful implementations of the hidden states of an RNN is the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) unit [33]. An LSTM unit explicitly controls the flow from input to output, allowing the network to overcome the vanishing gradient problem [33,38]. Specifically, an LSTM unit consists of four components: memory units (a memory cell and a hidden state), and three gates which control the flow of information from the input to the hidden state (input gate), from the hidden state to the output (output gate), and from the previous hidden state to the current hidden state (forget gate). More formally, at time step t when a new input xt is received, the operation of an LSTM unit can be expressed as:\nit = σ(Wixt + Uiht−1 + bi) (1)\nft = σ(Wfxt + Ufht−1 + bf ) (2)\not = σ(Woxt + Uoht−1 + bo) (3)\nst = ft st−1 + it tanh(Wsxt + Usht−1 + bs) (4) ht = ot tanh(st) (5)\nit, ft, ot refer to the input gate, the output gate, and the forget gate, respectively. st and ht refer to the memory cell and the hidden state, respectively. We use to denote element-wise multiplication and the subscript t to refer to an activation at time t. W(·), U(·) are matrices that transform the current input xt and the previous hidden state ht−1, respectively, and b(·) represents the biases.\nGated Recurrent Unit. A variation of the LSTM unit is the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) proposed by Cho et al. [39]. An advantage of the GRU is that there are fewer computations compared to the standard LSTM. In a GRU, an update gate controls both the input and forget gates. Another difference is that a reset gate is applied before the nonlinear transformation. More formally,\nut = σ(WuT xt + Uu ∗ ht−1 + bf ) (6) rt = σ(WiT xt + Ui ∗ ht−1 + bi) (7) ht = (1− ut) ht−1 + ut tanh(Whxt + Uh(rt ht−1) + bh) (8)\nut, rt, ht represent the update gate, the reset gate, and the hidden state respectively. We follow the same notations as LSTM for matrices and biases."

      "heading" : "3 3D Recurrent Reconstruction Neural Network",
      "text" : "In this section, we introduce a novel architecture named the 3D Recurrent Reconstruction Network (3D-R2N2), which builds upon the standard LSTM and GRU. The goal of the network is to perform both single- and multi-view 3D\nreconstructions. The main idea is to leverage the power of LSTM to retain previous observations and incrementally refine the output reconstruction as more observations become available.\nThe network is made up of three components: a 2D Convolutional Neural Network (2D-CNN), a novel architecture named 3D Convolutional LSTM (3DLSTM), and a 3D Deconvolutional Neural Network (3D-DCNN) (see Fig. 2). Given one or more images of an object from arbitrary viewpoints, the 2D-CNN first encodes each input image x into low dimensional features T (x) (Section 3.1). Then, given the encoded input, a set of newly proposed 3D Convolutional LSTM (3D-LSTM) units (Section 3.2) either selectively update their cell states or retain the states by closing the input gate. Finally, the 3D-DCNN decodes the hidden states of the LSTM units and generates a 3D probabilistic voxel reconstruction (Section 3.3).\nThe main advantage of using an LSTM-based network comes from its ability to effectively handle object self-occlusions when multiple views are fed to the network. The network selectively updates the memory cells that correspond to the visible parts of the object. If a subsequent view shows parts that were previously self-occluded and mismatch the prediction, the network would update the LSTM states for the previously occluded sections but retain the states of the other parts (Fig. 2)."

      "text" : "We use CNNs to encode images into features. We designed two different 2D-CNN encoders as shown in Fig. 2: A standard feed-forward CNN and a deep residual variation of it. The first network consists of standard convolution layers, pooling layers, and leaky rectified linear units followed by a fully-connected layer. Motivated by a recent study [40], we also created a deep residual variation of the first network and report the performance of this variation in Section 5.2. According to the study, adding residual connections between standard convolu-\ntion layers effectively improves and speeds up the optimization process for very deep networks. The deep residual variation of the encoder network has identity mapping connections after every 2 convolution layers except for the 4th pair. To match the number of channels after convolutions, we use a 1× 1 convolution for residual connections. The encoder output is then flattened and passed to a fully connected layer which compresses the output into a 1024 dimensional feature vector."

      "heading" : "3.2 Recurrence: 3D Convolutional LSTM",
      "text" : "The core part of our 3D-R2N2 is a recurrence module that allows the network to retain what it has seen and to update the memory when it sees a new image. A naive approach would be to use a vanilla LSTM network. However, predicting such a large output space (32× 32× 32) would be a very difficult task without any regularization. We propose a new architecture that we call 3D-Convolutional LSTM (3D-LSTM). The network is made up of a set of structured LSTM units with restricted connections. The 3D-LSTM units are spatially distributed in a 3D grid structure, with each unit responsible for reconstructing a particular part of the final output (see Fig. 3(a)). Inside the 3D grid, there are N×N×N 3D-LSTM units where N is the spatial resolution of the 3D-LSTM grid. Each 3D-LSTM unit, indexed (i, j, k), has an independent hidden state ht,(i,j,k) ∈ RNh . Following the same notation as in Section 2 but with ft, it, st, ht as 4D tensors (N×N×N vectors of size Nh), the equations governing the 3D-LSTM grid are\nft = σ(WfT (xt) + Uf ∗ ht−1 + bf ) (9) it = σ(WiT (xt) + Ui ∗ ht−1 + bi) (10) st = ft st−1 + it tanh(WsT (xt) + Us ∗ ht−1 + bs) (11) ht = tanh(st) (12)\nWe denote the convolution operation as ∗. In our implementation, we use N = 4. Unlike a standard LSTM, we do not have output gates since we only extract the output at the end. By removing redundant output gates, we can reduce the number of parameters.\nIntuitively, this configuration forces a 3D-LSTM unit to handle the mismatch between a particular region of the predicted reconstruction and the ground truth model such that each unit learns to reconstruct one part of the voxel space instead of contributing to the reconstruction of the entire space. This configuration also endows the network with a sense of locality so that it can selectively update its prediction about the previously occluded part of the object. We visualize such behavior in the appendix.\nMoreover, a 3D Convolutional LSTM unit restricts the connections of its hidden state to its spatial neighbors. For vanilla LSTMs, all elements in the hidden layer ht−1 affect the current hidden state ht, whereas a spatially structured 3D Convolutional LSTM only allows its hidden states ht,(i,j,k) to be affected by its neighboring 3D-LSTM units for all i, j, and k. More specifically, the neighboring connections are defined by the convolution kernel size. For instance, if we use a 3×3×3 kernel, an LSTM unit is only affected by its immediate neighbors. This way, the units can share weights and the network can be further regularized.\nIn Section 2, we also described the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) as a variation of the LSTM unit. We created a variation of the 3D-Convolutional LSTM using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). More formally, a GRU-based recurrence module can be expressed as\nut = σ(WfxT (xt) + Uf ∗ ht−1 + bf ) (13) rt = σ(WixT (xt) + Ui ∗ ht−1 + bi) (14) ht = (1− ut) ht−1 + ut tanh(WhT (xt) + Uh ∗ (rt ht−1) + bh) (15)"

After the last layer where the activation reaches the target output resolution, we convert the final activation V ∈ RNvox×Nvox×Nvox×2 to the occupancy probability p(i,j,k) of the voxel cell at (i, j, k) using voxel-wise softmax."

We first rendered the CAD models with a transparent background and then augmented the input images with random crops from the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset [42]. Also, we tinted the color of the models and randomly translated the images. Note that all viewpoints were sampled randomly. Training: In training the network, we used variable length inputs ranging from one image to an arbitrary number of images. More specifically, the input length (number of views) for each training example within a single mini-batch was kept constant, but the input length of training examples across different mini-batches varied randomly. This enabled the network to perform both single- and multiview reconstruction. During training, we computed the loss only at the end of an input sequence in order to save both computational power and memory. On the other hand, during test time we could access the intermediate reconstructions at each time step by extracting the hidden states of the LSTM units. Network: The input image size was set to 127 × 127. The output voxelized reconstruction was of size 32 × 32 × 32. The networks used in the experiments were trained for 60, 000 iterations with a batch size of 36 except for [Res3D-GRU3] (See Table 1), which needed a batch size of 24 to fit in an NVIDIA Titan X GPU. For the LeakyReLU layers, the slope of the leak was set to 0.1 throughout the network. For deconvolution, we followed the unpooling scheme presented in [41].

We used the [Res3D-GRU-3] network in this experiment. We evaluated the network with the ShapeNet testing set. The testing set consisted of 8725 models in 13 major categories. We rendered five random views for each model, and we applied a uniform colored background to the image. We report both softmax loss and intersection over union(IoU) with a voxelization threshold of 0.4 between the predicted and the ground truth voxel models.\nOverall results. We first investigate the quality of the reconstructed models under different numbers of views. Fig. 5(a) and (b) show that reconstruction quality improves as the number of views increases. The fact that the marginal gain decreases accords with our assumption that each additional view provides less information since two random views are very likely to have partial overlap.\nPer-category results. We also report the reconstruction IoUs on each of the 13 major categories in the testing set in Table 5. We observed that the reconstruction quality improved for every category as the number of views increased, but the quality varied depending on the category. Cabinets, cars, and speakers had the highest reconstruction performance since the objects are bulky-shaped and have less (shape) variance compared to other classes. The network performed worse on the lamp, bench, and table categories. These classes have much higher shape variation than the other classes. For example, a lamp can have a slim arm or a large lampshade which may move around, and chairs and tables have various types of supporting structures.\nQualitative results. Fig. 6(a) shows some sample reconstructions from the ShapeNet testing set. One exemplary instance is the truck shown in row 2. In the initial view, only the front part of the truck is visible. The network took the safest guess that the object is a sedan, which is the most common shape in the car category. Then the network produced a more accurate reconstruction of the truck after seeing more views. All other instances show similar improvements as the network sees more views of the objects.

MVS methods are limited by the accuracy of feature correspondences across different views. Therefore, they tend to fail reconstructing textureless objects or images from sparsely positioned camera viewpoints. In contrast, our method does not require accurate feature correspondences or adjacent camera viewpoints. Dataset: We used high-quality CAD models of 4 different categories and augmented their texture strengths to low, medium and high by manually editing their textures. We then rendered the models from viewpoints with uniformly sampled azimuth angles. Please refer to Fig. 7 for some samples of rendered\nmodels across different viewpoints and texture strengths. For each texture level and number of views configuration, both the MVS method and our network took identical sets of images as inputs.\nExperiment setup. We used a Patch-Match [48]-based off-the-shelf implementation [49] as the MVS method. The MVS method takes images along with their camera positions estimated by Global SFM [50] and outputs the reconstructed model. For our network, we used the [Res3D-GRU-3] network trained with at most 5 views. In order to cope with more views, we fine-tuned our network with samples that have a maximum of 24 views for 5000 iterations using the ShapeNet training set. We quantified the quality of the reconstructions using IoU of the voxels. The network was voxelized with the occupancy probability threshold set to 0.1. The mesh reconstructed from the MVS method was voxelized into a 32× 32× 32 grid for comparison. Results. The results are shown in Fig. 8 (a) and (b). We observed 1) that our model worked with as few as one view, whereas the MVS method failed completely when the number of views was less than 20 (IoU=0), and 2) that our model worked regardless of the objects’ texture level, whereas the MVS method frequently failed to reconstruct objects that had low texture level even when a large number of views were provided. This shows that our method works in situations where MVS methods would perform poorly or completely fail. Note that the reconstruction performance of our method decreased after the number\nof views passed 24. This is because we only fine-tuned our network on samples with a maximum of 24 views.\nWe also discovered some limitations of our method. First, our method could not reconstruct as many details as the MVS method did when given more than 30 different views of the model. Second, our method performed worse in reconstructing objects with high texture levels. This is largely because most models in the ShapeNet training set have low texture level."

Even though our network can take variable length inputs, we demonstrated that it outperforms the method of Kar et al. [32] in single-view reconstruction using real-world images. We further tested the network’s ability to perform multi-view reconstruction on the ShapeNet dataset [1] and the Online Products dataset [46], which showed that the network is able to incrementally improve its reconstructions as it sees more views of an object. Lastly, we analyzed the network’s performance on multi-view reconstruction, finding that our method can produce accurate reconstructions when techniques such as MVS fail. In summary, our network does not require a minimum number of input images in order to produce a plausible reconstruction and is able to overcome past challenges of dealing with images which have insufficient texture or wide baseline viewpoints."

The network learns a mapping from images of objects to their underlying 3D shapes from a large collection of synthetic data [1]. Our network takes in one or more images of an object instance from arbitrary viewpoints and outputs a reconstruction of the object in the form of a 3D occupancy grid. Unlike most of the previous works, our network does not require any image annotations or object class labels for training or testing. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that our reconstruction framework i) outperforms the state-of-theart methods for single view reconstruction, and ii) enables the 3D reconstruction of objects in situations when traditional SFM/SLAM methods fail (because of lack of texture and/or wide baseline).",
