      "text" : "Open-domain question answering remains a challenging and important problem that is largely unsolved. In this paper we focus on single-relation factoid questions, which are one of the most common forms of questions found in search query logs and community question answering websites (Yih et al., 2014), (Fader et al., 2013).\nWe assume that single-relation questions can be answered by querying a knowledge base such as Freebase with a single entity and predicate argument. For instance, the question “When was Barack Obama born?” can be answered by issuing the query:\nλ(x).place of birth(Barack Obama, x)\nAdditional examples of questions in this Domain are “Where is Buckingham Palace located?” and “What is the language of France?”.\nEven in the simpler domain of single-relation question answering, which does not include questions with multiple relations, such as “When were Barack Obama’s children born?”, the mapping from natural language to a structured knowledgebase query remains non-trivial. First, there are many paraphrases of the same question. Second, even in a small knowledge base such as Freebase,\nar X\niv :1\n60 4.\n00 72\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 4\nA pr\n2 01\n6\nthere are millions of unique entities and thousands of predicates that can be used to construct a query, posing additional challenges for learning.\nTo address these challenges, we propose the use of an encoder-decoder framework with attention, which has already been successfully applied to machine translation, speech recognition, and image captioning (Bahdanau et al., 2014), (Amodei et al., 2015), (Xu et al., 2015). An encoder builds a compact representation for a question and can handle the paraphrase issue.\nMoreover, to make our model robust to unseen knowledge base entries and words, we extract high-level embeddings for questions, predicates, and entities purely from their characterlevel representations. During decoding, we use a general interaction function between these embeddings that measures their semantic relevance. The combined use of character-level modeling and a semantic relevance function allows us to successfully produce likelihood scores for entities and predicates that are not present in our vocabulary, a challenging task for standard encoder-decoder frameworks.\nOur novel, character-level encoder-decoder system is compact, requires significantly less data than previous work, and is able to generalize well to unseen entities during test time. In particular, we achieve 66.1% accuracy using Freebase2M and 65.7% accuracy using Freebase5M on the SimpleQuestions dataset, which beat the previous stateof-art of 63.9% by 2.2% and 1.7% respectively, even though we encounter less than 2% of the entities seen during training when testing. Moreover, in contrast to previous work, we only use the training questions provided to teach our model, without the use of any additional data."

      "heading" : "2 Related Work",
      "text" : "Our work builds upon three major threads of research in machine learning: semantic-parsing for open-domain question answering, character-level modeling, and sequence to sequence learning.\nSemantic parsing for open-domain question answering, which translates a question into a structured knowledge-base query, is a key component in question answering with a knowledge base such as Freebase. While early approaches relied on building high-quality lexicons for domain-specific databases such as GeoQuery (Tang and Mooney, 2001), recent work has focused on building se-\nmantic parsing frameworks for general knowledge bases such as Freebase, (Yih et al., 2014), (Bordes et al., 2014), (Bordes et al., 2015), (Berant and Liang, 2014), (Fader et al., 2013).\nSemantic parsing frameworks for large-scale knowledge bases have to be able to successfully generate queries for the millions of entities and thousands of predicates in the KB, many of which are unseen during training. To address this issue, recent work relies on producing high-level embeddings for predicates and entities in a knowledge base based off of their textual descriptions, (Bordes et al., 2014), (Bordes et al., 2015), (Yih et al., 2014), (Yih et al., 2015). A general interaction function can then be used to measure the semantic similarity of the embeddings of knowledge base entries and the question, to produce a final likelihood score that can be used for query generation.\nHowever, these approaches still suffer from a large-scale vocabulary problem because they use word-level embeddings to encode entities and predicates. Consequently, they often rely on significant data augmentation from sources such as Paralex (Fader et al., 2013), which contains 18 million question-paraphrase pairs scraped from WikiAnswers, to have sufficient examples for each word they encounter.\nAs opposed to word-level modeling, characterlevel modeling can be used to handle the largescale vocabulary issue. While character-level modeling has never been applied to factoid question-answering, it has been successfully applied to sentiment analysis, classification, and named entity recognition (Zhang and LeCun, 2015), (Chung et al., 2015), (Klein et al., 2003). Moreover, in (Chung et al., 2015) the authors show that gated-feedback LSTMs on top of on character-level embeddings can capture long-term dependencies in language modeling.\nLastly, encoder-decoder methods can address the paraphrase issue commonly found in questionanswering. First introduced in (Sutskever et al., 2014), in an encoder-decoder network, a source sequence is first encoded into a fixed-length vector which intuitively captures “meaning”, and then decoded into a desired target sequence. This approach has been used successfully in diverse domains such as machine translation, image captioning, and executing programs (Venugopalan et al., 2014), (Bahdanau et al., 2014), (Xu et al., 2015), (Zaremba and Sutskever, 2014).\nIn our work we intend to combine the proposed approaches from these three different areas of machine learning for the task of single-relation question-answering."

      "heading" : "3 Model",
      "text" : "Given a question, the goal of our model is to generate a structured knowledge base query that can be used to retrieve the answer. In other words, our model assigns a conditional probability of predicting the next predicate or entity yt given an input question q and all the previously predicted knowledge base entries y0, · · · , yt−1.\nIt is important to note that since we focus single-relation question answering in this work, our model decodes every question into exactly 2 outputs–the source entity, and the predicate. Consequently, the goal of our model is to generate a single topic entity and a predicate from Freebase, such as (Barack Obama, /people/person/place of birth), which can then be used to retrieve the fact.\nOur end-to-end framework consists of two components. Like (Bordes et al., 2015), we have an approximate entity linking system that prunes the list of possible predicates and entities our model has to evaluate, and a prediction system which determines the most likely (entity, predicate) pair from the filtered list.\nWe use our encoder-decoder network two times in our end-to-end framework, to determine which part of the question to send to our entity-linking system and to assign a likelihood score to each (predicate, entity) tuple.\nWe will first describe how we represent entities and predicates from a structured knowledge-base, followed by our prediction system, and finally our entity-linking system."

      "text" : "In a knowledge such as Freebase, entities are typically annotated with rich information such as descriptions, aliases in different languages, and types. However, to keep the experimental setup consistent with previous work such as (Bordes et al., 2015) and (Yih et al., 2014), we generate highlevel embeddings for each predicate and entity in Freebase using only their English aliases. For instance, to generate an embedding for the Freebase entity /m/02mjmr, we would take the characters of its English alias Barack Obama and feed it\nthrough our system. However, we do incorporate additional information from Freebase such as entity descriptions for our linking system to improve overall precision, like previous work in this area (Ling et al., 2015), (Lin et al., 2012), (Liang et al., 2013)."

We find that the inclusion of an attention mechanism slightly boosts performance over mean pooling, and allows us to see that the softalignments produced by our model are reasonable.\nAt each time step, we feed in a context vector (Figure 1c) and an input into the LSTM (Figure 1g). To produce the context vector, an attention mechanism is used over the question embeddings (Figure 1b).\nLet si−1 be the hidden state of the LSTM at time i− 1, and hj be the jth question character embedding. Then the context vector ci which represents the entire question is recomputed at each step by the alignment model as follows:\nci = Tx∑ j=1 αij ◦ hj ,\nwhere\nαij = exp (eij)∑Tx k=1 exp (eik)\neij =v > a tanh (Wasi−1 + Uahj) ,\naij are the attention vectors (Figure 1b) that are applied over each hidden unit hj in our diagram. To have fine-grained attention over each dimension of each hidden unit, va ∈ Rn×n ′ . In contrast, to va ∈ R1×n ′\nfor coarse-grained attention. For fine-grained attention with dropout k, each va ∈ Rn×n ′ has a probability k of being zero. Wa ∈ Rn ′×n and Ua ∈ Rn\n′×n are weight matrices. Lastly, for mean-pooling our attention coefficient becomes va = ~1.\nIn addition to the context vector, we also feed in an input into our LSTM at each time step (Figure 1g). As illustrated in Figure 1, at time t = 1 we feed a special input x∗ into our attention LSTM. We experiment with x∗ as both a learnable parameter and as a constant ~0. At time t = 2 we feed the\ninput ycorr during training and ypred during testing, where ycorr is the high-level embedding of the correct predicate, and ypred is the embedding of the predicted predicate at the previous time step. The embeddings, y, z are the outputs of a convolutional neural network, as illustrated in Figure 2."

A similar optimization objective was used to train the semantic similarity modules proposed in (Yih et al., 2014) and (Yih et al., 2015). During prediction time yi and zi are all of the entities and predicates returned by our entity-linking system, while during train time, they are randomly-sampled entities and predicates from the training set.\nFor our loss function we use a cross-entropy criterion, and we use back-propagation to propagate the errors back to all of the weights in our model."

For the Freebase5M and Freebase2M subsets we store all entity English names and descriptions in a full-text search system and retrieve a subset of triples whose topic entity’s English name or description matches a query. The triples are ordered according to tf-idf scores.\nTo generate our queries for the Freebase5M/2M subsets we only feed in a single question ngram into our entity-linking system. Specifically, we take all ngrams e3..6 of length 3-6 of the question, a dummy predicate p = “foo”, the raw question, q, and feed them through our prediction system f(q, e3..6, p). We then take the ngram which our model model predicts is the most likely an entity, e∗ = argmaxe∈e3..6p(e, p|q), and use that as our query. Table 1 contains instances of generated queries."

This demonstrates the difficulty word-embedding models have generalizing to unseen entities, as many entities are represented by words that may be rarely seen during training.\nIn contrast, character-level models have no such issues, and achieve a 96.25% accuracy in predicting the correct entity during negative sampling experiments.

We postulate this is because fine-grained attention is harder to optimize, in spite of the fact that it gives an LSTM more control over what parts of the question to attend to.\nWe also visualize our attention over question characters for coarse-grained attention models. As illustrated in Table 4, we find that coarse-grained attention is able to learn where the predicates and entities are in a question. Attention typically peaks on the space after a sequence of words that correspond to a predicate or entity in a knowledge base. This demonstrates that a character-level LSTM has been able to infer that “space” is a special character that separates words, and is able to learn meaningful representations on the word level, even though it reads in questions character by character."
