      "text" : "Spoken language understanding (SLU) system is a critical component in spoken dialogue systems. SLU system typically involves identifying speaker’s intent and extracting semantic constituents from the natural language query, two tasks that are often referred to as intent detection and slot filling.\nIntent detection and slot filling are usually processed separately. Intent detection can be treated as a semantic utterance classification problem, and popular classifiers like support vector machines (SVMs) [1] and deep neural network methods [2] can be applied. Slot filling can be treated as a sequence labeling task. Popular approaches to solving sequence labeling problems include maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) [3], conditional random fields (CRFs) [4], and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [5, 6, 7]. Joint model for intent detection and slot filling has also been proposed in literature [8, 9]. Such joint model simplifies the SLU system, as only one model needs to be trained and fine-tuned for the two tasks.\nRecently, encoder-decoder neural network models have been successfully applied in many sequence learning problems such as machine translation [10] and speech recognition [11]. The main idea behind the encoder-decoder model is to encode input sequence into a dense vector, and then use this vector to generate corresponding output sequence. The attention mechanism introduced in [12] enables the encoder-decoder architecture to learn to align and decode simultaneously.\nIn this work, we investigate how an SLU model can benefit from the strong modeling capacity of the sequence models. Attention-based encoder-decoder model is capable of mapping sequences that are of different lengths when no alignment information is given. In slot filling, however, alignment is explicit, and thus alignment-based RNN models typically work well. We would like to investigate the combination of the attention-based and alignment-based methods. Specifically, we want to explore how the alignment information in slot filling can be best utilized in the encoder-decoder models, and on the other hand, whether the alignment-based RNN slot filling models can be further improved with the attention mechanism that introduced from the encoder-decoder architecture. Moreover, we want to investigate how slot filling and intent detection can be jointly modeled under such schemes.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we introduce the background on using RNN for slot filling and using encoder-decoder models for sequence learning. In section 3, we describe two approaches for jointly modeling intent and slot filling. Section 4 discusses the experiment setup and results on ATIS benchmarking task. Section 5 concludes the work."

In slot filling, the input sequence and label sequence are of the same length, and thus there is explicit alignment.\nRNNs have been widely used in many sequence modeling problems [6, 13]. At each time step of slot filling, RNN reads a word as input and predicts its corresponding slot label considering all available information from the input and the emitted output sequences. The model is trained to find the best parameter set θ that maximizes the likelihood:\nargmax θ T∏ t=1 P (yt|yt−11 ,x; θ) (1)\nar X\niv :1\n60 9.\n01 45\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 6\nS ep\n2 01\n6\nwhere x represents the input word sequence, yt−11 represents the output label sequence prior to time step t.

The encoder reads a sequence of input (x1, ..., xT ) to a vector c. This vector encodes information of the whole source sequence, and is used in decoder to generate the target output sequence. The decoder defines the probability of the output sequence as:\nP (y) = T∏ t=1 P (yt|yt−11 , c) (3)\nwhere yt−11 represents the predicted output sequence prior to time step t. Comparing to an RNN model for sequence labeling, the RNN encoder-decoder model is capable of mapping sequence to sequence with different lengths. There is no explicit alignment between source and target sequences. The attention mechanism later introduced in [12] enables the encoder-decoder model to learn a soft alignment and to decode at the same time."

      "text" : "The encoder-decoder model for joint intent detection and slot filling is illustrated in Figure 2. On encoder side, we use a bidirectional RNN. Bidirectional RNN has been successfully applied in speech recognition [15] and spoken language understanding [6]. We use LSTM [16] as the basic recurrent network unit for its ability to better model long-term dependencies comparing to simple RNN.\nIn slot filling, we want to map a word sequence x = (x1, ..., xT ) to its corresponding slot label sequence y = (y1, ..., yT ). The bidirectional RNN encoder reads the source word sequence forward and backward. The forward RNN reads the word sequence in its original order and generates a hidden state fhi at each time step. Similarly, the backward RNN reads the word sequence in its reverse order and generate a sequence of hidden states (bhT , ..., bh1). The final encoder hidden state hi at each time step i is a concatenation of the forward state fhi and backward state bhi, i.e. hi = [fhi, bhi].\nThe last state of the forward and backward encoder RNN carries information of the entire source sequence. We use the last state of the backward encoder RNN to compute the initial decoder hidden state following the approach in [12]. The decoder is a unidirectional RNN. Again, we use an LSTM cell as the basic RNN unit. At each decoding step i, the decoder state si is calculated as a function of the previous decoder state si−1, the previous emitted label yi−1, the aligned encoder hidden state hi, and the context vector ci:\nsi = f(si−1, yi−1, hi, ci) (4)\nwhere the context vector ci is computed as a weighted sum of the encoder states h = (h1, ..., hT ) [12]:\nci = T∑ j=1 αi,jhj (5)\nand\nαi,j = exp(ei,j)∑T k=1 exp(ei,k)\nei,k = g(si−1, hk)\n(6)\ng a feed-forward neural network. At each decoding step, the explicit aligned input is the encoder state hi. The context vector ci provides additional information to the decoder and can be seen as a continuous bag of weighted features (h1, ..., hT ).\nFor joint modeling of intent detection and slot filling, we add an additional decoder for intent detection (or intent classification) task that shares the same encoder with slot filling decoder. During model training, costs from both decoders are back-propagated to the encoder. The intent decoder generates only one single output which is the intent class distribution of the sentence, and thus alignment is not required. The intent decoder state is a function of the shared initial decoder state s0, which encodes information of the entire source sequence, and the context vector cintent, which indicates part of the source sequence that the intent decoder pays attention to."

      "heading" : "3.2. Attention-Based RNN Model",
      "text" : "The attention-based RNN model for joint intent detection and slot filling is illustrated in Figure 3. The idea of introducing attention to the alignment-based RNN sequence labeling model\nis motivated by the use of attention mechanism in encoderdecoder models. In bidirectional RNN for sequence labeling, the hidden state at each time step carries information of the whole sequence, but information may gradually lose along the forward and backward propagation. Thus, when making slot label prediction, instead of only utilizing the aligned hidden state hi at each step, we would like to see whether the use of context vector ci gives us any additional supporting information, especially those require longer term dependencies that is not being fully captured by the hidden state.\nIn the proposed model, a bidirectional RNN (BiRNN) reads the source sequence in both forward and backward directions. We use LSTM cell for the basic RNN unit. Slot label dependencies are modeled in the forward RNN. Similar to the encoder module in the above described encoder-decoder architecture, the hidden state hi at each step is a concatenation of the forward state fhi and backward state bhi, hi = [fhi, bhi]. Each hidden state hi contains information of the whole input word sequence, with strong focus on the parts surrounding the word at step i. This hidden state hi is then combined with the context vector ci to produce the label distribution, where the context vector ci is calculated as a weighted average of the RNN hidden states h = (h1, ..., hT ).\nFor joint modeling of intent detection and slot filling, we reuse the pre-computed hidden states h of the bidirectional RNN to produce intent class distribution. If attention is not used, we apply mean-pooling [17] over time on the hidden states h followed by logistic regression to perform the intent classification. If attention is enabled, we instead take the weighted average of the hidden states h over time.\nComparing to the attention-based encoder-decoder model that utilizes explicit aligned inputs, the attention-based RNN model is more computational efficient. During model training, the encoder-decoder slot filling model reads through the input sequence twice, while the attention-based RNN model reads through the input sequence only once."

We evaluate the system performance on slot filling using F1 score, and the performance on intent detection using classification error rate.\nWe obtained another ATIS text corpus that was used in [9] and [20] for SLU evaluation. This corpus contains 5138 utterances with both intent and slot labels annotated. In total there are 110 different slot labels and 21 intent types.

Not to our surprise, the pure attention-based slot filling model that does not utilize explicit alignment information performs poorly. Letting the model to learn the alignment from training data does not seem to be appropriate for slot filling task. Line 2 and line 3 show the F1 scores of the non-attention and attention-based encode-decoder models that utilize the aligned inputs. The\n1We thank Gokhan Tur and Puyang Xu for sharing the ATIS data set.\nattention-based model gives slightly better F1 score than the non-attention-based one, on both the average and best scores. By investigating the attention learned by the model, we find that the attention weights are more likely to be evenly distributed across words in the source sequence. There are a few cases where we observe insightful attention (Figure 4) that the decoder pays to the input sequence, and that might partly explain the observed performance gain when attention is enabled.\nThe second set of results in Table 1 are for bidirectional RNN models described in section 3.2. Similar to the previous set of results, we observe slightly improved F1 score on the model that uses attentions. The contribution from the context vector for slot filling is not very obvious. It seems that for sequence length at such level (average sentence length is 11 for this ATIS corpus), the hidden state hi that produced by the bidirectional RNN is capable of encoding most of the information that is needed to make the slot label prediction.\nTable 2 compares our slot filling models to previous approaches.

In this work, we propose an attention-based neural network model for joint intent detection and slot filling, both of which are critical steps for many speech understanding and dialog systems. Unlike in machine translation and speech recognition, alignment is explicit in slot filling. We explore different strategies in incorporating this alignment information to the encoder-decoder framework. Learning from the attention mechanism in encoder-decoder model, we further propose introducing attention to the alignment-based RNN models. Such attentions provide additional information to the intent classification and slot label prediction. Our independent task models achieve state-of-the-art intent detection error rate and slot filling F1 score on the benchmark ATIS task. Our joint training model further obtains 0.56% absolute (23.8% relative) error reduction on intent detection and 0.23% absolute gain on slot filling over the independent task models.",
