      "text" : "The objective of language modeling is to build a probability distribution over sequences of words. The traditional approaches, inspired by Shannon’s game, has molded this problem into merely predicting the next word given the context. This leads to a linear chain model on words. In its simplest formulation, these conditional probabilities are estimated using frequency tables of word wi following the sequence w1i−1. There are two big issues with this formulation. First, the number of parameters rises exponentially with the size of the context. Second, it is impossible to see all such combinations in the training set, however large it may be. In traditional models, the first problem, famously called the curse of dimensionality, is tack-\nled by limiting the history to the previous n − 1 words leading to an n-gram model. The second problem, one of sparsity, is tackled by redistributing the probability mass over seen and unseen examples usually by applying some kind of smoothing or interpolation techniques. A good overview of various smoothing techniques and their relative performance on language modeling tasks can be found in (Goodman, 2001).\nSmoothened n-gram language models fail on two counts: their inability to generalize and their failure to capture the longer context dependencies. The first one is due to the discrete nature of the problem and the lack of any kind of implicit measure of relatedness or context based clustering among words and phrases. The second problem—the failure to capture longer context dependencies—is due to the n-order Markov restriction applied to deal with the curse of dimensionality. There have been numerous attempts to address both the issues in the traditional ngram framework. Class based models (Brown et al., 1992; Baker and McCallum, 1998; Pereira et al., 1993) try to solve the generalization issue by deterministically or probabilistically mapping words to one or multiple classes based on manually designed or probabilistic criteria. The issue of longer context dependencies has been addressed using various approximations such as cache models (Kuhn and De Mori, 1990), trigger models (Lau et al., 1993) and structured language models (Charniak, 2001; Chelba et al., 1997; Chelba and Jelinek, 2000).\nNeural network based language models take an entirely different approach to solving the generalization problem. Instead of trying to solve the difficult task of modeling the probability distribution over discrete sets of words, they try to embed these words into a continuous space and then build a smooth probability distribution over it. Feedfor-\nar X\niv :1\n60 4.\n00 10\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\nA pr\n2 01\n6\nward neural network based models (Bengio et al., 2006; Mnih and Hinton, 2009; Morin and Bengio, 2005) embed the concatenated n-gram history in this latent space and then use a softmax layer over these embeddings to predict the next word. This solves the generalization issue by building a smoothly varying probability distribution but is still unable to capture longer dependencies beyond the Markovian boundary. Recurrent neural network based models (Mikolov et al., 2011a; Mikolov et al., 2010) attempt to address this by recursively embedding history in the latent space, predicting the next word based on it and then updating the history with the word. Theoretically, this means that the entire history can now be used to predict the next word, hence, the network has the ability to capture longer context dependencies.\nAll the models discussed above solve the two aforementioned issues to varying degrees of success but none of them actually challenge the underlying linear chain model assumption. Language is recursive in nature, and this along with the underlying compositional structure should play an important role in modeling language. The computational linguistics community has been working for years on formalizing the underlying structure of language in the form of grammars. A step in the right direction would be to look beyond simple frequency estimation-based methods and to use these compositional frameworks to assign probability to words and sentences.\nWe start by looking at n-gram models and show how they have an implicit sequential tree assumption. This brings us to the following questions: Is a sequential tree the best compositional structure to model language? If not, then, what is the best compositional structure? Further, do we even need to find one such structure, or can we marginalize over all structures to remove any underlying structural assumptions?\nIn this paper we take the latter approach. We model the probability of a sentence as the marginalized joint probability of words and composition trees (over all possible rooted trees). We use a probabilistic context free grammar (PCFG) to generate these trees and build a probability distribution on them. As generalization is still an issue, we use distributed representations of words and phrases and build a probability distribution on them in the latent space. A similar approach but in a different setting has been attempted in (Socher et\nal., 2013) for language parsing. The major difference between our approach and theirs is the way we handle the breaking of PCFG’s independence assumption due to the distributed representation. Instead of approximating the marginalization using the n-best trees as in (Socher et al., 2013), we restore this independence assumption by averaging over phrasal representations leading to a single phrase representation. This single representation for phrases in turn allows us to use an efficient Inside-Outside (Lari and Young, 1990) algorithm for exact marginalization and training."

A linear chain model would factorize the probability of this sentence p(wn1 ) as a product of conditional probabilities p(wi|hi) leading to the following factorization:\np(wn1 ) = n∏ i=1 p(wi|hi). (1)\nAll the models discussed in previous section differ in how the history or context hi is represented. For a linear chain model with no assumptions, the history hi would be the previous i − 1 words, so the factorization is\np(wn1 ) = n∏ i=1 p(wi|wi−11 ).

Using this definition, we can rewrite p(W ) in terms of the inside probability as\np(W ) = π(S,wn1 ).

In the next section we carefully examine this problem. The approach we follow here is similar to the one taken in (Socher et al., 2010). We embed the words in a vocabulary V in a latent space of dimension d, use a compositional function f to build phrases in this latent space and then build a probability distribution function p over the leaf nodes and compositional rules."

The Outside term β(A,w j i ) is just the opposite. β(A,wji ) is the probability of expanding S to sentence wni such that sub-sequence wji rooted at A is left unexpanded. Similar to the inside probability, the outside probability can be calculated recursively as follows:\nBase Case: As the complete sentence is always rooted at S, β(S,wn1 ) is always 1. Moreover, as no other non-terminal A can be the root of the parse tree, β(A,wn1 ), A 6= S is zero.\n2Henceforth we drop the term αold in all our equations for the sake of brevity.\nRecursive Definition: To compute β(A,wji ) we need to sum up the probabilities both to the left and right of wji . Let’s consider summing over the left side span wi−11 . Figure 3 shows one of the intermediate steps. Let β(rL) be the probability of expanding subsequence wi−1k rooted at B using rule rL = B,w j k → C A,w i−1 k w j i such that w j i rooted at A is left unexpanded. We can write β(rL) in terms of its parent’s outside probability β(B,wjk), left sibling’s inside probability π(C,wi−1k ) and ζrL as\nβ(rL) = ζrLπ(C,w i−1 k )β(B,w j k).

This is an important assumption because the states in the Inside and Outside algorithms are these spans. A\ndistributed representation breaks this assumption. To understand this, let’s consider a three word sentence w31. Figure 4 shows possible derivations of this sentence. Embeddings for p{1{23}} and p{{12}3} are different as they follow different compositional paths despite both representing the same phrase w31. Generalizing this, any sentence or phrase of length 3 or greater would suffer from the multiple representation problem due to multiple possible compositional pathways.\nTo understand why this is an issue, let’s examine the Inside algorithm recursion. Dynamic programming works while calculating π(A,wji ) because we assume that there is only one possible value for each of π(B,wki ) and π(C,w j k+1). As our compositional probability p(r) depends upon the phrase embeddings, so multiple possible phrase representations would mean multiple values for ζr leading to multiple inside probabilities for each span. This can also be seen as breakage of the independence assumption of CFGs, as now, the probability of the parent node also depends upon how it’s children were composed.\nWe restore the assumption by taking the expected value of phrasal embeddings w.r.t. its compositional inside probability π(wji → wki w j k+1) 3\nX(i, j) = Eπ[X(i, k, j)].

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion",
      "text" : "In this paper we challenged the linear chain assumption of the traditional language models by building a model that uses the compositional structure endowed by context free grammars. We formulated it as a marginalization problem over the joint probability of sentences and structure and reduced it to one of modeling compositional rule probabilities p(r). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model that looks beyond the linear chain assumption and uses the compositional structure to model the language. It is important to note that this compositional framework is much more general and the way this paper models p(r) is only one of many possible ways to do so.\nAlso, this paper proposed a compositional framework that recursively embeds phrases in a latent space and then builds a distribution over it. This provides us with a distributional language representation framework which, if trained properly, can be used as a base for various language processing tasks like NER, POS tagging and sentiment analysis. The assumption here is that most of the heavy lifting will be done by the representation and a simple classifier should be able to give good results over the benchmarks. We also hypothesize that phrasal embeddings generated using this model will be much more robust and will also exhibit interesting regularities due to the marginalization over all possible structures.\nAs the likelihood optimization proposed here is highly non linear, better initialization, and improved optimization and regularization techniques being developed for deep architectures can further improve these results. Another area of research is to study the effects of the choice of compositional functions and additional constraints on representation generated by the model and finally the performance of the classification layer built on top."

This is a very strong assumption when modeling something inherently complex such as language. In this paper, we challenge this by showing how the linear chain assumption inherent in previous work can be translated into a sequential composition tree. We then propose a new model that marginalizes over all possible composition trees thereby removing any underlying structural assumptions. As the partition function of this new model is intractable, we use a recently proposed sentence level evaluation metric Contrastive Entropy to evaluate our model. Given this new evaluation metric, we report more than 100% improvement across distortion levels over current state of the art recurrent neural network based language models.",
