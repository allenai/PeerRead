      "text" : "Natural Language Processing (NLP) aims at developing techniques for processing natural language texts using computers. In order to yield accurate results, NLP requires resources containing various information (sub-categorization frames, semantic roles, selection restrictions, etc.). Unfortunately, such resources are not available for most languages and are very costly to develop manually. A recent trend of research has tried to overcome these limitations through the development of automatic acquisition methods from corpora.\nAutomatic lexical acquisition is an engineering task aiming at providing comprehensive—even if not fully accurate—resources for NLP. As natural languages are complex, lexical acquisition needs to take into account a wide range of parameters and constraints. However, surprisingly, in the acquisition community, relatively few investigations have been done on the structure of the linguistic constraints themselves, beyond the engineering point of view (but note that this work has been extensively done for parsing, see [1]).\nIn this paper, we want to take another look at some experiments recently done on the automatic acquisition of lexical resources from textual corpora, more specifically on French. In a way, acquisition is converse to parsing: the task consists, from a surface form, in trying to find an abstract lexical-conceptual structure that justify the surface construction (taking into account the relevant set of constraints for the given language).\n⋆ This work has received support of TransferS (laboratoire d?excellence, program “Investissements d’avenir” ANR-10-IDEX-0001-02 PSL* and ANR-10-LABX-0099)\nHere, in order to get a tractable model, we limit ourselves to the acquisition of subcategorization frames from corpora. The task is challenging since surface forms incorporate adverbs, modifiers, interpolated clauses and some flexibility in the ordering of the arguments.\nMost approaches, including ours, are based on simple filtering techniques. If a complement appears very rarely associated with a given predicate, the acquisition process will assume that this is an incidental co-occurrence that should be left out. However, as we will see, even if this technique is efficient for high frequency items, it leaves a lot of phenomena aside.\nFollowing these observations, we get interested in Optimality Theory (OT). OT is based on a number of assumptions which are absolutely relevant for the lexical acquisition context [2,3,4]:\n– Linguistic well-formedness is relative, not absolute. Perfect satisfaction of all linguistic constraints is attained rarely, and perhaps never. – Linguistic well-formedness is a matter of comparison or competition among candidate output forms (none of which is perfect). – Linguistic constraints are ranked and violable. Higher ranking constraints can compel violation of lower ranking constraints. Violation is minimal, however. And even low ranking constraints can make crucial decisions about the winning output candidate. – The grammar of a language is a ranking of constraints. Ranking may differ from language to language, even if the constraints do not.\nHowever, despite these observations, OT has been mainly applied to phonology, more rarely to morphology or syntax [5,1]. In this paper, we would like to show, on a precise example, that OT provides a very competitive framework for sub-categorization acquisition.\nIn order to apply OT to lexical acquisition, we first need to model all the language properties as constraints. The task consists then in identifying the relevant set of constraints that allow one to map a lexical structure to actual (surface) constructions. Note that the task is highly challenging since constraints interact with each other, must be ranked and can be violated."

      "heading" : "2.1 OT and Syntax",
      "text" : "OT has been mainly applied to syntax in the framework of the Principles and Parameters (P&P) theory developed by Chomsky [6] as part of his Minimalist Program. The central idea of P&P is that a person’s syntactic knowledge can be modeled with two formal mechanisms:\n– A finite set of fundamental principles that are common to all languages; e.g., a sentence must always have a subject, even if it is not overtly pronounced. – A finite set of parameters that determine syntactic variability amongst languages; e.g., a binary parameter that determines whether or not the subject of a sentence must be overtly pronounced.\nWithin this framework, the goal of linguistics is to identify all the principles and parameters that are universal to human languages (i.e. what defines the Universal Grammar).\nOT provides a nice framework to implement P&P since the formalism is constraintbased. The input is a set of (universal) abstract candidate forms1. Thus, principles and parameters just have to be translated into constraints (CON); then an evaluation function (EVAL) computes the best output given the input and the set of constraints (the principles and parameters) for a given language.\nTo summarize, here are the three main components of OT: GEN (+input), CON and EVAL.\n– GEN takes a series of surface forms and generates an infinite number of candidates, or possible realizations of that input. A language’s grammar (its ranking of constraints) determines which of the infinite candidates will be assessed as optimal by EVAL. – CON includes the set of constraints to be used to determine which of the input candidates is the most likely to be accepted. – EVAL determines the best analysis among input candidates, taking into account the set of constraints CON. Given two candidates, A and B, A is better than B on a constraint hierarchy if A incurs fewer violations than B. Candidate A is better than B on an entire constraint hierarchy if A incurs fewer violations of the highestranked constraint distinguishing A and B. A is optimal in its candidate set if it is better on the constraint hierarchy than all other candidates.\nHowever, the task here is slightly different (converse) since we try to find the best underlying representation from the output (a given utterance), more precisely, we try to learn syntactic frames from data."

      "heading" : "2.2 Learning Syntactic Frames from Raw Data",
      "text" : "As already said, comprehensive and accurate lexical resources are key components of Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems. Hand-crafting lexical resources is difficult and extremely labour-intensive— particularly as NLP systems require statistical information about the behavior of lexical items in context, and this statistical information changes from one domain to the other. For this reason automatic acquisition of lexical resources from corpora has become increasingly popular.\nOne of the most useful lexical information for NLP is that related to the predicateargument structure. The sub-categorization frames (SCFs) of a predicate capture the different combinations of arguments that a given predicate can take. For example, in French, the verb “acheter” (to buy) sub-categorizes for a subject, a direct object and an indirect object (a prepositional phrase governed by the preposition “à”). This can be formalized as follows: N0 acheter N1 à N2.\n1 This point, which is much controversial, is based on the assumption that linguistic principles— in P&P Theory—are supposed to be universal. There is a huge literature on this hypothesis that we will not address in this paper. We do not claim any universal feature in this work; we just use OT as an interesting framework for modeling the constraints used.\nSub-categorization lexicons can benefit many NLP applications. For example, they can be used to enhance tasks such as parsing [7,8] and semantic classification [9] as well as applications such as information extraction [10] and machine translation. They also make it possible to infer large multilingual semantic classifications [11].\nSeveral sub-categorization lexicons are available for many languages, but most of them have been built manually. For French these include the large French dictionary “Le Lexique Grammaire” [12] and the more recent Lefff [13] and Dicovalence (http://bach.arts.kuleuven.be/dicovalence/) lexicons.\nSome work has been conducted on automatic sub-categorization acquisition, mostly on English [14,15,16,17] but also on other languages, from which German is just one example [18]. This work has shown that although automatically built lexicons are not as accurate and detailed as manually built ones, they can be useful for real-world tasks. This is mostly because they provide what manually built resources do not generally provide: statistical information about the likelihood of SCFs for individual verbs.\nIn what follows, we show that statistical information, in order to yield accurate results, must take into consideration a huge number of constraints. First experiments have given interesting results but the nature and the structure of constraints must be further explored in order to strengthen the existing results. We show that OT provides an interesting framework to identify and structure the set of relevant constraints."

      "heading" : "2.3 Introducing Gradience in Lexical Acquisition",
      "text" : "As for most linguistic questions, there is no well-established definition of what to include in a SCF, but everybody agrees that a SCF should minimally include the number and the type of the complements depending on the verb (or more generally on the predicative item considered, since adjectives and nouns can also have a SCF). Most authors agree on the fact that complements should be divided between arguments and adjuncts but the distinction between these two categories is far from obvious. Some linguistic tests exist (can the complement be deleted without changing the meaning of the sentence? Can it be moved easily? Can it be pronominalized? etc.) but none of these tests is sufficient or discriminatory enough.\nAs outlined by Manning [19] “rather than maintaining a categorical argument / adjunct distinction and having to make in/out decisions about such cases, we might instead try to represent SCF information as a probability distribution over argument frames, with different verbal dependents expected to occur with a verb with a certain probability”. For example, from the analysis of a large news corpus, one can observe that the French verb venir (to come) accepts the frame PP[de (from)] with a relative frequency of 59.1% whereas it accepts the frame PP[à (to)] with a relative frequency of 5%. This phenomenon can be seen as a kind of selectional “preference” of certain verbs for certain SCFs; the link with more semantic information remains to be done.\nIt is well known that the evaluation of probability distributions is difficult, since it is by definition dependent on a given corpus. Hand-crafted dictionaries generally do not include any frequency information. Moreover, very few lexical acquisition frameworks currently integrate an efficient way to deal with various phenomena such as multiword expressions (especially light verb constructions and semi-idiomatic expressions), complement optionality, etc. Therefore, current approaches have a tendency to produce two\nmany SCFs for a given items (semi-idiomatic expressions should be recognized as such and should not be added as new SCFs associated with head verbs, optionality should be handled to reduce the number of partial SCFs).\nIn the next section, we briefly present a state-of-the art system for French and its limitations; we show that the acquisition model corresponds to OT but does not take into consideration a precise enough set of constraints. We then make some proposals in order to get better results using a finer grain model of constraints."

      "text" : "A system for the automatic acquisition of sub-categorization frames has recently been implemented for French. This system called ASSCI is capable of acquiring large scale lexicons from un-annotated corpora [20,21].\nThis system is close to other systems developed for example for English [16,22] in that it extracts SCFs from data parsed using a shallow dependency parser [23] and is capable of identifying a large number of SCFs. However, unlike most other systems that accept raw corpus data as input, it does not assume a list of predefined SCFs. The system is based on the assumption that the most relevant SCF corresponding to a given surface form will directly emerge from the application of the constraints on the various candidates, as postulated by OT.\nASSCI takes raw corpus data as input. Input text is first tagged and syntactically analyzed. Then, the system generates a list of candidate SCFs for each verb that occurs frequently enough in data (in the default setting, 200 occurrences of a given verb are necessary). ASSCI consists of three modules: a pattern extractor which extracts patterns for each target verb; a SCF builder which builds a list of candidate SCFs per verb (GEN), and a SCF filter (EVAL) which filters out SCFs deemed incorrect according to predefined parameters (CON). They are described briefly in the following sections. For a more detailed description of ASSCI, see [20]."

      "text" : "Each step of the process is fully automatic, so the output of the SCF builder is noisy due to tagging, parsing or other processing errors. It is also noisy because of the difficulty of the argument-adjunct distinction. The latter is difficult even for humans.\nMany criteria that have been defined are not usable in our case because they either depend on lexical information which the parser cannot make use of (since the task is to acquire this information) or on semantic information which even the best parsers cannot yet learn reliably. The approach here is based on the assumption that true arguments tend to occur in argument positions more frequently than adjuncts. Thus many frequent SCFs in the system output are correct.\nThe strategy is then to filter low frequency entries from the SCF builder output. This is done using the maximum likelihood estimates [24]. This simple method involves calculating the relative frequency of each SCF (for a verb) and comparing it to an empirically determined threshold. The relative frequency of the SCF i with the verb j is calculated as follows:\nrel f req(sc fi,verb j) = |sc fi,verb j| |verb j|\n|sc fi,verb j| is the number of occurrences of the SCF i with the verb j and |verb j| is the total number of occurrences of the verb j in the corpus.\nIf, for example, the frequency of the SCF SP[sur+SN] SP[en+SN] is below the empirically defined threshold, the SCF is rejected by the filter. The MLE filter is not perfect because it is based on rejecting low frequency SCFs. Although relatively more low than high frequency SCFs are incorrect, sometimes rejected frames are correct. The filter incorporates special heuristics for cases where this assumption tends to generate too many errors. With prepositional SCFs involving one PP or more, the filter determines which one is the less frequent PP. It then re-assigns the associated frequency to the same SCF without this PP.\nFor example, SP[sur+SN] SP[en+SN] could be split to 2 SCFs : SP[sur+SN] and SP[en+SN]. In this example, SP[en+SN] is the less frequent prepositional phrase and the final SCF for the sentence (1) is (5).\n(5) SP[sur+SN]\nNote that SP[en+SN] is here an adjunct."

      "heading" : "4 Some Limitations of this Approach",
      "text" : "This approach is very efficient to deal with large corpora. However, some issues remain. As the approach is based on automatic tools (especially parsers) that are far from perfect, the obtained resources always contain errors and have to be manually validated. Moreover, the system needs to get enough examples to be able to infer relevant information. Therefore, there is generally a lack of information for a lot of low productivity items (the famous “sparsity problem”).\nMore fundamentally, some constructions are difficult to acquire and characterize automatically. On the one hand, idioms are not recognized as such by most acquisition systems. On the other hand, some adjuncts appear frequently with certain verbs (eg. some verbs like dormir – to sleep – frequently appear with location complements). The system then assumes that these are arguments, whereas linguistic theory would say without any doubt that these are adjuncts. Lastly, surface cues are sometimes insufficient to recognize ambiguous constructions (cf. ...manger une glace à la vanille... vs ...manger une glace à la terrasse d’un café... — to eat a vanilla ice-cream vs to eat an ice-cream at an outdoor cafe).\nIn a traditional architecture, the filtering process incorporates in one modules the set of constraints (CON) and the evaluation function (EVAL). This makes the system less readable than if the constraints were modeled apart from the EVAL function. There is thus a need to refine the set of constraints"

      "heading" : "5.1 Refining CON",
      "text" : "The issues we have reported in the previous section do not mean that automatic methods are flawed, but they have a number of drawbacks that should be addressed. The acquisition process, based on an analysis of co-occurrences of the verb with its immediate complements (along with filtering techniques) makes the approach highly functional. It is a good approximation of the problem. However, this model does not take into account external constraints.\nThe analysis of the co-occurrences of the verb with its complement is meaningful but is not sufficient to fully grasp the problem. The fact that some phrasal complements (with a specific head noun) frequently co-occur with a given verb is most of the time useful, especially to identify idioms [25], colligations [26] and light verb constructions [27]. On the other hand, the fact that a given prepositional phrase appear with a large number of verbs may indicate that the preposition introduces an adjunct rather than an argument.\nSo, instead of simply capturing the co-occurrences of a verb with its complements, a number of important features should be taken into account:\n– indicator of the dispersion of the prepositional phrases (PP) depending on the nature of the preposition (if a PP with a given preposition appears with a wide range of different verbs, it is more likely to be a modifier); – indicator of the co-occurrence of the PP depending on the nature of the head noun (if a verb appears frequently with the same PP frame, it is more likely to form a semi-idiomatic expression);\n– indicator of the complexity of the sentence to be processed (if a sentence is complex, its analysis is less reliable).\nIn order to do this, the pattern extractor has to be modified in order to keep most of the information that were previously rejected as not relevant. These indicators then need to be calculated so as to be taken into account by EVAL."

We are currently using this last method since data annotation is very costly. However, the first approach would certainly lead to more accurate results.\nThe weight and the ranking of the different constraints must then be examined. A linear model can provide a first approximation but there are surely better ways to integrate the different constraints. Some studies provide some cues but they need to be proper evaluated in order to be integrated in this framework [5]."

It is also possible to propose tentative constructions to the linguist, when not enough occurrences are available for training. In the end, when too few examples are available, the linguist can provide relevant information to the machine. However, with a well-designed and dynamic validation process, it is possible to obtain accurate and comprehensive lexicons, using only a small fraction of the time that would be necessary to manually develop a lexicon from scratch."
