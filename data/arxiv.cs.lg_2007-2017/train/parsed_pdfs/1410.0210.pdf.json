      "text" : "As vision techniques like segmentation and object recognition begin to mature, there has been an increasing interest in broadening the scope of research to full scene understanding. But what is meant by “understanding” of a scene and how do we measure the degree of “understanding”? Most often “understanding” refers to a correct labeling of pixels, regions or bounding boxes in terms of semantic annotations. All predictions made by such methods inevitably come with uncertainties attached due to limitations in features or data or even inherent ambiguity of the visual input.\nEqually strong progress has been made on the language side, where methods have been proposed that can learn to answer questions solely from question-answer pairs [1]. These methods operate on a set of facts given to the system which is refered to as a world. Based on that knowledge the answer is inferred by marginalizing over multiple interpretations of the question. However, the correctness of the facts is a core assumption.\nWe like to unite those two research directions by addressing a question answering task based on realworld images. To combine the probabilistic output of state-of-the-art scene segmentation algorithms, we propose a Bayesian formulation that marginalizes over multiple possible worlds that correspond to different interpretations of the scene.\nTo date, we are lacking a substantial dataset that serves as a benchmark for question answering on real-world images. Such a test has high demands on “understanding” the visual input and tests a whole chain of perception, language understanding and deduction. This very much relates to the “AI-dream” of building a turing test for vision. While we are still not ready to test our vision system on completely unconstrained settings that were envisioned in early days of AI, we argue that a question-answering task on complex indoor scenes is a timely step in this direction.\nContributions: In this paper we combine automatic, semantic segmentations of real-world scenes with symbolic reasoning in a Bayesian framework by proposing a multi-world approach for automatic question answering. We introduce a novel dataset of more than 12,000 question-answer pairs\nar X\niv :1\n41 0.\n02 10\nv1 [\ncs .A\nI] 1\nO ct\n2 01\non RGBD images produced by humans, as a modern approach to a visual turing test.

Furthermore, we provide additional insights regarding the challenges that lie ahead of us by factoring out sources of error from different components."

      "text" : "Semantic parsers: Our work is mainly inspired by [1] that learns the semantic representation for the question answering task solely based on questions and answers in natural language. Although the architecture learns the mapping from weak supervision, it achieves comparable results to the semantic parsers that rely on manual annotations of logical forms ([2], [3]). In contrast to our work, [1] has never used the semantic parser to connect the natural language to the perceived world. Language and perception: Previous work [4, 5] has proposed models for the language grounding problem with the goal of connecting the meaning of the natural language sentences to a perceived world. Both methods use images as the representation of the physical world, but concentrate rather on constrained domain with images consisting of very few objects. For instance [5] considers only two mugs, monitor and table in their dataset, whereas [4] examines objects such as blocks, plastic food, and building bricks. In contrast, our work focuses on a diverse collection of real-world indoor 3d images [6] - with many more objects in the scene and more complex spatial relationship between them. Moreover, our paper considers complex questions - beyond the scope of [4] and [5] - and reason across different images using only textual question-answer pairs for training. This imposes additional challenges for the question-answering engines such as scalability of the semantic parser, good scene representation, dealing with uncertainty in the language and perception, efficient inference and spatial reasoning. Integrated systems that execute commands: Others [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] focus on the task of learning the representation of natural language in the restricted setting of executing commands. In such scenario, the integrated systems execute commands given natural language input with the goal of using them in navigation. In our work, we aim for less restrictive scenario with the question-answering system in the mind. For instance, the user may ask our architecture about counting and colors (’How many green tables are in the image?’), negations (’Which images do not have tables?’) and superlatives (’What is the largest object in the image?’). Probabilistic databases: Similarly to [12] that reduces Named Entity Recognition problem into the inference problem from probabilistic database, we sample multiple-worlds based on the uncertainty introduced by the semantic segmentation algorithm that we apply to the visual input."

      "text" : "Our method combines natural language input with output from visual scene analysis in a probabilistic framework as illustrated in Figure 1. In the single world approach, we generate a single perceived worldW based on segmentations. Finally, we formulate a multi-world approach that integrates over many latent worldsW , so that different hypothesis are marginalized out during inference.\nSingle-world approach for question answering problem We build on recent progress on endto-end question answering systems that are solely trained on question-answer pairs (Q,A) [1, 13]. Top part of Figure 1 outlines how we build on [1] by modeling the logical forms associated with a question as latent variable T given a single world W . More formally the task of predicting an answer A given a question Q and a world W is performed by computing the following posterior which marginalizes over the latent logical forms (semantic trees in [1]) T :\nP (A|Q,W) := ∑ T P (A|T ,W)P (T |Q). (1)\nP (A|T ,W) corresponds to denotation of a logical form T on the world W . In this setting, the answer is unique given the logical form and the world: P (A|T ,W) = 1[A ∈ σW(T )] with the evaluation function σW , that evaluates a logical form on the world W . Following [1] we use DCS Trees that yield the following recursive evaluation function σW : σW(T ) :=⋂d\nj {v : v ∈ σW(p), t ∈ σW(Tj), Rj(v, t)} where T := 〈p, (T1,R1), (T2,R2), ..., (Td,Rd)〉 is\nthe semantic tree with a predicate p associated with the current node, its subtrees T1, T2, ..., Td, and relationsRj that define the relationship between the current node and a subtree Tj . The distribution over logical forms is modeled by a log-linear distribution P (T |Q) ∝ exp(θTφ(Q, T )) with feature vector φ measuring compatibility between Q and T and parameters θ learnt from training data. Every component φj is the number of times that a specific feature template occurs in (Q, T ). We use the same feature templates as [1]: string triggers a predicate, string is under a relation, string is under a trace predicate, two predicates are linked via relation and a predicate has a child. The model learns by alternating between searching over a restricted space of valid trees and gradient descent updates of the model parameters θ. We use the Datalog inference engine to produce the answers from the latent logical forms. The linguistic phenomena such as superlatives and negations are handled by the logical forms and the inference engine. For a detailed exposition, we refer the reader to [1].\nQuestion answering on real-world images based on a perceived world Similar to [5], we extend the work of [1] to operate now on what we call perceived world W . This still corresponds to the single world approach in our overview Figure 1. However our world is now populated with “facts” derived from automatic, semantic image segmentations S and we also define predicates that are spatial relations in visual scenes. Therefore, we build this world by running a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation algorithm [14] over the images, collecting the recognized information about objects such as object class, 3D position, and color (Figure 1 - middle part). Every object hypothesis is therefore represented as an n-tuple:\npredicate(instance id, image id, color, spatial loc) where predicate ∈ {bag, bed, books, ...}, instance id is the object’s id, image id is id of the image containing the object, color is estimated color of the object [15], and spatial loc is the object’s position in the image. Latter is represented as (Xmin, Xmax, Xmean, Ymin, Ymax, Ymean, Zmin, Zmax, Zmean) and defines minimal, maximal, and mean location of the object along X,Y, Z axes. To obtain the coordinates we fit axis parallel cuboids to the cropped 3d objects based on the semantic segmentation. Note that the X,Y, Z coordinate system is aligned with direction of gravity [14]. As shown in Figure 2b, this is a more meaningful representation of the object’s coordinates over simple image coordinates. The complete schema will be documented together with the code release.\nWe realize that the skilled use of spatial relations is a complex task and grounding spatial relations is a research thread on its own (e.g. [16] and [17]). For our purposes, we focus on predefined relations defined in Table 1, while the association of them as well as the object classes are still dealt within the question answering architecture.\nMulti-worlds approach for combining uncertain visual perception and symbolic reasoning Up to now, we have considered the output of the semantic segmentation as “hard facts”. We now draw on ideas from probabilistic databases [12] and propose a multi-world approach as outlined in the lower part of Figure 1 that takes the uncertainty in the segmentation of the visual input into account by marginalizing over multiple possible worlds W derived from the segmentation S. The posterior over the answer A given question Q and semantic segmentation S of the image is calculated according to a Bayesian formulation by marginalizing over the latent worldsW in addition to the logical forms T :\nP (A | Q,S) = ∑ W ∑ T P (A | W, T )P (W | S) P (T | Q) (2)\nThe semantic segmentation of the image is a set of segments si with the associated probabilities pij over the C object categories cj . More precisely S = {(s1, L1), (s2, L2), ..., (sk, Lk)} where Li = {(cj , pij)}Cj=1, P (si = cj) = pij , and k is the number of segments of given image. Let Ŝf = { (s1, cf(1)), (s2, cf(2)), ..., (sk, cf(k))) } be an assignment of the categories into segments of the image according to the binding function f ∈ F = {1, ..., C}{1,...,k}. Using such notation, for a fixed binding function f , a worldW is a set of tuples consistent with Ŝf , and define P (W |S) =∏\ni p(i,f(i)). Hence we have as many possible words as binding functions, that is C k. Eq. 2 becomes quickly intractable for k and C seen in practice, wherefore we use a sampling strategy that draws a finite sample ~W = (W1,W2, ...,WN ) from P (·|S):\nP (A | Q,S) = 1 N N∑ a=1 ∑ T P (A | Wa, T )P (T |Q) (3)\nunder an assumption that for each segment si every object’s category cj is drawn independently according to pij . A few sampled perceived worlds are shown in Figure 2a.\nRegarding the computational efficiency, computing ∑\nT P (A | Wi, T )P (T | Q) can be done independently for every Wi, and therefore in parallel without any need for synchronization. Since for small N the computational costs of summing up computed probabilities is marginal, the overall cost is about the same as single inference modulo parallelism. The presented multi-world approach to question answering on real-world scenes is still an end-to-end architecture that is trained solely on the question-answer pairs.\nImplementation and Scalability For worlds containing many facts and spatial relations the induction step becomes computationally demanding as it considers all pairs of the facts (we have about 4 million predicates in the worst case). Therefore we use a batch-based approximation in such situations. Every image induces a set of facts that we call a batch of facts. For every test image, we find k nearest neighbors in the space of training batches with a boolean variant of TF.IDF to measure similarity [18]. This is equivalent to building a training world from k images with most similar content to the perceived world of the test image. We use k = 3 and 25 worlds in our experiments. Dataset and code will be released at time of publication."

      "text" : "Images and Semantic Segmentation Our new dataset for question answering is built on top of the NYU-Depth V2 dataset [6]. NYU-Depth V2 contains 1449 RGBD images together with annotated semantic segmentations (Figure 3) where every pixel is labeled into some object class with a confidence score. Originally 894 classes are considered. According to [14], we preprocess the data to obtain canonical views of the scenes and use X , Y , Z coordinates from the depth sensor to define spatial placement of the objects in 3D. To investigate the impact of uncertainty in the visual analysis of the scenes, we also employ computer vision techniques for automatic semantic segmentation. We use a state-of-the-art scene analysis method [14] which maps every pixel into 40 classes: 37 informative object classes as well as ’other structure’, ’other furniture’ and ’other prop’. We ignore the latter three. We use the same data split as [14]: 795 training and 654 test images. To use our spatial representation on the image content, we fit 3d cuboids to the segmentations.\nNew dataset of questions and answers In the spirit of a visual turing test, we collect question answer pairs from human annotators for the NYU dataset. In our work, we consider two types of the annotations: synthetic and human. The synthetic question-answer pairs are automatically generated question-answer pairs, which are based on the templates shown in Table 2. These templates are then instantiated with facts from the database. To collect 12468 human question-answer pairs we ask 5 participants to provide questions and answers. They were instructed to give valid answers that are either basic colors [15], numbers or objects (894 categories) or sets of those. Besides the answers,\nwe don’t impose any constraints on the questions. We also don’t correct the questions as we believe that the semantic parsers should be robust under the human errors. Finally, we use 6794 training and 5674 test question-answer pairs – about 9 pairs per image on average1. The database exhibit some biases showing humans tend to focus on a few prominent objects. For instance we have more than 400 occurrences of table and chair in the answers. In average the object’s category occurs about 4 times in training set and about 6 times in total. Figure 4 shows example question-answer pairs together with the corresponding image that illustrate some of the challenges captured in this dataset.\nPerformance Measure While the quality of an answer that the system produces can be measured in terms of accuracy w.r.t. the ground truth (correct/wrong), we propose, an inspired from the work on Fuzzy Sets [20], a soft measure based on the WUP score [21], which we call WUPS (WUP Set) score. As the number of classes grows, the semantic boundaries between them are becoming more fuzzy. For example, both concepts ’carton’ and ’box’ have similar meaning, or ’cup’ and ’cup of coffee’ are almost indifferent. Therefore we seek a metric that measures the quality of an answer and penalizes naive solutions where the architecture outputs too many or too few answers. Standard Accuracy is defined as: 1N ∑N i=1 1{Ai = T i} · 100 where Ai, T i are i-th answer and ground-truth respectively. Since both the answers may include more than one object, it is beneficial to represent them as sets of the objects T = {t1, t2, ...}. From this point of view we have for every i ∈ {1, 2, ..., N}:\n1{Ai = T i} = 1{Ai ⊆ T i ∩ T i ⊆ Ai} = min{1{Ai ⊆ T i}, 1{T i ⊆ Ai}} (4) = min{ ∏ a∈Ai 1{a ∈ T i}, ∏ t∈T i 1{t ∈ Ai}} ≈ min{ ∏ a∈Ai µ(a ∈ T i), ∏ t∈T i µ(t ∈ Ai)} (5)\nWe use a soft equivalent of the intersection operator in Eq. 4, and a set membership measure µ, with properties µ(x ∈ X) = 1 if x ∈ X , µ(x ∈ X) = maxy∈X µ(x = y) and µ(x = y) ∈ [0, 1], in Eq. 5 with equality whenever µ = 1. For µ we use a variant of Wu-Palmer similarity [21, 22]. WUP(a, b) calculates similarity based on the depth of two words a and b in the taxonomy[23, 24], and define the WUPS score:\nWUPS(A, T ) = 1\nN N∑ i=1 min{ ∏ a∈Ai max t∈T i WUP(a, t), ∏ t∈T i max a∈Ai WUP(a, t)} · 100 (6)\nEmpirically, we have found that in our task a WUP score of around 0.9 is required for precise answers. Therefore we have implemented down-weighting WUP(a, b) by one order of magnitude (0.1 · WUP) whenever WUP(a, b) < t for a threshold t. We plot a curve over thresholds t ranging from 0 to 1 (Figure 5). Since ”WUPS at 0” refers to the most ’forgivable’ measure without any down-weighting and ”WUPS at 0.9” aims for high precision, Figure 5 require answers with precision ranging from low to high. Here we show some examples of the pure WUP score to give intuitions about the range: WUP(curtain, blinds) = 0.94, WUP(carton, box) = 0.94, WUP(stove, fire extinguisher) = 0.82."

First, the human annotations exhibit more variations than the synthetic approach based on templates. Second, the questions are typically longer and include more spatially related objects. Figure 4 shows a few samples from our dataset that highlights challenges including complex and nested spatial reference and use of reference frames. We yield an accuracy of 7.86% in this scenario. As argued above, we also evaluate the experiments on the human data under the softer WUPS scores given different thresholds (Table 4 and Figure 5). In order to put these numbers in perspective, we also show performance numbers for two simple methods: predicting the most popular answer yields 4.4% Accuracy, and our untrained architecture gives 0.18% and 1.3% Accuracy and WUPS (at 0.9). Based on human segmentations 37 classes (HumanSeg, 37 classes) (2nd row in Table 4) uses human segmentation and question-answer pairs. Since only 37 classes are supported by our automatic segmentation algorithm, we run on a subset of the whole dataset. We choose the 25 test images yielding a total of 286 question answer pairs for the following experiments. This yields 12.47% and 15.89% Accuracy and WUPS at 0.9 respectively. Based on automatic segmentations (AutoSeg, 37 classes) (3rd row in Table 4) Switching from the human segmentations to the automatic yields again a drop from 12.47% to 9.69% in Accuracy and we observe a similar trend for the whole spectrum of the WUPS scores. Based on automatic segmentations using multi-world approach (AutoSeg, 37 classes, multi) (4th row in Table 4) Similar to the synthetic experiments our proposed multi-world approach yields an improvement across all the measure that we investigate. Human baseline (5th and 6th rows in Table 4 for 894 and 37 classes) shows human predictions on our dataset. We ask independent annotators to provide answers on the questions we have collected. They are instructed to answer with a number, basic colors [15], or objects (from 37 or 894 categories) or set of those. This performance gives a practical upper bound for the question-answering algorithms with an accuracy of 60.27% for the 37 class case and 50.20% for the 894 class case."
