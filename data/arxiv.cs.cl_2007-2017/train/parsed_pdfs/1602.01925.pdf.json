      "text" : "Vector-space representations of words are widely used in statistical models of natural language. In addition to improvements on standard monolingual NLP tasks (Collobert and Weston, 2008), shared representation of words across languages offer intriguing possibilities (Klementiev et al., 2012). For example, in machine translation, translating a word never seen in parallel data may be overcome by seeking its vector-space neighbors, provided the embeddings are learned from both plentiful monolingual corpora and more limited parallel data. A second opportunity comes from transfer learning, in which models trained in one language can be deployed in other languages. While previous work has used hand-engineered features that are cross-linguistically stable as the basis model transfer (Zeman and Resnik, 2008;\nMcDonald et al., 2011), automatically learned embeddings offer the promise of better generalization at lower cost (Klementiev et al., 2012; Hermann and Blunsom, 2014; Guo et al., 2016). We therefore conjecture that developing estimation methods for “massively” multilingual word embeddings (i.e., embeddings for words in a large number of languages) will play an important role in the future of multilingual NLP.\nThis paper makes the following contributions to this area. First, we articulate the desiderata for multilingual embeddings and propose two new estimation methods that fulfill these (§2). These methods are designed to use only monolingual data in each language and pairwise parallel dictionaries (no parallel corpora are required), and they scale to any number of languages (a number of previous models have been limited to only pairs of languages). Second, we propose an automatic evaluation methodology designed to test how well these goals are fulfilled (§3). This includes multiQVEC+, an inexpensive to compute evaluation which correlates well with performance on two downstream multilingual tasks, cross-lingual document categorization and cross-lingual parsing. Although intrinsic evaluations will never be perfect,1 a standard set of evaluation metrics will help drive research. We evaluate our two proposed methods and two existing methods on various sets of languages consisting of 3, 12, and 59 languages (§5). Our proposed methods outperform existing methods on existing intrinsic metrics, the two extrinsic tasks, and our newly proposed\n1Goodhart’s eponymous law warns that “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.”\nmultiQVEC+. Finally, in addition to an open-source implementation of our methods, we include a link to a public web portal for uploading arbitrary multilingual embeddings and evaluating them automatically using a suite of intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation methods (§4)."

Our goal is to estimate a partial embedding function E : L × V 7→ Rd (allowing a surface form that appears in two languages to have different vectors in each). We would like to estimate this function such that: (i) semantically similar words in the same language are nearby, (ii) translationally equivalent words in different languages are nearby, and (iii) the domain of the function covers as many words in V as possible.\nWe use distributional similarity in a monolingual corpus Mm to model semantic similarity between words in the same language. For cross-lingual similarity, either a parallel corpus Pm,n or a bilingual dictionary Dm,n ⊂ Vm × Vn can be used. Our methods focus on the latter, in some cases extracting Dm,n from a parallel corpus.2\nWith three notable exceptions (see §2.3, §2.4, §6), previous work on multilingual embeddings only considered the bilingual case, | L |= 2. In this section, we focus on estimating multilingual embeddings for | L |> 2 and describe two novel methods (multiCluster and multiCCA), then review the translation-invariance matrix factorization method (Gardner et al., 2015) and a variant of the multiSkip method (Guo et al., 2016).3\n2To do this, we align the corpus using fast align (Dyer et al., 2013) in both directions. The estimated parameters of the word translation distributions are used to select pairs: Dm,n = {\n(u, v) | u ∈ Vm, v ∈ Vn, pm|n(u | v)× pn|m(v | u) > τ }\n, where the threshold τ trades off dictionary recall and precision. We fixed τ = 0.1 early on based on manual inspection of the resulting dictionaries.\n3We developed the multiSkip method independently of Guo et al. (2016)."

We use a bilingual dictionary to find clusters of translationally equivalent words, then use distributional similarities of the clusters in monolingual corpora from all languages in L to estimate an embedding for each cluster. By forcing words from different languages in a cluster to share the same embedding, we create anchor points in the vector space to bridge languages.\nMore specifically, we define the clusters as the connected components in a graph where nodes are (language, surface form) pairs and edges correspond to translation entries in Dm,n. We assign arbitrary IDs to the clusters and replace each word token in each monolingual corpus with the corresponding cluster ID, and concatenate all modified corpora. The resulting corpus consists of multilingual cluster ID sequences. We can then apply any monolingual embedding estimator; here, we use the skipgram model from Mikolov et al. (2013a)."

      "text" : "Faruqui and Dyer (2014) proposed a bilingual embedding estimation method based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and showed that the resulting embeddings for English words outperform monolingually-trained English embeddings on word similarity tasks. First, they use monolingual corpora to train monolingual embeddings for each language independently (Em and En), capturing semantic similarity within each language separately. Then, using a bilingual dictionary Dm,n, they use CCA to estimate linear projections from the ranges of the monolingual embeddings Em and En, yielding a bilingual embedding Em,n. The linear projections are defined by Tm→m,n and Tn→m,n ∈ Rd×d; they are selected to maximize the correlation between Tm→m,nEm(u) and Tn→m,nEn(v) where (u, v) ∈ Dm,n. The bilingual embedding is then defined as ECCA(m, u) = Tm→m,nEm(u) (and likewise for ECCA(n, v)).\nIn this work, we use this method as a building block to construct multilingual embeddings for more\nlanguages. We let the vector space of the initial (monolingual) English embeddings serve as the multilingual vector space (since English typically offers the largest corpora and wide availability of bilingual dictionaries). We then estimate projections from the monolingual embeddings of the other languages into the English space.\nWe start by estimating, for each m ∈ L \\ {en}, the two projection matrices: Tm→m,en and Ten→m,en; these are guaranteed to be non-singular. We then define the multilingual embedding as ECCA(en, u) = Een(u) for u ∈ Ven, and ECCA(m, v) = T−1en→m,enTm→m,enE\nm(v) for v ∈ Vm,m ∈ L \\ {en}.\nThough not explored here, this approach generalizes even without a single “hub” language (English) with which every other language shares a bilingual dictionary. If the languages are all connected by bilingual dictionaries, then we can select any spanning tree of the “language graph” induced by the bilingual dictionaries, and any language as the “root.” Words in any language can be iteratively projected into the vector spaces along the path to the root using the technique described above. In future work, non-linear transformations might be explored as well."

      "text" : "Luong et al. (2015b) proposed a method for estimating a bilingual embedding which only makes use of parallel data; it extends the skipgram model of Mikolov et al. (2013a).

(2015b) estimate conditional models of words in both source and target positions. The source positions are selected as sentential contexts (similar to monolingual skipgram), and the bilingual contexts come from aligned words. The bilingual objective is to maximize:\n∑\ni∈m-pos(Pm,n)\n∑\nk∈{−K,...,−1,1,...,K}\nlog p(ui+k | ui) + log p(va(i)+k | ui)\n+ ∑\nj∈n-pos(Pm,n)\n∑\nk∈{−K,...,−1,1,...,K}\nlog p(vj+k | vj) + log p(ua(j)+k | vj)\n(1)\nwhere m-pos(Pm,n) and n-pos(Pm,n) are the indeces of the source and target tokens in the parallel corpus respectively, a(i) and a(j) are the positions of words that align to i and j in the other language.

This approach is limited because it cannot measure the degree to which embeddings from different languages are similar (ii).

      "heading" : "3.3 Correlation-based evaluation",
      "text" : "We introduce QVEC+—an intrinsic evaluation measure of the quality of monolingual and multilingual word embeddings. Our method is a monolingual improvement and a multilingual extension of QVEC—a recently proposed monolingual evaluation based on alignment of embeddings to a matrix of features extracted from a linguistic resource (Tsvetkov et al., 2015). We review QVEC, and then describe QVEC+.\nQVEC. The main idea behind QVEC is to quantify the linguistic content of word embeddings by maximizing the correlation with a manually-annotated linguistic resource. Let the number of common words in the vocabulary of the word embeddings and the linguistic resource be N. To quantify the semantic content of embeddings, a semantic linguistic matrix S ∈ RP×N is constructed from a semantic database, with a column vector for each word. Each word vector is a distribution of the word over P linguistic properties, based on annotations of the word in the database. Let X ∈ RD×N be embedding matrix with every row as a dimension vector x ∈ R1×N . D denotes the dimensionality of word embeddings. Then, S and X are aligned to maximize the cumulative correlation between the aligned dimensions of the two matrices. Specifically, let A ∈ {0, 1}D×P be a matrix of alignments such that aij = 1 iff xi is aligned to sj, otherwise aij = 0. If r(xi, sj) is the Pearson’s correlation between vectors xi and sj, then\nQVEC is defined as:\nQVEC = maxA:∑j aij≤1\nX∑\ni=1\nS∑\nj=1\nr(xi, sj)× aij\nThe constraint ∑\nj aij ≤ 1, warrants that one distributional dimension is aligned to at most one linguistic dimension.\nQVEC has been shown to correlate strongly with downstream semantic tasks. However, it suffers from two major weaknesses. First, it is not invariant to linear transformations of the embeddings’ basis, whereas the bases in word embeddings are generally arbitrary (Szegedy et al., 2014). Second, a sum of correlations produces an unnormalized score: the more dimensions in the embedding matrix the higher the score. This precludes comparison of models of different dimensionality. QVEC+ simultaneously addresses both problems.\nQVEC+. To measure correlation between the embedding matrix X and the linguistic matrix S, instead of cumulative dimension-wise correlation we employ CCA. CCA finds two sets of basis vectors, one for X⊤ and the other for S⊤, such that the correlations between the projections of the matrices onto these basis vectors are maximized. Formally, CCA finds a pair of basis vectors v and w such that\nQVEC+ = CCA(X⊤,S⊤) = maxv,w r(X ⊤v,S⊤w)\nThus, QVEC+ ensures invariance to the matrices bases rotation, and since it is a single correlation, it produces a score in [−1, 1]. Both QVEC and QVEC+ rely on a matrix of linguistic properties constructed from a manually crafted linguistic resource. In this paper, instead of only constructing the linguistic matrix based on monolingual annotations, we use supersense tag annotations for English (Miller et al., 1993), Danish (Martınez Alonso et al., 2015) and Italian (Montemagni et al., 2003) to create extensions of QVEC and QVEC+ for the multilingual case; henceforth, multiQVEC and multiQVEC+."

While most previous work which used this data only in a bilingual setup, we simultaneously train the classifier on documents in seven languages,4 and evaluate on the development/test section of those languages.

This is especially true for the multiCluster method because using bilingual dictionaries for more languages result in conflating more and more words in the same cluster, and all words in the same cluster share the same embedding.
